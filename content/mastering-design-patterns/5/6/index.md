## 5.6. Mediator Pattern

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that facilitates communication between different objects in a system by introducing a mediator object. This pattern is particularly useful in complex systems where multiple objects interact with each other, leading to a tangled web of dependencies. By centralizing communication through a mediator, the pattern reduces direct dependencies between objects, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Mediator Pattern is to reduce the complexity of communication between objects in a system. In many applications, objects need to interact with each other to perform their tasks. Without a mediator, each object would need to know about other objects, leading to a tightly coupled system. This tight coupling makes the system difficult to maintain and extend.

**Motivation:**

- **Reducing Direct Communications:** By introducing a mediator, objects no longer communicate directly with each other. Instead, they communicate through the mediator, which handles the interactions. This reduces the number of dependencies each object has, leading to a more decoupled and flexible system.
  
- **Simplifying Complex Systems:** In systems with many interacting components, managing the interactions can become cumbersome. The mediator pattern simplifies this by centralizing the communication logic in a single place, making it easier to manage and modify.

- **Enhancing Reusability and Maintainability:** With reduced dependencies, objects become more reusable, and the system becomes easier to maintain. Changes to one object do not ripple through the system, as the mediator handles the communication.

### Key Participants

1. **Mediator Interface:** Defines the interface for communication between Colleague objects.
2. **Concrete Mediator:** Implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between Colleague objects.
3. **Colleague Objects:** Objects that communicate with each other through the Mediator.

### Applicability

Use the Mediator Pattern when:

- You have a complex set of interactions between multiple objects.
- You want to reduce the dependencies between interacting objects.
- You need to centralize control logic that affects multiple objects.

### Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a pseudocode implementation of the Mediator Pattern. We'll consider a simple chat application where users can send messages to each other. The mediator will handle the communication between users.

#### Step 1: Define the Mediator Interface

```pseudocode
// Mediator interface
interface ChatMediator {
    method sendMessage(message: String, user: User)
    method addUser(user: User)
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Concrete Mediator

```pseudocode
// Concrete Mediator
class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    private users: List<User> = []

    method addUser(user: User) {
        users.add(user)
    }

    method sendMessage(message: String, user: User) {
        for each u in users {
            if u != user {
                u.receive(message)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Colleague Interface

```pseudocode
// Colleague interface
abstract class User {
    protected mediator: ChatMediator
    protected name: String

    constructor(mediator: ChatMediator, name: String) {
        this.mediator = mediator
        this.name = name
    }

    abstract method send(message: String)
    abstract method receive(message: String)
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement Concrete Colleagues

```pseudocode
// Concrete Colleague
class ChatUser extends User {
    method send(message: String) {
        print(name + " sends: " + message)
        mediator.sendMessage(message, this)
    }

    method receive(message: String) {
        print(name + " receives: " + message)
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Demonstrate the Pattern

```pseudocode
// Client code
mediator = new ChatRoom()

user1 = new ChatUser(mediator, "Alice")
user2 = new ChatUser(mediator, "Bob")
user3 = new ChatUser(mediator, "Charlie")

mediator.addUser(user1)
mediator.addUser(user2)
mediator.addUser(user3)

user1.send("Hello, everyone!")
```

### Benefits in Complex Systems

The Mediator Pattern offers several benefits in complex systems:

- **Decoupling:** By reducing direct dependencies between objects, the mediator pattern decouples the system, making it easier to manage and extend.
- **Centralized Control:** The mediator centralizes the control logic, making it easier to understand and modify the interactions between objects.
- **Enhanced Reusability:** With reduced dependencies, objects become more reusable across different contexts.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Changes to one object do not affect others, as the mediator handles the communication.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Mediator Pattern, consider the following:

- **Complexity of the Mediator:** While the mediator simplifies the interactions between objects, it can become complex if it handles too many interactions. It's important to balance the responsibilities of the mediator to avoid creating a "god object."
- **Performance:** The mediator can introduce a performance overhead, as all interactions go through it. Ensure that the mediator is optimized for performance.
- **Scalability:** In large systems, the mediator can become a bottleneck. Consider using multiple mediators or a hierarchical mediator structure to improve scalability.

### Differences and Similarities

The Mediator Pattern is often confused with the Observer Pattern. While both patterns facilitate communication between objects, they do so in different ways:

- **Mediator vs. Observer:**
  - The Mediator Pattern centralizes communication through a mediator object, reducing direct dependencies between objects.
  - The Observer Pattern allows objects to subscribe to events and be notified when those events occur, without direct communication between the objects.

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

To better understand the Mediator Pattern, let's visualize the interactions between the mediator and colleague objects using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User1 as Alice
    participant User2 as Bob
    participant Mediator as ChatRoom

    User1->>Mediator: sendMessage("Hello, everyone!")
    Mediator->>User2: receive("Hello, everyone!")
    Mediator->>User3: receive("Hello, everyone!")
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **User1 (Alice)** sends a message to the **Mediator (ChatRoom)**.
- The **Mediator** forwards the message to all other users (**User2 (Bob)** and **User3 (Charlie)**).

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Mediator Pattern, try modifying the pseudocode examples:

- **Add a new user type:** Create a new type of user, such as an AdminUser, with additional privileges or behaviors.
- **Implement private messaging:** Modify the mediator to support private messages between users.
- **Log messages:** Add functionality to log all messages sent through the mediator.
