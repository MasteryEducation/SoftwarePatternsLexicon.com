## 5.11. Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a fundamental behavioral design pattern that plays a crucial role in defining the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you have a fixed sequence of steps, but some of those steps can vary depending on the context or subclass implementation. Let's dive into the intricacies of this pattern, its intent, motivation, and how to effectively implement it using pseudocode.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Template Method Pattern is to define the overall structure of an algorithm in a base class while allowing subclasses to refine specific steps of the algorithm. This approach promotes code reuse and enforces a consistent algorithm structure across different implementations.

#### Key Motivations:

1. **Code Reuse**: By defining the common algorithm structure in a base class, you avoid duplicating code across subclasses. This makes maintenance easier and reduces the likelihood of errors.

2. **Consistency**: The pattern ensures that the algorithm's structure remains consistent across different implementations, which is essential for maintaining predictable behavior.

3. **Flexibility**: Subclasses can override specific steps of the algorithm to provide custom behavior without altering the overall structure.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: The pattern separates the invariant parts of the algorithm from the variant parts, allowing developers to focus on specific aspects of the implementation.

### Defining Algorithms in Base Classes

In the Template Method Pattern, the base class defines the template method, which outlines the algorithm's structure. This method calls other methods, some of which may be abstract or have default implementations. Subclasses can override these methods to provide specific behavior.

#### Example Structure:

```pseudocode
class BaseAlgorithm:
    method templateMethod():
        stepOne()
        stepTwo()
        stepThree()

    method stepOne():
        // Default implementation or abstract method

    method stepTwo():
        // Default implementation or abstract method

    method stepThree():
        // Default implementation or abstract method
```

In this structure, `templateMethod` is the template method that defines the algorithm's skeleton. `stepOne`, `stepTwo`, and `stepThree` are the steps that subclasses can override to customize the behavior.

### Pseudocode Implementation

Let's illustrate the Template Method Pattern with a practical example using pseudocode. Consider a scenario where we have a base class `DocumentProcessor` that defines the steps for processing a document. Subclasses can provide specific implementations for different document types.

```pseudocode
class DocumentProcessor:
    method processDocument():
        openDocument()
        parseDocument()
        closeDocument()

    method openDocument():
        // Default implementation for opening a document

    method parseDocument():
        // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses

    method closeDocument():
        // Default implementation for closing a document

class XMLDocumentProcessor extends DocumentProcessor:
    method parseDocument():
        // Implementation for parsing XML documents

class JSONDocumentProcessor extends DocumentProcessor:
    method parseDocument():
        // Implementation for parsing JSON documents
```

In this example, `DocumentProcessor` defines the template method `processDocument`, which outlines the steps for processing a document. Subclasses `XMLDocumentProcessor` and `JSONDocumentProcessor` provide specific implementations for parsing XML and JSON documents, respectively.

### Hook Methods and Variations

Hook methods are optional methods in the base class that subclasses can override to add additional behavior or modify the algorithm's flow. These methods are not mandatory to override, providing flexibility to subclasses.

#### Example with Hook Methods:

```pseudocode
class Game:
    method play():
        startGame()
        while not isGameOver():
            playTurn()
        endGame()

    method startGame():
        // Default implementation

    method playTurn():
        // Abstract method

    method endGame():
        // Default implementation

    method isGameOver():
        return false // Default implementation

class ChessGame extends Game:
    method playTurn():
        // Implementation for playing a turn in chess

    method isGameOver():
        // Custom implementation to determine if the game is over
```

In this example, `isGameOver` is a hook method that `ChessGame` overrides to provide custom logic for determining when the game ends.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

To better understand the Template Method Pattern, let's visualize the relationship between the base class and subclasses using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BaseAlgorithm {
        +templateMethod()
        +stepOne()
        +stepTwo()
        +stepThree()
    }

    class ConcreteAlgorithmA {
        +stepTwo()
    }

    class ConcreteAlgorithmB {
        +stepThree()
    }

    BaseAlgorithm <|-- ConcreteAlgorithmA
    BaseAlgorithm <|-- ConcreteAlgorithmB
```

**Diagram Description:** This class diagram illustrates the Template Method Pattern, where `BaseAlgorithm` defines the template method and abstract steps. `ConcreteAlgorithmA` and `ConcreteAlgorithmB` are subclasses that provide specific implementations for different steps.

### Key Participants

1. **Abstract Class (Base Class)**: Defines the template method and the steps of the algorithm. It may provide default implementations for some steps.

2. **Concrete Class (Subclass)**: Implements the specific steps of the algorithm by overriding the methods defined in the abstract class.

### Applicability

Consider using the Template Method Pattern when:

- You have an algorithm with a fixed structure but variable steps.
- You want to enforce a consistent algorithm structure across different implementations.
- You need to provide default behavior for some steps while allowing customization for others.

### Sample Code Snippets

Here are some additional pseudocode examples to illustrate different use cases of the Template Method Pattern.

#### Example 1: Cooking Recipe

```pseudocode
class CookingRecipe:
    method cook():
        prepareIngredients()
        cookDish()
        serve()

    method prepareIngredients():
        // Default implementation

    method cookDish():
        // Abstract method

    method serve():
        // Default implementation

class PastaRecipe extends CookingRecipe:
    method cookDish():
        // Implementation for cooking pasta
```

#### Example 2: Data Processing

```pseudocode
class DataProcessor:
    method processData():
        loadData()
        processData()
        saveData()

    method loadData():
        // Default implementation

    method processData():
        // Abstract method

    method saveData():
        // Default implementation

class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor:
    method processData():
        // Implementation for processing CSV data
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Template Method Pattern, consider the following:

- **Granularity**: Ensure that the steps defined in the base class are at the right level of granularity. Too fine-grained steps can lead to unnecessary complexity, while too coarse-grained steps may limit flexibility.

- **Default Implementations**: Provide sensible default implementations for steps that are not mandatory to override. This can simplify subclass implementations.

- **Hook Methods**: Use hook methods to allow subclasses to modify the algorithm's flow without requiring them to override every step.

- **Documentation**: Clearly document the purpose and expected behavior of each step in the base class to guide subclass implementations.

### Differences and Similarities

The Template Method Pattern is often compared to other patterns, such as the Strategy Pattern and the Factory Method Pattern. Here are some key differences and similarities:

- **Template Method vs. Strategy Pattern**: The Template Method Pattern defines the algorithm's structure in a base class, while the Strategy Pattern encapsulates the algorithm in separate strategy classes. The Template Method Pattern is more suitable when the algorithm's structure is fixed, whereas the Strategy Pattern provides more flexibility for changing the entire algorithm.

- **Template Method vs. Factory Method Pattern**: Both patterns involve defining steps in a base class and allowing subclasses to override them. However, the Factory Method Pattern focuses on object creation, while the Template Method Pattern focuses on defining an algorithm's structure.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Template Method Pattern, try modifying the pseudocode examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- **Add a New Document Type**: Extend the `DocumentProcessor` example by adding a new subclass for processing a different document type, such as CSV or PDF.

- **Customize Hook Methods**: In the `Game` example, add a new hook method to customize the game's scoring system.

- **Experiment with Default Implementations**: Modify the `CookingRecipe` example to provide default implementations for more steps and see how it affects subclass implementations.
