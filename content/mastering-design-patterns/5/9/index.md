## 5.9. State Pattern

In the realm of software design, managing the state of an object can often become complex and unwieldy. The State Pattern emerges as a powerful tool to address this challenge by allowing an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object must exhibit different behaviors in different states, and it helps in organizing code that deals with state-specific behavior.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the State Pattern is to allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is often used in scenarios where an object must behave differently depending on its current state, and it provides a clean way to encapsulate state-specific behavior.

#### Key Concepts

- **State Encapsulation**: Encapsulate the varying behavior for the different states of an object and delegate the behavior to the current state object.
- **State Transition**: Allow the object to change its state, which can result in a change of behavior.
- **Simplification of Complex Conditionals**: Replace complex conditional logic that checks for state with state-specific classes.

#### Motivation

Consider a simple example of a document editor. A document can be in various states such as Draft, Moderation, Published, and Archived. Each state has different behaviors and rules. For instance, a Draft document can be edited, but a Published document cannot. Using the State Pattern, we can encapsulate these behaviors within state classes, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

### Diagrams

To better understand the State Pattern, let's visualize it using a state diagram. This diagram will illustrate how an object transitions between different states and how each state encapsulates its behavior.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Moderation: Submit for Review
    Moderation --> Published: Approve
    Moderation --> Draft: Request Changes
    Published --> Archived: Archive
    Draft --> [*]
    Moderation --> [*]
    Published --> [*]
    Archived --> [*]
```

**Figure 1: State Diagram for Document Lifecycle**

This diagram represents a document's lifecycle, showing how it transitions from one state to another based on certain actions.

### Key Participants

The State Pattern involves several key participants:

- **Context**: This is the class that maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
- **State**: This is an interface or abstract class that defines the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.
- **ConcreteState**: These are subclasses that implement the behavior associated with a state of the Context.

### Applicability

The State Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- An object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
- Operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state.

### Sample Code Snippets

Let's delve into a pseudocode implementation of the State Pattern. We will create a simple example of a document editor with different states.

```pseudocode
// State Interface
interface DocumentState {
    method edit()
    method publish()
    method archive()
}

// Concrete States
class DraftState implements DocumentState {
    method edit() {
        print("Editing the document...")
    }
    method publish() {
        print("Submitting document for review...")
        context.setState(new ModerationState())
    }
    method archive() {
        print("Cannot archive a draft document.")
    }
}

class ModerationState implements DocumentState {
    method edit() {
        print("Cannot edit document in moderation.")
    }
    method publish() {
        print("Approving document...")
        context.setState(new PublishedState())
    }
    method archive() {
        print("Cannot archive a document in moderation.")
    }
}

class PublishedState implements DocumentState {
    method edit() {
        print("Cannot edit a published document.")
    }
    method publish() {
        print("Document is already published.")
    }
    method archive() {
        print("Archiving document...")
        context.setState(new ArchivedState())
    }
}

class ArchivedState implements DocumentState {
    method edit() {
        print("Cannot edit an archived document.")
    }
    method publish() {
        print("Cannot publish an archived document.")
    }
    method archive() {
        print("Document is already archived.")
    }
}

// Context
class Document {
    private state: DocumentState

    constructor() {
        this.state = new DraftState()
    }

    method setState(newState: DocumentState) {
        this.state = newState
    }

    method edit() {
        this.state.edit()
    }

    method publish() {
        this.state.publish()
    }

    method archive() {
        this.state.archive()
    }
}

// Usage
document = new Document()
document.edit()    // Editing the document...
document.publish() // Submitting document for review...
document.publish() // Approving document...
document.archive() // Archiving document...
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use the State Pattern when you have an object whose behavior changes based on its state, and you want to avoid complex conditional logic.
- **Pitfalls**: Be cautious of the increased number of classes, which can make the system more complex if not managed properly.

### Differences and Similarities

The State Pattern is often confused with the Strategy Pattern. While both patterns involve encapsulating behavior, the key difference is that the State Pattern is used to change the behavior of an object based on its state, whereas the Strategy Pattern is used to select an algorithm at runtime.

### Try It Yourself

To better understand the State Pattern, try modifying the pseudocode example. For instance, add a new state, such as "Rejected," and define the behaviors for this state. Experiment with transitioning between states and observe how the behavior changes.

### Visualizing State Transitions

To further enhance your understanding, let's visualize the state transitions using a sequence diagram. This diagram will illustrate how a document transitions through different states based on user actions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Document
    participant DraftState
    participant ModerationState
    participant PublishedState
    participant ArchivedState

    User->>Document: edit()
    Document->>DraftState: edit()
    DraftState-->>User: Editing the document...

    User->>Document: publish()
    Document->>DraftState: publish()
    DraftState->>Document: setState(ModerationState)
    Document->>ModerationState: publish()
    ModerationState-->>User: Approving document...

    User->>Document: archive()
    Document->>PublishedState: archive()
    PublishedState->>Document: setState(ArchivedState)
    ArchivedState-->>User: Archiving document...
```
