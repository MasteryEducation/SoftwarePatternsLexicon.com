## 13.3. Moving Features Between Objects

In the realm of software design, the ability to refactor code efficiently is a crucial skill for expert developers. Refactoring involves restructuring existing code without altering its external behavior, thereby improving its readability, maintainability, and extensibility. One of the key aspects of refactoring is moving features between objects, which can be achieved through patterns such as Move Method, Move Field, Extract Class, and Inline Class. This section delves into these patterns, providing insights, pseudocode examples, and practical applications.

### Understanding the Need for Moving Features

Before diving into specific patterns, it's essential to understand why moving features between objects is necessary. As software evolves, classes can become bloated with responsibilities, leading to code that is difficult to manage and extend. By moving methods and fields to more appropriate classes, we can achieve a cleaner and more modular design. This process aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) of the SOLID design principles, which advocates for classes to have only one reason to change.

### Move Method

#### Intent

The Move Method pattern is used when a method in a class uses more features of another class than its own. By moving the method to the class it interacts with the most, we enhance cohesion and reduce coupling.

#### Key Participants

- **Source Class**: The class where the method currently resides.
- **Target Class**: The class where the method will be moved to.

#### Applicability

Use the Move Method pattern when:

- A method in a class is more closely related to another class.
- The method accesses data from another class more frequently than its own.
- Moving the method will reduce dependencies between classes.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Here's a simple example to illustrate the Move Method pattern:

```pseudocode
// Before refactoring
class Order {
    Customer customer;

    function getDiscount() {
        if (customer.isPremium()) {
            return 0.1;
        }
        return 0.05;
    }
}

class Customer {
    function isPremium() {
        // Check if the customer is premium
    }
}

// After refactoring
class Order {
    Customer customer;
}

class Customer {
    function isPremium() {
        // Check if the customer is premium
    }

    function getDiscount() {
        if (this.isPremium()) {
            return 0.1;
        }
        return 0.05;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `getDiscount` method is moved from the `Order` class to the `Customer` class because it relies more on the `Customer` class's data.

#### Design Considerations

- **Cohesion**: Ensure that the method logically belongs to the target class.
- **Dependencies**: Check for any dependencies that might be affected by the move.
- **Access Modifiers**: Adjust access modifiers to maintain encapsulation.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Move Method pattern is often confused with the Extract Method pattern. While Move Method involves relocating an entire method to another class, Extract Method involves breaking down a method into smaller, more manageable pieces within the same class.

### Move Field

#### Intent

The Move Field pattern is used when a field in a class is more related to another class. By moving the field, we can improve data encapsulation and reduce unnecessary dependencies.

#### Key Participants

- **Source Class**: The class where the field currently resides.
- **Target Class**: The class where the field will be moved to.

#### Applicability

Use the Move Field pattern when:

- A field in a class is more closely associated with another class.
- The field is frequently accessed by another class.
- Moving the field will enhance encapsulation and reduce coupling.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Here's an example of the Move Field pattern:

```pseudocode
// Before refactoring
class Order {
    Customer customer;
    string customerName;
}

class Customer {
    // Customer details
}

// After refactoring
class Order {
    Customer customer;
}

class Customer {
    string customerName;
    // Customer details
}
```

In this example, the `customerName` field is moved from the `Order` class to the `Customer` class because it logically belongs to the `Customer`.

#### Design Considerations

- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that the field is encapsulated within the target class.
- **Access Methods**: Provide access methods if necessary to maintain functionality.
- **Impact on Other Methods**: Consider how the move affects methods that use the field.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Move Field pattern is similar to the Move Method pattern in that both involve relocating elements to improve design. However, Move Field specifically deals with data fields, whereas Move Method deals with behavior.

### Extract Class

#### Intent

The Extract Class pattern is used to split a class that has grown too large and is handling multiple responsibilities. By extracting a new class, we can adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle and improve code organization.

#### Key Participants

- **Original Class**: The class that is too large or has multiple responsibilities.
- **New Class**: The class that is created to take over some responsibilities.

#### Applicability

Use the Extract Class pattern when:

- A class is handling multiple responsibilities.
- The class has grown too large and complex.
- Extracting a new class will improve modularity and maintainability.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Here's an example of the Extract Class pattern:

```pseudocode
// Before refactoring
class Employee {
    string name;
    string address;
    string phoneNumber;
    function calculatePay() {
        // Calculate pay
    }
    function save() {
        // Save employee details
    }
}

// After refactoring
class Employee {
    string name;
    ContactDetails contactDetails;
    function calculatePay() {
        // Calculate pay
    }
}

class ContactDetails {
    string address;
    string phoneNumber;
    function save() {
        // Save contact details
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ContactDetails` class is extracted from the `Employee` class to handle contact-related information separately.

#### Design Considerations

- **Single Responsibility**: Ensure each class has a single responsibility.
- **Inter-Class Communication**: Define clear interfaces for communication between classes.
- **Code Duplication**: Avoid duplicating code during extraction.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Extract Class pattern is often compared to the Extract Method pattern. While Extract Class involves creating a new class to handle specific responsibilities, Extract Method focuses on breaking down methods within the same class.

### Inline Class

#### Intent

The Inline Class pattern is used when a class is no longer necessary and its responsibilities can be absorbed by another class. This pattern helps simplify the class structure and eliminate unnecessary abstractions.

#### Key Participants

- **Target Class**: The class that will absorb the responsibilities.
- **Inline Class**: The class that will be removed.

#### Applicability

Use the Inline Class pattern when:

- A class has become redundant or unnecessary.
- The class's responsibilities can be easily absorbed by another class.
- Inlining the class will simplify the design.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Here's an example of the Inline Class pattern:

```pseudocode
// Before refactoring
class Address {
    string street;
    string city;
    string zipCode;
}

class Customer {
    Address address;
    function getFullAddress() {
        return address.street + ", " + address.city + ", " + address.zipCode;
    }
}

// After refactoring
class Customer {
    string street;
    string city;
    string zipCode;
    function getFullAddress() {
        return street + ", " + city + ", " + zipCode;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Address` class is inlined into the `Customer` class because it was deemed unnecessary as a separate entity.

#### Design Considerations

- **Simplicity**: Ensure that inlining the class simplifies the design.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain data integrity during the inlining process.
- **Impact on Other Classes**: Consider how inlining affects other classes that interact with the inline class.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Inline Class pattern is the opposite of the Extract Class pattern. While Inline Class involves merging classes to simplify design, Extract Class involves creating new classes to distribute responsibilities.

### Visualizing the Process

Let's use a Mermaid.js diagram to visualize the process of moving features between objects, focusing on the Move Method pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Order {
        -Customer customer
        +getDiscount()
    }
    class Customer {
        +isPremium()
    }
    Order --> Customer : uses

    class OrderRefactored {
        -Customer customer
    }
    class CustomerRefactored {
        +isPremium()
        +getDiscount()
    }
    OrderRefactored --> CustomerRefactored : uses
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the transition of the `getDiscount` method from the `Order` class to the `Customer` class, showing the improved cohesion and reduced coupling.
