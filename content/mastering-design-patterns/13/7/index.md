## 13.7. Dealing with Generalization

In the realm of software design, generalization is a powerful concept that allows developers to create flexible and reusable code structures. By abstracting common functionality and characteristics into higher-level constructs, we can reduce redundancy, enhance maintainability, and promote code reuse. This section delves into the intricacies of dealing with generalization through three key refactoring patterns: Pull Up Field/Method, Push Down Method/Field, and Extract Subclass/Superclass. We'll explore these patterns in detail, providing clear pseudocode examples and diagrams to illustrate their application.

### Understanding Generalization

Generalization in software design refers to the process of abstracting common features from multiple classes into a single superclass or interface. This abstraction allows for shared behavior and attributes to be defined once and reused across different subclasses. Generalization is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is instrumental in achieving polymorphism and code reuse.

#### Key Concepts

- **Abstraction:** The process of identifying commonalities among classes and encapsulating them in a higher-level construct.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
- **Code Reuse:** The practice of using existing code for new functions or applications, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

### Pull Up Field/Method

The Pull Up Field/Method refactoring pattern involves moving common fields or methods from multiple subclasses to a shared superclass. This pattern is useful when you identify duplicated code across subclasses that can be abstracted into a single location.

#### Intent

The intent of the Pull Up Field/Method pattern is to eliminate redundancy by centralizing shared functionality in a superclass. This not only reduces code duplication but also simplifies maintenance by localizing changes to a single point.

#### Key Participants

- **Superclass:** The class to which common fields or methods are moved.
- **Subclasses:** The classes from which fields or methods are extracted.

#### Applicability

- When multiple subclasses have identical fields or methods.
- When you want to enforce a common interface or behavior across subclasses.

#### Pseudocode Example

Let's consider a scenario where we have two subclasses, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, both of which have a method `calculateArea`. We can pull up this method to a superclass `Shape`.

```pseudocode
// Before Pull Up Method
class Circle {
    method calculateArea() {
        return PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle {
    method calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

// After Pull Up Method
class Shape {
    method calculateArea() {
        // Abstract method, implementation in subclasses
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    method calculateArea() {
        return PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    method calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `calculateArea` method is defined in the superclass `Shape` as an abstract method, and each subclass provides its specific implementation.

#### Design Considerations

- Ensure that the pulled-up method or field is truly common to all subclasses.
- Consider the impact on existing code that relies on subclass-specific implementations.

### Push Down Method/Field

The Push Down Method/Field refactoring pattern is the inverse of Pull Up. It involves moving methods or fields from a superclass to specific subclasses. This pattern is useful when a method or field in a superclass is only relevant to certain subclasses.

#### Intent

The intent of the Push Down Method/Field pattern is to localize functionality that is not shared by all subclasses, thereby adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

#### Key Participants

- **Superclass:** The class from which methods or fields are moved.
- **Subclasses:** The classes to which methods or fields are moved.

#### Applicability

- When a method or field in a superclass is only used by some subclasses.
- When you want to reduce the complexity of a superclass by delegating specific responsibilities to subclasses.

#### Pseudocode Example

Consider a superclass `Vehicle` with a method `calculateFuelEfficiency` that is only applicable to some subclasses.

```pseudocode
// Before Push Down Method
class Vehicle {
    method calculateFuelEfficiency() {
        // Implementation specific to certain vehicles
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Uses calculateFuelEfficiency
}

class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    // Does not use calculateFuelEfficiency
}

// After Push Down Method
class Vehicle {
    // No calculateFuelEfficiency method
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    method calculateFuelEfficiency() {
        // Implementation specific to cars
    }
}

class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    // No calculateFuelEfficiency method
}
```

In this example, the `calculateFuelEfficiency` method is pushed down to the `Car` subclass, as it is not relevant to `Bicycle`.

#### Design Considerations

- Ensure that the pushed-down method or field is not required by other subclasses.
- Consider the impact on code that interacts with the superclass.

### Extract Subclass/Superclass

The Extract Subclass/Superclass pattern involves creating a new subclass or superclass to encapsulate specific functionality or attributes. This pattern is useful for organizing code and improving readability.

#### Intent

The intent of the Extract Subclass/Superclass pattern is to create a more organized and maintainable class hierarchy by segregating distinct responsibilities into separate classes.

#### Key Participants

- **Original Class:** The class from which functionality is extracted.
- **New Subclass/Superclass:** The class that encapsulates the extracted functionality.

#### Applicability

- When a class has multiple responsibilities that can be separated.
- When you want to create a more flexible and extensible class hierarchy.

#### Pseudocode Example

Consider a class `Employee` that handles both administrative and technical tasks. We can extract these responsibilities into separate subclasses.

```pseudocode
// Before Extract Subclass
class Employee {
    method handleAdminTasks() {
        // Administrative tasks
    }
    
    method handleTechnicalTasks() {
        // Technical tasks
    }
}

// After Extract Subclass
class Employee {
    // Common employee attributes and methods
}

class AdminEmployee extends Employee {
    method handleAdminTasks() {
        // Administrative tasks
    }
}

class TechnicalEmployee extends Employee {
    method handleTechnicalTasks() {
        // Technical tasks
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Employee` class is refactored into two subclasses, `AdminEmployee` and `TechnicalEmployee`, each handling specific responsibilities.

#### Design Considerations

- Ensure that the extracted functionality is cohesive and logically grouped.
- Consider the impact on existing code and the need for interface changes.

### Visualizing Generalization

To better understand the process of generalization, let's visualize the relationships between classes before and after applying these refactoring patterns.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        <<abstract>>
        +calculateArea()
    }
    class Circle {
        +calculateArea()
    }
    class Rectangle {
        +calculateArea()
    }
    Shape <|-- Circle
    Shape <|-- Rectangle
```

**Diagram 1: Visualizing Pull Up Method**

In this diagram, the `calculateArea` method is abstracted into the `Shape` superclass, with `Circle` and `Rectangle` providing specific implementations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Vehicle {
        // No calculateFuelEfficiency method
    }
    class Car {
        +calculateFuelEfficiency()
    }
    class Bicycle {
        // No calculateFuelEfficiency method
    }
    Vehicle <|-- Car
    Vehicle <|-- Bicycle
```

**Diagram 2: Visualizing Push Down Method**

Here, the `calculateFuelEfficiency` method is pushed down to the `Car` subclass, as it is not relevant to `Bicycle`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Employee {
        // Common employee attributes and methods
    }
    class AdminEmployee {
        +handleAdminTasks()
    }
    class TechnicalEmployee {
        +handleTechnicalTasks()
    }
    Employee <|-- AdminEmployee
    Employee <|-- TechnicalEmployee
```

**Diagram 3: Visualizing Extract Subclass**

This diagram shows the extraction of `AdminEmployee` and `TechnicalEmployee` subclasses from the `Employee` class, each handling specific responsibilities.

### Differences and Similarities

While Pull Up, Push Down, and Extract patterns all deal with generalization, they serve distinct purposes:

- **Pull Up vs. Push Down:** Pull Up centralizes shared functionality, while Push Down localizes specific functionality.
- **Extract Subclass vs. Extract Superclass:** Extract Subclass creates more specialized classes, whereas Extract Superclass creates a more generalized class.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of these patterns, try modifying the pseudocode examples:

- **Experiment with Pull Up Method:** Identify another common method or field in your codebase and pull it up to a superclass.
- **Explore Push Down Method:** Find a method in a superclass that is only used by certain subclasses and push it down.
- **Practice Extract Subclass:** Identify a class with multiple responsibilities and extract them into separate subclasses.
