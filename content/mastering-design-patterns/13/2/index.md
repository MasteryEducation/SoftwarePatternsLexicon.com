## 13.2. Composing Methods

In the realm of software development, composing methods is a crucial refactoring technique that enhances code readability, maintainability, and reusability. By breaking down complex methods into smaller, more manageable pieces, developers can create code that is easier to understand and modify. This section delves into three essential refactoring techniques: Extract Method, Inline Method, and Replace Temp with Query. Each technique serves a unique purpose and offers distinct benefits, making them invaluable tools in a developer's arsenal.

### Introduction to Composing Methods

Composing methods involves restructuring existing code to improve its structure without altering its external behavior. This practice is essential for maintaining high-quality codebases, as it allows developers to simplify complex logic, reduce duplication, and enhance the overall design of the software. By applying composing methods, developers can achieve a more modular and cohesive code structure, facilitating easier maintenance and future enhancements.

### Extract Method

#### Intent

The Extract Method refactoring technique aims to decompose a large, complex method into smaller, more focused methods. This approach enhances code readability and promotes code reuse by isolating specific functionality into distinct methods.

#### Key Participants

- **Original Method**: The method containing the logic to be extracted.
- **Extracted Method**: The new method created to encapsulate the extracted logic.

#### Applicability

Use the Extract Method when:

- A method is too long or complex, making it difficult to understand.
- A specific block of code is repeated in multiple places.
- A section of code can be given a meaningful name, improving readability.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Consider the following pseudocode example of a method that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, including tax:

```pseudocode
function calculateTotal(cart) {
    let total = 0;
    for each item in cart {
        total += item.price;
    }
    let tax = total * 0.1;
    total += tax;
    return total;
}
```

By applying the Extract Method technique, we can refactor the code as follows:

```pseudocode
function calculateTotal(cart) {
    let subtotal = calculateSubtotal(cart);
    let tax = calculateTax(subtotal);
    return subtotal + tax;
}

function calculateSubtotal(cart) {
    let total = 0;
    for each item in cart {
        total += item.price;
    }
    return total;
}

function calculateTax(subtotal) {
    return subtotal * 0.1;
}
```

In this refactored version, the `calculateSubtotal` and `calculateTax` methods encapsulate specific functionality, making the `calculateTotal` method more concise and easier to understand.

#### Design Considerations

- **Naming**: Choose meaningful names for extracted methods to convey their purpose clearly.
- **Parameters**: Ensure extracted methods receive the necessary parameters to function independently.
- **Visibility**: Consider the appropriate visibility (public, private, etc.) for extracted methods based on their usage context.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Extract Method technique is often compared to the Inline Method technique, as both involve method manipulation. However, while Extract Method focuses on breaking down methods, Inline Method aims to consolidate them.

### Inline Method

#### Intent

The Inline Method refactoring technique involves replacing a method call with the method's body. This approach is useful when a method's implementation is straightforward, and its abstraction adds unnecessary complexity.

#### Key Participants

- **Original Method**: The method to be inlined.
- **Calling Code**: The code that invokes the original method.

#### Applicability

Use the Inline Method when:

- A method is trivial and does not provide meaningful abstraction.
- The method is called only once, and inlining it simplifies the code.
- The method's name does not add clarity to its functionality.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Consider the following pseudocode example of a method that checks if a user is an administrator:

```pseudocode
function isAdmin(user) {
    return user.role == "admin";
}

function performAdminTask(user) {
    if (isAdmin(user)) {
        // Perform admin task
    }
}
```

By applying the Inline Method technique, we can refactor the code as follows:

```pseudocode
function performAdminTask(user) {
    if (user.role == "admin") {
        // Perform admin task
    }
}
```

In this refactored version, the `isAdmin` method is inlined, simplifying the `performAdminTask` method by removing an unnecessary abstraction.

#### Design Considerations

- **Readability**: Ensure that inlining a method does not reduce code readability.
- **Duplication**: Avoid inlining methods if it results in code duplication.
- **Complexity**: Consider the complexity of the inlined method's logic and whether it benefits from being a separate method.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Inline Method technique contrasts with the Extract Method technique, as it focuses on consolidating methods rather than decomposing them.

### Replace Temp with Query

#### Intent

The Replace Temp with Query refactoring technique involves replacing temporary variables with method calls. This approach enhances code clarity by eliminating intermediate variables and directly expressing the logic.

#### Key Participants

- **Temporary Variable**: The variable to be replaced.
- **Query Method**: The method that encapsulates the logic previously assigned to the temporary variable.

#### Applicability

Use Replace Temp with Query when:

- A temporary variable is used to store the result of an expression that can be encapsulated in a method.
- The logic assigned to the temporary variable is complex and benefits from being named.
- The temporary variable is used in multiple places, and a method call improves readability.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Consider the following pseudocode example of a method that calculates the discounted price of an item:

```pseudocode
function calculateDiscountedPrice(item) {
    let discount = item.price * 0.1;
    let discountedPrice = item.price - discount;
    return discountedPrice;
}
```

By applying the Replace Temp with Query technique, we can refactor the code as follows:

```pseudocode
function calculateDiscountedPrice(item) {
    return item.price - calculateDiscount(item);
}

function calculateDiscount(item) {
    return item.price * 0.1;
}
```

In this refactored version, the `calculateDiscount` method replaces the temporary variable `discount`, making the code more expressive and easier to understand.

#### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of replacing temporary variables with method calls, especially in performance-critical code.
- **Naming**: Choose descriptive names for query methods to convey their purpose clearly.
- **Reusability**: Query methods can be reused across different parts of the codebase, promoting consistency.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Replace Temp with Query technique is similar to the Extract Method technique, as both involve creating methods to encapsulate logic. However, Replace Temp with Query specifically targets temporary variables.

### Visualizing Method Composition

To better understand the process of composing methods, let's visualize the transformation of a complex method into smaller, more manageable pieces using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Method] --> B[Extract Method];
    B --> C[Extracted Method 1];
    B --> D[Extracted Method 2];
    A --> E[Inline Method];
    A --> F[Replace Temp with Query];
    F --> G[Query Method];
```

**Figure 1: Visualizing Method Composition**

In this flowchart, the original method undergoes various transformations, including extracting methods, inlining methods, and replacing temporary variables with query methods. Each transformation contributes to a more modular and cohesive code structure.

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding of composing methods, try applying these techniques to a sample codebase. Start with a complex method and identify opportunities to extract methods, inline methods, and replace temporary variables with query methods. Experiment with different approaches and observe how they impact code readability and maintainability.
