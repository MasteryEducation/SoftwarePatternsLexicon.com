## 4.1. Overview of Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns are a crucial component of software architecture, providing a blueprint for organizing code in a way that enhances flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. These patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures, emphasizing how objects and classes can be combined to form new functionalities. In this section, we will delve into the world of structural patterns, exploring the concepts of composition versus inheritance and how these patterns can be leveraged to organize code effectively.

### Composition vs. Inheritance

#### Understanding Composition

Composition is a design principle that involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones. It is based on the concept of "has-a" relationships, where one object contains or is composed of other objects. This approach allows for greater flexibility and reusability, as components can be easily swapped or modified without affecting the overall structure.

**Advantages of Composition:**

- **Flexibility:** Components can be easily replaced or extended without altering the entire system.
- **Reusability:** Individual components can be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects.
- **Encapsulation:** Each component can encapsulate its behavior, reducing dependencies and potential side effects.

**Example of Composition in Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
class Engine {
    function start() {
        // Start the engine
    }
}

class Car {
    private engine: Engine

    function __init__(engine: Engine) {
        this.engine = engine
    }

    function drive() {
        this.engine.start()
        // Drive the car
    }
}

// Usage
engine = new Engine()
car = new Car(engine)
car.drive()
```

In this example, the `Car` class is composed of an `Engine` object, demonstrating a "has-a" relationship. The `Car` class delegates the responsibility of starting the engine to the `Engine` class, promoting separation of concerns.

#### Understanding Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, forming an "is-a" relationship. This approach promotes code reuse by enabling derived classes to share common functionality with their base classes.

**Advantages of Inheritance:**

- **Code Reusability:** Common functionality can be defined in a base class and inherited by derived classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Derived classes can override or extend base class behavior, allowing for dynamic method resolution.

**Example of Inheritance in Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
class Vehicle {
    function drive() {
        // Drive the vehicle
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    function drive() {
        // Drive the car
    }
}

// Usage
car = new Car()
car.drive()
```

In this example, the `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class, forming an "is-a" relationship. The `Car` class can override the `drive` method to provide specific behavior for driving a car.

#### Composition vs. Inheritance: A Comparative Analysis

While both composition and inheritance offer ways to organize code, they have distinct differences and use cases. Understanding when to use each approach is crucial for designing flexible and maintainable software.

**Composition:**

- **Use When:** You need flexibility and the ability to change behavior at runtime.
- **Pros:** Promotes loose coupling, easier to modify or extend.
- **Cons:** Can lead to more complex object structures.

**Inheritance:**

- **Use When:** You have a clear hierarchical relationship and shared behavior.
- **Pros:** Simplifies code by sharing common functionality.
- **Cons:** Can lead to tight coupling and difficulty in modifying base class behavior.

### Organizing Code for Flexibility

Structural patterns provide a framework for organizing code in a way that enhances flexibility and adaptability. By focusing on the relationships between classes and objects, these patterns help developers create systems that are easier to maintain and extend.

#### Key Structural Patterns

Let's explore some of the key structural patterns and their applications:

1. **Adapter Pattern**

   **Intent:** Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

   **Diagram:**

   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       class Target {
           +request()
       }
       class Adapter {
           +request()
       }
       class Adaptee {
           +specificRequest()
       }
       Target <|-- Adapter
       Adapter --> Adaptee
   ```

   **Key Participants:**

   - **Target:** Defines the domain-specific interface that clients use.
   - **Adapter:** Adapts the interface of the Adaptee to the Target interface.
   - **Adaptee:** Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.

   **Applicability:** Use the Adapter pattern when you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match the one you need.

   **Sample Code Snippet:**

   ```pseudocode
   class Target {
       function request() {
           // Default request implementation
       }
   }

   class Adaptee {
       function specificRequest() {
           // Specific request implementation
       }
   }

   class Adapter extends Target {
       private adaptee: Adaptee

       function __init__(adaptee: Adaptee) {
           this.adaptee = adaptee
       }

       function request() {
           this.adaptee.specificRequest()
       }
   }

   // Usage
   adaptee = new Adaptee()
   adapter = new Adapter(adaptee)
   adapter.request()
   ```

   **Design Considerations:** The Adapter pattern is useful when you need to integrate a class with an incompatible interface into your system. It allows for greater flexibility by enabling the reuse of existing classes without modifying their code.

2. **Bridge Pattern**

   **Intent:** Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

   **Diagram:**

   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       class Abstraction {
           +operation()
       }
       class RefinedAbstraction {
           +operation()
       }
       class Implementor {
           +implementation()
       }
       class ConcreteImplementor {
           +implementation()
       }
       Abstraction <|-- RefinedAbstraction
       Abstraction --> Implementor
       Implementor <|-- ConcreteImplementor
   ```

   **Key Participants:**

   - **Abstraction:** Defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor.
   - **RefinedAbstraction:** Extends the interface defined by Abstraction.
   - **Implementor:** Defines the interface for implementation classes.
   - **ConcreteImplementor:** Implements the Implementor interface.

   **Applicability:** Use the Bridge pattern when you want to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be modified independently.

   **Sample Code Snippet:**

   ```pseudocode
   class Implementor {
       function implementation() {
           // Default implementation
       }
   }

   class ConcreteImplementor extends Implementor {
       function implementation() {
           // Specific implementation
       }
   }

   class Abstraction {
       private implementor: Implementor

       function __init__(implementor: Implementor) {
           this.implementor = implementor
       }

       function operation() {
           this.implementor.implementation()
       }
   }

   // Usage
   implementor = new ConcreteImplementor()
   abstraction = new Abstraction(implementor)
   abstraction.operation()
   ```

   **Design Considerations:** The Bridge pattern is ideal when you have multiple implementations for an abstraction and you want to switch between them dynamically. It promotes flexibility by allowing the abstraction and implementation to evolve independently.

3. **Composite Pattern**

   **Intent:** Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

   **Diagram:**

   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       class Component {
           +operation()
       }
       class Leaf {
           +operation()
       }
       class Composite {
           +operation()
           +add(Component)
           +remove(Component)
           +getChild(int)
       }
       Component <|-- Leaf
       Component <|-- Composite
   ```

   **Key Participants:**

   - **Component:** Declares the interface for objects in the composition.
   - **Leaf:** Represents leaf objects in the composition.
   - **Composite:** Defines behavior for components having children.

   **Applicability:** Use the Composite pattern when you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects and allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

   **Sample Code Snippet:**

   ```pseudocode
   class Component {
       function operation() {
           // Default operation
       }
   }

   class Leaf extends Component {
       function operation() {
           // Leaf-specific operation
       }
   }

   class Composite extends Component {
       private children: List<Component>

       function __init__() {
           this.children = new List<Component>()
       }

       function add(component: Component) {
           this.children.add(component)
       }

       function remove(component: Component) {
           this.children.remove(component)
       }

       function operation() {
           for each (child in this.children) {
               child.operation()
           }
       }
   }

   // Usage
   leaf1 = new Leaf()
   leaf2 = new Leaf()
   composite = new Composite()
   composite.add(leaf1)
   composite.add(leaf2)
   composite.operation()
   ```

   **Design Considerations:** The Composite pattern is useful for building complex tree structures where individual objects and compositions need to be treated uniformly. It simplifies client code by allowing them to interact with the composite structure as a whole.

4. **Decorator Pattern**

   **Intent:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

   **Diagram:**

   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       class Component {
           +operation()
       }
       class ConcreteComponent {
           +operation()
       }
       class Decorator {
           +operation()
       }
       class ConcreteDecorator {
           +operation()
       }
       Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
       Component <|-- Decorator
       Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecorator
   ```

   **Key Participants:**

   - **Component:** Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
   - **ConcreteComponent:** Implements the Component interface.
   - **Decorator:** Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.
   - **ConcreteDecorator:** Adds responsibilities to the component.

   **Applicability:** Use the Decorator pattern when you want to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically without affecting other objects.

   **Sample Code Snippet:**

   ```pseudocode
   class Component {
       function operation() {
           // Default operation
       }
   }

   class ConcreteComponent extends Component {
       function operation() {
           // Concrete operation
       }
   }

   class Decorator extends Component {
       protected component: Component

       function __init__(component: Component) {
           this.component = component
       }

       function operation() {
           this.component.operation()
       }
   }

   class ConcreteDecorator extends Decorator {
       function operation() {
           super.operation()
           // Additional behavior
       }
   }

   // Usage
   component = new ConcreteComponent()
   decorator = new ConcreteDecorator(component)
   decorator.operation()
   ```

   **Design Considerations:** The Decorator pattern is ideal for adding functionality to objects without altering their structure. It promotes flexibility by allowing behavior to be added or removed at runtime.

5. **Facade Pattern**

   **Intent:** Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

   **Diagram:**

   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       class Facade {
           +operation()
       }
       class SubsystemA {
           +operationA()
       }
       class SubsystemB {
           +operationB()
       }
       Facade --> SubsystemA
       Facade --> SubsystemB
   ```

   **Key Participants:**

   - **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to the subsystem.
   - **Subsystem Classes:** Implement subsystem functionality and handle work assigned by the Facade object.

   **Applicability:** Use the Facade pattern when you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

   **Sample Code Snippet:**

   ```pseudocode
   class SubsystemA {
       function operationA() {
           // Subsystem A operation
       }
   }

   class SubsystemB {
       function operationB() {
           // Subsystem B operation
       }
   }

   class Facade {
       private subsystemA: SubsystemA
       private subsystemB: SubsystemB

       function __init__(subsystemA: SubsystemA, subsystemB: SubsystemB) {
           this.subsystemA = subsystemA
           this.subsystemB = subsystemB
       }

       function operation() {
           this.subsystemA.operationA()
           this.subsystemB.operationB()
       }
   }

   // Usage
   subsystemA = new SubsystemA()
   subsystemB = new SubsystemB()
   facade = new Facade(subsystemA, subsystemB)
   facade.operation()
   ```

   **Design Considerations:** The Facade pattern is useful for simplifying interactions with complex subsystems. It provides a single point of access, reducing the number of dependencies and simplifying client code.

6. **Flyweight Pattern**

   **Intent:** Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

   **Diagram:**

   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       class Flyweight {
           +operation(extrinsicState)
       }
       class ConcreteFlyweight {
           +operation(extrinsicState)
       }
       class FlyweightFactory {
           +getFlyweight(key)
       }
       Flyweight <|-- ConcreteFlyweight
       FlyweightFactory --> Flyweight
   ```

   **Key Participants:**

   - **Flyweight:** Declares an interface through which flyweights can receive and act on extrinsic state.
   - **ConcreteFlyweight:** Implements the Flyweight interface and adds storage for intrinsic state.
   - **FlyweightFactory:** Creates and manages flyweight objects.

   **Applicability:** Use the Flyweight pattern when you need to efficiently support a large number of objects that share common state.

   **Sample Code Snippet:**

   ```pseudocode
   class Flyweight {
       function operation(extrinsicState) {
           // Default operation
       }
   }

   class ConcreteFlyweight extends Flyweight {
       function operation(extrinsicState) {
           // Concrete operation
       }
   }

   class FlyweightFactory {
       private flyweights: Map<String, Flyweight>

       function __init__() {
           this.flyweights = new Map<String, Flyweight>()
       }

       function getFlyweight(key: String): Flyweight {
           if not this.flyweights.containsKey(key) {
               this.flyweights.put(key, new ConcreteFlyweight())
           }
           return this.flyweights.get(key)
       }
   }

   // Usage
   factory = new FlyweightFactory()
   flyweight = factory.getFlyweight("key")
   flyweight.operation("extrinsicState")
   ```

   **Design Considerations:** The Flyweight pattern is ideal for optimizing memory usage when dealing with a large number of similar objects. It promotes sharing of common state while allowing for unique behavior through extrinsic state.

7. **Proxy Pattern**

   **Intent:** Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

   **Diagram:**

   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       class Subject {
           +request()
       }
       class RealSubject {
           +request()
       }
       class Proxy {
           +request()
       }
       Subject <|-- RealSubject
       Subject <|-- Proxy
   ```

   **Key Participants:**

   - **Subject:** Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy.
   - **RealSubject:** Represents the real object that the proxy represents.
   - **Proxy:** Maintains a reference to the RealSubject and controls access to it.

   **Applicability:** Use the Proxy pattern when you need to control access to an object, add additional functionality, or delay the creation of an expensive object.

   **Sample Code Snippet:**

   ```pseudocode
   class Subject {
       function request() {
           // Default request
       }
   }

   class RealSubject extends Subject {
       function request() {
           // Real request
       }
   }

   class Proxy extends Subject {
       private realSubject: RealSubject

       function request() {
           if not this.realSubject {
               this.realSubject = new RealSubject()
           }
           this.realSubject.request()
       }
   }

   // Usage
   proxy = new Proxy()
   proxy.request()
   ```

   **Design Considerations:** The Proxy pattern is useful for controlling access to objects, adding security, or managing resource-intensive objects. It provides a level of indirection that can be used for various purposes, such as lazy initialization or access control.

### Differences and Similarities Among Structural Patterns

Structural patterns share the common goal of organizing code to enhance flexibility and maintainability, but they achieve this through different mechanisms. Here are some key differences and similarities:

- **Adapter vs. Bridge:** Both patterns involve adapting interfaces, but the Adapter pattern focuses on converting an existing interface to a new one, while the Bridge pattern separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite vs. Decorator:** Both patterns involve composing objects, but the Composite pattern focuses on part-whole hierarchies, while the Decorator pattern adds responsibilities to individual objects.
- **Facade vs. Proxy:** Both patterns provide a simplified interface, but the Facade pattern simplifies interactions with a subsystem, while the Proxy pattern controls access to an object.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of structural patterns, try modifying the code examples provided. For instance, you can:

- **Adapter Pattern:** Create a new Adaptee class with a different interface and adapt it using the Adapter pattern.
- **Bridge Pattern:** Implement a new ConcreteImplementor class and switch between different implementations at runtime.
- **Composite Pattern:** Add new Leaf or Composite objects to the tree structure and observe how the operations are propagated.
- **Decorator Pattern:** Create additional ConcreteDecorator classes to add different responsibilities to the component.
- **Facade Pattern:** Add new subsystem classes and extend the Facade class to incorporate their functionality.
- **Flyweight Pattern:** Experiment with different extrinsic states and observe how the Flyweight pattern optimizes memory usage.
- **Proxy Pattern:** Implement a new Proxy class that adds additional functionality, such as logging or caching.

### Conclusion

Structural design patterns play a vital role in software architecture by providing a framework for organizing code in a way that enhances flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. By understanding the principles of composition and inheritance, and leveraging structural patterns, developers can create systems that are easier to maintain and extend. Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive systems. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
