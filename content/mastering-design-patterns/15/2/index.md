## 15.2. Event Sourcing Pattern

In the realm of software design, managing state changes efficiently and reliably is crucial. The **Event Sourcing Pattern** offers a robust solution by storing every change to the application's state as a sequence of events. This approach not only provides a complete audit trail but also enables the reconstruction of past states and supports complex business logic.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Event Sourcing Pattern is to capture all changes to an application's state as a series of events. Instead of storing only the current state, each state change is recorded as an immutable event. This allows for the reconstruction of any past state by replaying the events.

### Key Participants

- **Event Store**: A specialized database that stores events in the order they were applied.
- **Event**: Represents a change in state, typically containing a timestamp and data about the change.
- **Aggregate**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit for data changes.
- **Command**: An action that triggers a state change, resulting in one or more events.
- **Event Handler**: A component that processes events to update read models or trigger side effects.

### Applicability

Use the Event Sourcing Pattern when:

- You need a complete audit trail of all state changes.
- You want to support complex business logic that depends on historical data.
- You require the ability to reconstruct past states for debugging or analysis.
- You are building systems with high availability and scalability requirements.

### Pseudocode Implementation

Let's delve into a pseudocode example to illustrate the Event Sourcing Pattern. We'll simulate a simple banking system where transactions are recorded as events.

#### Step 1: Define Events

```pseudocode
// Define a base Event class
class Event {
    timestamp: DateTime
    data: Map<String, Any>
}

// Define specific events
class DepositEvent extends Event {
    amount: Decimal
}

class WithdrawEvent extends Event {
    amount: Decimal
}
```

#### Step 2: Create an Event Store

```pseudocode
class EventStore {
    events: List<Event> = []

    function append(event: Event) {
        events.add(event)
    }

    function getEvents(): List<Event> {
        return events
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement Aggregates

```pseudocode
class Account {
    balance: Decimal = 0
    eventStore: EventStore

    function apply(event: Event) {
        if event is DepositEvent {
            balance += event.amount
        } else if event is WithdrawEvent {
            balance -= event.amount
        }
    }

    function deposit(amount: Decimal) {
        let event = new DepositEvent(amount: amount, timestamp: now())
        eventStore.append(event)
        apply(event)
    }

    function withdraw(amount: Decimal) {
        let event = new WithdrawEvent(amount: amount, timestamp: now())
        eventStore.append(event)
        apply(event)
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Reconstruct State

```pseudocode
function reconstructAccount(eventStore: EventStore): Account {
    let account = new Account(eventStore: eventStore)
    for event in eventStore.getEvents() {
        account.apply(event)
    }
    return account
}
```

### Visualizing Event Sourcing

To better understand the flow of events and state changes, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Account
    participant EventStore

    User->>Account: deposit(100)
    Account->>EventStore: append(DepositEvent)
    Account->>Account: apply(DepositEvent)

    User->>Account: withdraw(50)
    Account->>EventStore: append(WithdrawEvent)
    Account->>Account: apply(WithdrawEvent)

    User->>Account: reconstruct()
    loop For each event
        EventStore->>Account: getEvents()
        Account->>Account: apply(Event)
    end
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Event Sourcing Pattern, consider the following:

- **Event Versioning**: As your application evolves, the structure of events may change. Implement versioning to handle different event formats.
- **Performance**: Replaying events can be resource-intensive. Consider using snapshots to store intermediate states and reduce the number of events to replay.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that events are applied in the correct order to maintain consistency.
- **Scalability**: Design your event store to handle large volumes of events efficiently.

### Differences and Similarities

Event Sourcing is often compared to the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern. While both patterns can be used together, they serve different purposes. Event Sourcing focuses on capturing state changes, whereas CQRS separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the pseudocode examples:

1. **Add a new event type**: Implement a `TransferEvent` to handle transfers between accounts.
2. **Implement snapshots**: Create a mechanism to periodically save the account state to reduce the number of events to replay.
3. **Handle event versioning**: Introduce a versioning system to manage changes in event structure over time.
