## 6.2. Active Object Pattern

In the realm of concurrent programming, managing the execution of multiple tasks while maintaining system responsiveness is a critical challenge. The Active Object Pattern is a powerful concurrency design pattern that addresses this challenge by decoupling method execution from method invocation. This pattern allows for asynchronous method execution, enabling systems to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the caller.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Active Object Pattern is to enhance system responsiveness and manage concurrent tasks effectively. By decoupling method execution from invocation, this pattern allows for asynchronous processing, which is crucial in environments where tasks may take varying amounts of time to complete.

#### Key Benefits

- **Improved Responsiveness:** By executing methods asynchronously, the system remains responsive to new requests even when processing long-running tasks.
- **Concurrency Management:** The pattern provides a structured approach to managing concurrent tasks, reducing the complexity associated with multithreading.
- **Decoupling Execution:** Separates the concerns of method invocation and execution, allowing for more flexible and maintainable code.

### Key Participants

The Active Object Pattern involves several key participants, each playing a crucial role in the pattern's implementation:

- **Proxy:** Provides an interface for clients to interact with the active object. It handles method invocation requests and forwards them to the scheduler.
- **Scheduler:** Manages the execution of method requests, ensuring they are processed in a controlled manner.
- **Servant:** The actual object that performs the requested operations.
- **Future:** Represents the result of an asynchronous operation, allowing clients to retrieve the result once it is available.
- **Method Request:** Encapsulates a method call, including the method to be executed and its parameters.

### Applicability

The Active Object Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:

- **Asynchronous Processing is Required:** Tasks need to be executed without blocking the caller, such as in GUI applications or network servers.
- **Complex Concurrency Management:** The system needs to manage multiple concurrent tasks efficiently.
- **Decoupling of Concerns:** There is a need to separate method invocation from execution, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation

Let's delve into a pseudocode implementation of the Active Object Pattern, illustrating how the various components interact to achieve asynchronous method execution.

```pseudocode
// Define the MethodRequest class
class MethodRequest {
    method: Function
    parameters: List
    future: Future

    // Constructor
    MethodRequest(method, parameters, future) {
        this.method = method
        this.parameters = parameters
        this.future = future
    }

    // Execute the method and set the result in the future
    execute() {
        result = this.method.apply(null, this.parameters)
        this.future.setResult(result)
    }
}

// Define the Future class
class Future {
    result: Any
    isCompleted: Boolean = false

    // Set the result of the future
    setResult(result) {
        this.result = result
        this.isCompleted = true
    }

    // Get the result of the future
    getResult() {
        while (!this.isCompleted) {
            wait() // Wait until the result is available
        }
        return this.result
    }
}

// Define the Scheduler class
class Scheduler {
    queue: Queue = new Queue()

    // Add a method request to the queue
    enqueue(request: MethodRequest) {
        this.queue.enqueue(request)
    }

    // Process method requests from the queue
    processRequests() {
        while (true) {
            if (!this.queue.isEmpty()) {
                request = this.queue.dequeue()
                request.execute()
            }
        }
    }
}

// Define the Proxy class
class Proxy {
    scheduler: Scheduler
    servant: Servant

    // Constructor
    Proxy(scheduler, servant) {
        this.scheduler = scheduler
        this.servant = servant
    }

    // Invoke a method asynchronously
    invoke(method: Function, parameters: List): Future {
        future = new Future()
        request = new MethodRequest(method.bind(this.servant), parameters, future)
        this.scheduler.enqueue(request)
        return future
    }
}

// Define the Servant class
class Servant {
    // Example method
    compute(data: Any): Any {
        // Perform some computation
        return data * 2
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate the Active Object Pattern
function main() {
    servant = new Servant()
    scheduler = new Scheduler()
    proxy = new Proxy(scheduler, servant)

    // Start the scheduler in a separate thread
    startThread(() => scheduler.processRequests())

    // Invoke methods asynchronously
    future1 = proxy.invoke(servant.compute, [10])
    future2 = proxy.invoke(servant.compute, [20])

    // Retrieve results
    result1 = future1.getResult()
    result2 = future2.getResult()

    print("Result 1: " + result1)
    print("Result 2: " + result2)
}
```

### Diagram: Visualizing the Active Object Pattern

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between the components of the Active Object Pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy
    participant Scheduler
    participant Servant
    participant Future

    Client ->> Proxy: invoke(compute, [10])
    Proxy ->> Scheduler: enqueue(MethodRequest)
    Scheduler ->> Servant: execute(compute, [10])
    Servant -->> Scheduler: return result
    Scheduler ->> Future: setResult(result)
    Client ->> Future: getResult()
    Future -->> Client: return result
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Active Object Pattern, consider the following:

- **Thread Management:** Ensure that the scheduler runs in a separate thread to process method requests concurrently.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage exceptions that may occur during method execution.
- **Performance:** Monitor the performance of the system to ensure that the overhead of managing method requests does not outweigh the benefits of asynchronous execution.

### Differences and Similarities

The Active Object Pattern is often compared to other concurrency patterns, such as the **Future Pattern** and **Command Pattern**. While these patterns share similarities, they differ in their focus and implementation:

- **Future Pattern:** Primarily focuses on representing the result of an asynchronous operation, whereas the Active Object Pattern encompasses the entire process of method invocation and execution.
- **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, similar to the Method Request in the Active Object Pattern, but does not inherently manage concurrency.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Active Object Pattern, try modifying the pseudocode example:

- **Add New Methods:** Implement additional methods in the `Servant` class and invoke them asynchronously.
- **Enhance Error Handling:** Introduce error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions during method execution.
- **Optimize Performance:** Experiment with different queue management strategies in the `Scheduler` to optimize performance.
