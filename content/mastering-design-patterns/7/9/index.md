## 7.9. Recursion Patterns

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming, allowing functions to call themselves to solve problems. This section delves into recursion patterns, focusing on structural, generative, and tail recursion. We will explore how these patterns work, their applications, and strategies to avoid common pitfalls like stack overflows.

### Understanding Recursion

Recursion involves a function calling itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It is a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Recursion is often used in algorithms for tasks such as searching, sorting, and traversing data structures like trees and graphs.

#### Key Concepts

- **Base Case:** The condition under which the recursive function stops calling itself. It prevents infinite recursion and eventual stack overflow.
- **Recursive Case:** The part of the function where the recursion occurs, typically involving a call to the function itself with modified arguments.
- **Stack Overflow:** An error that occurs when the call stack memory is exhausted, often due to excessive recursion without a proper base case.

### Structural Recursion

Structural recursion is a pattern where the recursive function's structure mirrors the data structure it operates on. This pattern is common in operations on lists, trees, and other hierarchical data structures.

#### Example: List Sum

Consider a function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers using structural recursion:

```pseudocode
function sumList(numbers):
    if numbers is empty:
        return 0
    else:
        return head(numbers) + sumList(tail(numbers))
```

- **Base Case:** When the list is empty, the sum is 0.
- **Recursive Case:** Add the head of the list to the sum of the rest of the list.

#### Visualizing Structural Recursion

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[sumList([1, 2, 3])] --> B[1 + sumList([2, 3])]
    B --> C[2 + sumList([3])]
    C --> D[3 + sumList([])]
    D --> E[0]
```

**Diagram Explanation:** This flowchart illustrates the recursive calls made by the `sumList` function, showing how the function breaks down the list into smaller parts until reaching the base case.

### Generative Recursion

Generative recursion differs from structural recursion in that the recursive calls do not necessarily mirror the structure of the input data. Instead, the recursion generates new data or problems to solve.

#### Example: Quicksort Algorithm

Quicksort is a classic example of generative recursion:

```pseudocode
function quicksort(list):
    if length(list) <= 1:
        return list
    else:
        pivot = choosePivot(list)
        less = filter(x -> x < pivot, list)
        greater = filter(x -> x > pivot, list)
        return concatenate(quicksort(less), [pivot], quicksort(greater))
```

- **Base Case:** A list with one or zero elements is already sorted.
- **Recursive Case:** The list is divided into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and each sublist is sorted recursively.

#### Visualizing Generative Recursion

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[quicksort([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6])] --> B[quicksort([1, 1, 2])]
    A --> C[quicksort([4, 5, 9, 6])]
    B --> D[quicksort([])]
    B --> E[quicksort([1])]
    B --> F[quicksort([2])]
    C --> G[quicksort([4])]
    C --> H[quicksort([5, 9, 6])]
    H --> I[quicksort([5, 6])]
    H --> J[quicksort([9])]
```

**Diagram Explanation:** This diagram shows how the quicksort algorithm recursively sorts sublists, generating new subproblems at each step.

### Tail Recursion

Tail recursion is a special form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This allows some languages to optimize the recursion, preventing stack overflow by reusing the current function's stack frame.

#### Example: Tail Recursive Factorial

A tail-recursive version of the factorial function:

```pseudocode
function factorial(n, accumulator = 1):
    if n == 0:
        return accumulator
    else:
        return factorial(n - 1, n * accumulator)
```

- **Base Case:** When `n` is 0, return the accumulator.
- **Recursive Case:** Multiply the accumulator by `n` and decrement `n`.

#### Visualizing Tail Recursion

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[factorial(5, 1)] --> B[factorial(4, 5)]
    B --> C[factorial(3, 20)]
    C --> D[factorial(2, 60)]
    D --> E[factorial(1, 120)]
    E --> F[factorial(0, 120)]
    F --> G[120]
```

**Diagram Explanation:** This flowchart demonstrates how tail recursion accumulates the result in a single variable, allowing the function to complete without additional stack frames.

### Avoiding Stack Overflows

Stack overflows occur when the call stack is exhausted due to excessive recursion. Here are strategies to avoid them:

1. **Use Tail Recursion:** Tail recursion optimization (TRO) can prevent stack overflow by reusing the current stack frame.
2. **Iterative Solutions:** Convert recursive algorithms to iterative ones using loops, especially for problems with large input sizes.
3. **Limit Recursion Depth:** Set a maximum recursion depth and handle cases where this limit is exceeded.
4. **Optimize Base Cases:** Ensure base cases are reached efficiently to minimize recursive calls.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided:

- Modify the `sumList` function to handle lists of strings, concatenating them instead of summing numbers.
- Implement a tail-recursive version of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Convert the quicksort algorithm to an iterative version using a stack data structure.
