## 17.4. Case Studies with Pseudocode

In this section, we will delve into comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of design patterns across different programming paradigms. By examining these end-to-end examples, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of how design patterns can be effectively implemented using pseudocode. We will also reflect on the lessons learned from each case study, offering insights into best practices and common pitfalls.

### End-to-End Examples

#### Case Study 1: E-Commerce Platform

**Objective:** Design a scalable and maintainable e-commerce platform using a combination of creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Creational:** Factory Method, Singleton
- **Structural:** Composite, Decorator
- **Behavioral:** Observer, Strategy

**System Overview:**

The e-commerce platform consists of several components, including a product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and user notifications. The goal is to create a flexible system that can easily accommodate new product types, promotional strategies, and notification methods.

**Key Participants:**

- **ProductFactory:** Creates product objects.
- **Product:** Represents individual products.
- **Cart:** Manages products added by the user.
- **OrderProcessor:** Handles order processing logic.
- **NotificationService:** Sends notifications to users.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```pseudocode
// Factory Method for creating products
class ProductFactory {
    method createProduct(type) {
        if type == 'Book' then
            return new Book()
        else if type == 'Electronics' then
            return new Electronics()
        // Add more product types as needed
    }
}

// Singleton for managing cart
class Cart {
    private static instance = null
    private items = []

    private Cart() {}

    static method getInstance() {
        if instance == null then
            instance = new Cart()
        return instance
    }

    method addItem(product) {
        items.append(product)
    }

    method getItems() {
        return items
    }
}

// Composite pattern for order processing
class OrderProcessor {
    private components = []

    method addComponent(component) {
        components.append(component)
    }

    method processOrder() {
        for each component in components do
            component.execute()
    }
}

// Observer pattern for user notifications
class NotificationService {
    private observers = []

    method addObserver(observer) {
        observers.append(observer)
    }

    method notifyAll(message) {
        for each observer in observers do
            observer.update(message)
    }
}

// Strategy pattern for promotional discounts
class PromotionStrategy {
    method applyDiscount(cart) {
        // Default implementation
    }
}

class BlackFridayStrategy extends PromotionStrategy {
    method applyDiscount(cart) {
        // Apply Black Friday discount logic
    }
}
```

**Lessons Learned:**

- **Scalability:** Using the Factory Method pattern allows for easy addition of new product types without modifying existing code.
- **Maintainability:** The Singleton pattern ensures a single instance of the cart, simplifying state management.
- **Flexibility:** The Strategy pattern enables dynamic selection of promotional strategies, allowing for adaptable marketing campaigns.

```pseudocode
// Builder pattern for constructing messages
class MessageBuilder {
    private messageType
    private content
    private timestamp

    method setType(type) {
        messageType = type
        return this
    }

    method setContent(content) {
        content = content
        return this
    }

    method setTimestamp(timestamp) {
        timestamp = timestamp
        return this
    }

    method build() {
        return new Message(messageType, content, timestamp)
    }
}

// Adapter pattern for communication channels
class ChannelAdapter {
    private channel

    method ChannelAdapter(channel) {
        this.channel = channel
    }

    method sendMessage(message) {
        channel.send(message)
    }
}

// Proxy pattern for message services
class MessageProxy {
    private realService

    method MessageProxy(realService) {
        this.realService = realService
    }

    method send(message) {
        if checkAccess() then
            realService.send(message)
    }

    method checkAccess() {
        // Check user permissions
        return true
    }
}

// Mediator pattern for chat management
class ChatMediator {
    private users = []

    method addUser(user) {
        users.append(user)
    }

    method sendMessage(message, sender) {
        for each user in users do
            if user != sender then
                user.receive(message)
    }
}

// Command pattern for user actions
class SendMessageCommand {
    private receiver
    private message

    method SendMessageCommand(receiver, message) {
        this.receiver = receiver
        this.message = message
    }

    method execute() {
        receiver.sendMessage(message)
    }
}
```

**Lessons Learned:**

- **Interoperability:** The Adapter pattern facilitates integration with diverse communication channels, enhancing compatibility.
- **Security:** The Proxy pattern provides a layer of security, ensuring only authorized users can send messages.
- **Decoupling:** The Mediator pattern reduces direct dependencies between users, simplifying the communication logic.

- **ProductFlyweight:** Shares common product data.
- **RestockHandler:** Processes restocking requests.
- **StockState:** Manages product stock levels.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```pseudocode
// Prototype pattern for cloning products
class ProductPrototype {
    method clone() {
        return new Product(this.type, this.attributes)
    }
}

// Flyweight pattern for shared product data
class ProductFlyweight {
    private sharedData

    method ProductFlyweight(sharedData) {
        this.sharedData = sharedData
    }

    method getSharedData() {
        return sharedData
    }
}

// Chain of Responsibility for restocking
class RestockHandler {
    private nextHandler

    method setNext(handler) {
        nextHandler = handler
    }

    method handleRequest(request) {
        if canHandle(request) then
            // Process request
        else if nextHandler != null then
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request)
    }
}

// State pattern for stock management
class StockState {
    private state

    method setState(state) {
        this.state = state
    }

    method handle() {
        state.handle()
    }
}

class InStockState extends StockState {
    method handle() {
        // Logic for in-stock items
    }
}

class OutOfStockState extends StockState {
    method handle() {
        // Logic for out-of-stock items
    }
}
```

**Lessons Learned:**
