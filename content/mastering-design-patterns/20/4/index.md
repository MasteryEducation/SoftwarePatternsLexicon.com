### Visualizing Design Patterns

To enhance your understanding of design patterns, it's helpful to visualize their structures and interactions. Below are some examples of how to use Mermaid.js diagrams to represent design patterns:

#### Example: Singleton Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        - Singleton instance
        + getInstance() Singleton
    }
```

**Description:** This diagram illustrates the Singleton pattern, where a single instance of a class is created and accessed through a static method.

#### Example: Observer Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        + attach(Observer)
        + detach(Observer)
        + notify()
    }
    class Observer {
        + update()
    }
    Subject --> Observer
```

**Description:** This diagram represents the Observer pattern, where observers are notified of changes in the subject's state.

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding of design patterns, try implementing the following exercises:

1. **Modify the Singleton Pattern:**
   - Add a method to reset the Singleton instance and test its behavior.

2. **Implement the Observer Pattern:**
   - Create a simple weather station application where observers receive updates on temperature changes.
