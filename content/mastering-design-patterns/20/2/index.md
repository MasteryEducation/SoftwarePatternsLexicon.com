## 20.2. Design Pattern Reference Guide

Welcome to the Design Pattern Reference Guide, a comprehensive resource designed to provide expert developers with a concise overview of key design patterns. This guide includes the intent, applicability, and primary features of each pattern, along with visual diagrams and pseudocode examples. Let's delve into the world of design patterns and explore how they can enhance your software development practices.

### Singleton Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -Singleton instance
        -Singleton()
        +getInstance() Singleton
    }
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **Singleton**: Declares a static method for accessing the unique instance.

- **Applicability**:
  - Use when a single instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
  
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Ensure thread safety in multithreaded environments.
  - Be cautious of global state issues.

- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to global variables but provides controlled access.

### Factory Method Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Creator {
        +factoryMethod() Product
    }
    class ConcreteCreator {
        +factoryMethod() ConcreteProduct
    }
    class Product
    class ConcreteProduct
    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Product <|-- ConcreteProduct
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **Creator**: Declares the factory method.
  - **ConcreteCreator**: Overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.
  - **Product**: Defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
  - **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the Product interface.

- **Applicability**:
  - Use when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
  
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Often confused with Abstract Factory, but Factory Method uses inheritance while Abstract Factory uses composition.

### Abstract Factory Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractFactory {
        +createProductA() ProductA
        +createProductB() ProductB
    }
    class ConcreteFactory1 {
        +createProductA() ProductA1
        +createProductB() ProductB1
    }
    class ConcreteFactory2 {
        +createProductA() ProductA2
        +createProductB() ProductB2
    }
    class ProductA
    class ProductB
    class ProductA1
    class ProductB1
    class ProductA2
    class ProductB2
    AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory1
    AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory2
    ProductA <|-- ProductA1
    ProductA <|-- ProductA2
    ProductB <|-- ProductB1
    ProductB <|-- ProductB2
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **AbstractFactory**: Declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects.
  - **ConcreteFactory**: Implements the operations to create concrete product objects.
  - **Product**: Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding factory method.

- **Applicability**:
  - Use when the system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
  
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Adds a level of indirection that can make a system more configurable and extensible.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to Factory Method but focuses on creating families of objects.

### Builder Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Builder {
        +buildPart() void
    }
    class ConcreteBuilder {
        +buildPart() void
        +getResult() Product
    }
    class Director {
        +construct() void
    }
    class Product
    Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder
    Director --> Builder
    ConcreteBuilder --> Product
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **Builder**: Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.
  - **ConcreteBuilder**: Constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface.
  - **Director**: Constructs an object using the Builder interface.
  - **Product**: Represents the complex object under construction.

  - Use when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they are assembled.
  
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Facilitates the creation of complex objects by providing a step-by-step approach.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Often confused with Factory Method; however, Builder focuses on constructing a complex object step by step.

### Prototype Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Prototype {
        +clone() Prototype
    }
    class ConcretePrototype1 {
        +clone() ConcretePrototype1
    }
    class ConcretePrototype2 {
        +clone() ConcretePrototype2
    }
    Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype1
    Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype2
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **Prototype**: Declares an interface for cloning itself.
  - **ConcretePrototype**: Implements the operation for cloning itself.

- **Applicability**:
  - Use when a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
  
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Reduces the need for subclasses to create objects.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to Factory Method but uses cloning rather than instantiation.

### Adapter Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        +request() void
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request() void
    }

- **Design Considerations**:
  - Can be implemented as a class or an object adapter.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Often confused with Bridge; however, Adapter changes the interface of an existing object, while Bridge separates an abstraction from its implementation.

### Bridge Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Abstraction {
        +operation() void
    }
    class RefinedAbstraction {
        +operation() void
    }
    class Implementor {
        +operationImpl() void
    }
    class ConcreteImplementorA {
        +operationImpl() void
    }
    class ConcreteImplementorB {
        +operationImpl() void
    }
    Abstraction <|-- RefinedAbstraction
    RefinedAbstraction --> Implementor
    Implementor <|-- ConcreteImplementorA
    Implementor <|-- ConcreteImplementorB
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **Abstraction**: Defines the abstraction's interface.

  - Allows for flexibility and extensibility by separating abstraction and implementation.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Often confused with Adapter; however, Bridge is used to separate abstraction from implementation, while Adapter is used to change the interface of an existing object.

### Composite Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +operation() void
    }
    class Leaf {
        +operation() void
    }
    class Composite {
        +operation() void
        +add(Component) void
        +remove(Component) void

    }
    class SubsystemClass1 {
        +operation1() void
    }
    class SubsystemClass2 {
        +operation2() void
    }
    class SubsystemClass3 {
        +operation3() void

- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to Decorator but focuses on controlling access.

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Handler {
        +setSuccessor(Handler) void
        +handleRequest() void
    }
    class ConcreteHandler1 {
        +handleRequest() void

- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        +execute() void
    }
    class ConcreteCommand {
        +execute() void
    }
    class Invoker {
        +invoke() void
    }

- **Design Considerations**:
  - Supports undoable operations and logging changes.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to Strategy but focuses on encapsulating requests.

### Observer Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        +attach(Observer) void
        +detach(Observer) void
        +notify() void
    }
    class ConcreteSubject {
        +getState() State
        +setState(State) void
    }
    class Observer {
        +update() void
    }
    class ConcreteObserver {
        +update() void
    }
    Subject <|-- ConcreteSubject
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver
    Subject --> Observer
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **Subject**: Knows its observers and provides an interface for attaching and detaching observers.
  - **ConcreteSubject**: Stores state of interest to ConcreteObserver objects.
  - **Observer**: Defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a subject.

- **Design Considerations**:
  - Promotes loose coupling between the subject and its observers.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to Mediator but focuses on notifying dependents of state changes.

### Strategy Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        +setStrategy(Strategy) void
        +executeStrategy() void
    }
    class Strategy {
        +algorithmInterface() void
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        +algorithmInterface() void
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        +algorithmInterface() void
    }
    Context --> Strategy
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
```

- **Key Participants**:

- **Design Considerations**:
  - Promotes the use of composition over inheritance.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to State but focuses on interchangeable algorithms.

### Template Method Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractClass {
        +templateMethod() void
        +primitiveOperation1() void
        +primitiveOperation2() void
    }
    class ConcreteClass {
        +primitiveOperation1() void
        +primitiveOperation2() void
    }
    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClass
```

- **Key Participants**:
  - **AbstractClass**: Defines abstract primitive operations that concrete subclasses define to implement steps of an algorithm.
  - **ConcreteClass**: Implements the primitive operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm.

- **Applicability**:
  - Use to implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once and leave it up to subclasses to implement the behavior that can vary.
  
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Promotes code reuse and enforces a consistent algorithm structure.
  
- **Differences and Similarities**:
  - Similar to Strategy but focuses on a fixed algorithm structure.
