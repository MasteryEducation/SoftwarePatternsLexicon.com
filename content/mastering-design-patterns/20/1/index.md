## 20.1. Glossary of Terms

Welcome to the glossary section of "Mastering Design Patterns: A Comprehensive Guide Using Pseudocode Across Programming Paradigms." This glossary is designed to provide you with clear definitions of key concepts, acronyms, and jargon that are essential for understanding and applying design patterns across various programming paradigms. Whether you're an expert software engineer, architect, or developer, this glossary will serve as a valuable reference to enhance your understanding of the material covered in this guide.

### A

**Abstraction**  
Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows developers to focus on interactions at a higher level without worrying about the underlying details. In object-oriented programming, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

**Adapter Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by wrapping one of the interfaces to make it compatible with the other.

**Agile Development**  
A methodology for software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile development focuses on iterative progress through small, manageable increments.

### B

**Behavioral Design Patterns**  
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help in defining how objects interact in a system and how responsibilities are distributed.

**Bridge Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is useful when both the abstraction and its implementation need to be extended using inheritance.

**Builder Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. The pattern provides a way to construct a complex object by specifying its type and content, allowing for more control over the construction process.

### C

**Class Diagram**  
A type of static structure diagram in UML that describes the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, operations, and the relationships among objects.

**Composite Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**Concurrency**  
The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Concurrency is a key concept in modern computing, allowing for more efficient use of resources and improved performance.

**Creational Design Patterns**  
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help in abstracting the instantiation process, making a system independent of how its objects are created.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
A pattern that separates the read and write operations for a data store. It allows for more flexible and scalable architectures by optimizing the way data is handled for different operations.

### D

**Decorator Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

**Dependency Injection (DI)**  
A design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class through various means.

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
An approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**  
A principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing them with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

### E

**Encapsulation**  
A fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that restricts access to certain components of an object and can prevent the accidental modification of data.

**Entity**  
In Domain-Driven Design, an entity is an object that is defined by its identity rather than its attributes. Entities are often used to represent things that have a distinct lifecycle.

**Event Sourcing**  
A pattern in which state changes are stored as a sequence of events. This allows for the reconstruction of past states and provides a reliable audit trail.

**Evolutionary Prototyping**  
A type of prototyping where the prototype is continuously refined and evolved into the final product. It allows for feedback and iterative improvements throughout the development process.

### F

**Facade Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface that is easier to use.

**Factory Method Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. It allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.

**Functional Programming (FP)**  
A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. It emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutability.

**Flyweight Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows for the sharing of objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. It reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects.

### G

**Gang of Four (GoF)**  
Refers to the authors of the seminal book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," which introduced 23 classic design patterns. The authors are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

**Generics**  
A feature of programming languages that allows you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for the type of data they store or use. Generics enable type-safe data structures and algorithms.

**GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)**  
A set of principles for assigning responsibilities to classes and objects in object-oriented design. GRASP helps in creating a robust and maintainable design.

### H

**High Cohesion**  
A design principle that suggests that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility. High cohesion is desirable as it leads to more understandable and maintainable code.

**Higher-Order Functions**  
Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are a key feature of functional programming and enable powerful abstractions and code reuse.

**Hook Method**  
A method that is intended to be overridden by subclasses to extend or modify the behavior of a template method. Hook methods are often used in the Template Method pattern.

### I

**Immutability**  
A property of an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. Immutable objects are a core concept in functional programming and help in avoiding side effects.

**Inversion of Control (IoC)**  
A design principle in which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. Dependency Injection is a common implementation of IoC.

**Iterator Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### J

**Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)**  
A technique used in programming languages to improve performance by compiling code into machine language at runtime, rather than prior to execution.

The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Normalization involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables.

**Null Object Pattern**  
A design pattern that uses a special object to represent the absence of an object. It avoids null references by providing a default behavior.

**Namespace**  
A container that holds a set of identifiers and allows the organization of code elements into groups. Namespaces help avoid naming conflicts in large programs.

### O

### T

**Template Method Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first, the developer writes an initially failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

**Thread Pool**  
A collection of threads that can be reused to perform multiple tasks. Thread pools help in managing a large number of threads efficiently.

A standardized modeling language that provides a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems.

**Unit Testing**  
A level of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected.

**User Interface (UI)**  
The space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, while the machine simultaneously provides feedback that aids the operators' decision-making process.

### V

**Value Object**  
An object that contains attributes but has no conceptual identity. They are used to describe aspects of a domain and are immutable.

**Visitor Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures.

**Version Control System (VCS)**  
A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Examples include Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

### W
