## 10.9. Routing Slip Pattern

In the realm of enterprise integration, the **Routing Slip Pattern** emerges as a powerful solution for defining dynamic routing paths and implementing processing sequences. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where messages or tasks need to be processed by a series of components, each performing a specific function, and where the sequence of these components can vary based on the message content or other criteria.

### Design Pattern Name

**Routing Slip Pattern**

### Category

**Enterprise Integration Patterns**

### Intent

The intent of the Routing Slip Pattern is to enable dynamic and flexible routing of messages or tasks through a series of processing steps. Each step in the sequence is determined at runtime, allowing for adaptable workflows that can change based on the context or content of the message.

### Key Participants

1. **Message**: The data or task that needs to be processed.
2. **Routing Slip**: A list or sequence of processing steps that the message must follow.
3. **Processor**: A component that performs a specific operation on the message.
4. **Router**: The mechanism that reads the routing slip and directs the message to the appropriate processor.

### Applicability

The Routing Slip Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- The processing sequence of a message can vary based on its content or external conditions.
- There is a need for flexible and dynamic workflows.
- The system must support complex routing logic without hardcoding the paths.

### Sample Code Snippets

Let's dive into some pseudocode examples to illustrate the Routing Slip Pattern. We'll start by defining the basic components: the message, routing slip, and processors.

```pseudocode
// Define a Message class
class Message {
    data: Any
    routingSlip: List<String>
}

// Define a Processor interface
interface Processor {
    process(message: Message): void
}

// Define a Router class
class Router {
    processors: Map<String, Processor>

    route(message: Message): void {
        while not message.routingSlip.isEmpty() {
            step = message.routingSlip.removeFirst()
            processor = processors.get(step)
            if processor is not null {
                processor.process(message)
            } else {
                print("No processor found for step: " + step)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this pseudocode, we define a `Message` class that contains the data to be processed and a `routingSlip`, which is a list of processing steps. The `Processor` interface defines a `process` method that each processor must implement. The `Router` class manages the routing of messages by reading the routing slip and directing the message to the appropriate processor.

### Implementing Processing Sequences

To implement processing sequences using the Routing Slip Pattern, we need to define specific processors and a mechanism to populate the routing slip based on the message content.

```pseudocode
// Define specific processors
class LoggingProcessor implements Processor {
    process(message: Message): void {
        print("Logging message: " + message.data)
    }
}

class ValidationProcessor implements Processor {
    process(message: Message): void {
        if isValid(message.data) {
            print("Message is valid")
        } else {
            print("Message is invalid")
        }
    }
}

// Example of setting up a routing slip
function setupRoutingSlip(message: Message): void {
    if message.data.contains("log") {
        message.routingSlip.add("LoggingProcessor")
    }
    if message.data.contains("validate") {
        message.routingSlip.add("ValidationProcessor")
    }
}

// Example usage
message = new Message(data: "log and validate this message")
setupRoutingSlip(message)

router = new Router(processors: {
    "LoggingProcessor": new LoggingProcessor(),
    "ValidationProcessor": new ValidationProcessor()
})

router.route(message)
```

In this example, we define two specific processors: `LoggingProcessor` and `ValidationProcessor`. We also provide a `setupRoutingSlip` function that populates the routing slip based on the message content. The `Router` then processes the message according to the routing slip.

### Visualizing the Routing Slip Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Routing Slip Pattern, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Message
    participant R as Router
    participant P1 as LoggingProcessor
    participant P2 as ValidationProcessor

    M->>R: Send message with routing slip
    loop Process each step
        R->>P1: Route to LoggingProcessor
        P1-->>R: Processed
        R->>P2: Route to ValidationProcessor
        P2-->>R: Processed
    end
    R-->>M: Processing complete
```

**Figure 1: Sequence Diagram of the Routing Slip Pattern**

This diagram illustrates the flow of a message through the routing slip. The message is sent to the router, which processes each step in the routing slip by directing the message to the appropriate processor.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Routing Slip Pattern, consider the following:

- **Error Handling**: Ensure that the system can handle errors gracefully, such as when a processor is not found or when processing fails.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of dynamic routing, especially in high-throughput systems.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale horizontally by distributing processors across multiple nodes or services.
- **Security**: Ensure that the routing slip cannot be tampered with, as this could lead to unauthorized processing steps.

### Differences and Similarities

The Routing Slip Pattern is often compared to the **Process Manager Pattern**. While both patterns involve directing messages through a series of processing steps, the Routing Slip Pattern focuses on dynamic routing based on the message content, whereas the Process Manager Pattern typically involves more complex state management and orchestration.

### Try It Yourself

To gain a deeper understanding of the Routing Slip Pattern, try modifying the pseudocode examples:

- Add new processors that perform different operations on the message.
- Implement conditional logic in the `setupRoutingSlip` function to create more complex routing paths.
- Experiment with error handling by introducing scenarios where a processor might fail.
