## 10.5. Content-Based Router

In the realm of enterprise integration patterns, the **Content-Based Router** plays a pivotal role in directing messages to different destinations based on their content. This pattern is essential for systems that require dynamic message routing, allowing for flexible and scalable integration solutions. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of the Content-Based Router, exploring its intent, applicability, and implementation through pseudocode examples.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Content-Based Router is to route messages to different channels or destinations based on the content of the message itself. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where messages need to be processed differently depending on their type, source, or other attributes.

### Key Participants

1. **Message**: The data or information that needs to be routed.
2. **Router**: The component that examines the message content and determines the appropriate destination.
3. **Destination Channels**: The various endpoints or channels where messages can be sent.

### Applicability

The Content-Based Router is applicable in situations where:

- Messages need to be processed differently based on their content.
- The system architecture requires flexibility to add or change routing logic without significant modifications.
- There is a need to decouple message producers from message consumers, allowing for independent evolution.

### Diagrams

To better understand the flow of a Content-Based Router, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Message Producer] -->|Send Message| B[Content-Based Router];
    B -->|Route based on Content| C[Destination 1];
    B -->|Route based on Content| D[Destination 2];
    B -->|Route based on Content| E[Destination 3];
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram illustrates a message producer sending a message to the Content-Based Router. The router examines the message content and routes it to one of several destinations based on predefined criteria.

### Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a pseudocode implementation of a Content-Based Router. This example will demonstrate how to dynamically route messages based on their content.

```pseudocode
// Define a Message class
class Message:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.content = content

// Define a Router class
class ContentBasedRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.routes = []

    // Method to add a route with a condition and a destination
    def add_route(self, condition, destination):
        self.routes.append((condition, destination))

    // Method to route a message based on its content
    def route_message(self, message):
        for condition, destination in self.routes:
            if condition(message.content):
                destination.receive(message)
                break

// Define a Destination class
class Destination:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def receive(self, message):
        print(f"Message received at {self.name}: {message.content}")

// Example usage
def main():
    # Create destinations
    destination1 = Destination("Destination 1")
    destination2 = Destination("Destination 2")
    destination3 = Destination("Destination 3")

    # Create a content-based router
    router = ContentBasedRouter()

    # Add routes with conditions
    router.add_route(lambda content: "urgent" in content, destination1)
    router.add_route(lambda content: "info" in content, destination2)
    router.add_route(lambda content: "error" in content, destination3)

    # Create messages
    message1 = Message("urgent: server down")
    message2 = Message("info: daily report")
    message3 = Message("error: disk full")

    # Route messages
    router.route_message(message1)
    router.route_message(message2)
    router.route_message(message3)

main()
```

**Pseudocode Explanation**: In this pseudocode, we define a `Message` class to encapsulate the message content. The `ContentBasedRouter` class manages routing logic, allowing routes to be added with specific conditions and destinations. The `Destination` class represents endpoints that can receive messages. The example demonstrates routing messages based on keywords in their content.

### Design Considerations

When implementing a Content-Based Router, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Evaluate the performance impact of routing logic, especially if conditions are complex or numerous.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the router can handle an increasing number of routes and messages efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Design the router to accommodate changes in routing logic without significant refactoring.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage routing failures or invalid message content.

### Differences and Similarities

The Content-Based Router is often compared to the **Message Filter** pattern. While both deal with message content, the Message Filter pattern is primarily concerned with filtering out unwanted messages, whereas the Content-Based Router focuses on directing messages to appropriate destinations.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Content-Based Router, try modifying the pseudocode example:

- Add additional conditions and destinations to the router.
- Implement a fallback destination for messages that don't match any condition.
- Experiment with more complex conditions, such as regular expressions or content parsing.

### Visualizing Dynamic Message Routing

To further illustrate the concept of dynamic message routing, consider the following sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant Router
    participant Destination1
    participant Destination2
    participant Destination3

    Producer->>Router: Send Message
    alt Message contains "urgent"
        Router->>Destination1: Route to Destination 1
    else Message contains "info"
        Router->>Destination2: Route to Destination 2
    else Message contains "error"
        Router->>Destination3: Route to Destination 3
    end
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram shows the interaction between a message producer, a content-based router, and multiple destinations. The router evaluates the message content and routes it to the appropriate destination based on predefined conditions.
