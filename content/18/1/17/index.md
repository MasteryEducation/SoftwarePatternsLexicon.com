## Overview of Event-Driven Infrastructure Changes

In modern cloud environments, the ability to dynamically respond to various triggers is a key enabler for agility and responsiveness. The **Event-Driven Infrastructure Changes** design pattern outlines a framework for implementing infrastructure updates automatically in response to events. These events may include changes in application state, system load metrics, external stimuli, or manual requests. This pattern facilitates automated scaling, configuration adjustments, security enhancements, or optimized resource allocation.

## Architectural Approach

To implement event-driven infrastructure changes, the following architectural components and steps are typically involved:

1. **Event Source Identification**: Determine the types of events or triggers that necessitate infrastructure changes. Common sources include application logs, monitoring systems, user interactions, and external API calls.

2. **Event Processing Pipeline**: Establish a pipeline capable of capturing, filtering, and processing events. Technologies commonly used include cloud-native solutions such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.

3. **Infrastructure Management Logic**: Define the logic for assessing event data and deciding the appropriate infrastructure actions. This logic can be encapsulated in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates using tools such as Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager Templates.

4. **Execution and Orchestration**: Utilize orchestration tools and services, like Kubernetes and its operator pattern, to apply the necessary infrastructure changes automatically.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Set up monitoring to track the impact of changes and ensure they produce the desired outcomes. Gather feedback for iterative improvements and error handling.

## Example Implementation

Consider a scenario where an e-commerce platform experiences high variability in traffic. To efficiently manage resources while maintaining performance, the platform may implement event-driven infrastructure scaling. Here's a brief overview in pseudocode:

```pseudo
listen to traffic spikes on cloud monitoring

if traffic > threshold
    deploy additional server instances using IaC
else if traffic < lower-threshold
    remove excess server instances
```

For AWS, one could use AWS Lambda to trigger adjustments to an Auto Scaling Group based on CloudWatch events:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    autoscaling = boto3.client('autoscaling')

    scaling_policy = determine_scaling_policy(event)

    # Modifying the scaling group based on the policy decision
    response = autoscaling.set_desired_capacity(
        AutoScalingGroupName='my-autoscaling-group',
        DesiredCapacity=scaling_policy
    )
```

## Related Patterns

- **Reactive Microservices**: Design pattern where microservices react to changes in state, events, or messages, promoting loose coupling and scalability.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use of machine-readable definition files that describe infrastructure components, ensuring consistent and repeatable environments.
- **Serverless Architectures**: Systems that automatically scale based on demand and don't require provisioning of servers, commonly associated with event-driven design.

## Summary

The Event-Driven Infrastructure Changes design pattern provides a scalable and agile approach to managing cloud infrastructure. By enabling infrastructure to react automatically to certain events or changes in conditions, organizations can achieve better resource utilization, ensure high availability, and reduce manual intervention. Implementing this pattern involves establishing a robust event processing pipeline, crafting precise infrastructure management logic, and continuously monitoring outcomes for iterative enhancement.
