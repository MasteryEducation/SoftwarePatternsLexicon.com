Progressive Delivery is an advanced software development discipline that encompasses practices, technologies, and tools used to safely and efficiently deploy and release changes to a live system. It represents an evolution from traditional deployment techniques to more iterative and incremental methods, ensuring a higher degree of control and focus on continuous improvement.

## Detailed Explanation

Progressive Delivery Techniques integrate several methodologies in cloud computing applications, enabling development and operations teams to perform smoother, more controlled releases. These techniques are designed to minimize risk and encompass implementing feature flags, canary releases, and blue-green deployments. Here's an in-depth look into each one:

### 1. Feature Flags

Feature flags involve using software toggles to enable or disable features dynamically without deploying new code. They allow development teams to release a version of a system with all features turned off by default and then gradually turn each one on.

**Benefits:**
- **Rapid Iteration:** Quickly test features in production without redeploying.
- **A/B Testing:** Conduct split testing by enabling features for certain user demographics.
- **Rollback Capabilities:** Instantly roll back features by toggling off the flag.

### 2. Canary Releases

A canary release gradually introduces a new software version to a small subset of users before a full rollout, acting as a ‘canary in a coal mine’ to detect issues early.

**Benefits:**
- **Safe Monitoring:** Spot potential issues in a controlled environment, minimizing risk.
- **User Feedback:** Obtain real-world user feedback on new features for improvements.
- **Performance Analysis:** Analyze system behavior under progressive load.

### Example Implementation in Kubernetes with YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-canary
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        track: canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp-container
        image: myapp:canary-version
```

### 3. Blue-Green Deployments

This approach involves running two identical production environments, known as Blue and Green. At any given time, one environment is live, while the other is idle or used for testing the new release.

**Benefits:**
- **Zero Downtime Releases:** Switching traffic to new environments ensures a seamless transition.
- **Instant Rollbacks:** Should issues arise, revert to the previous environment effortlessly.
- **High Availability:** Assures availability and continuity during deployment cycles.

## Architectural Approaches and Paradigms

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Progressive delivery is often an extension of CI/CD methodologies, advancing these practices into production environments and promoting a culture of risk management and improvement.

### Immutable Infrastructure

Tightly coupled with progressive delivery is impressive infrastructure, which states that servers should never be modified but instead replaced with new versions, further supporting techniques like blue-green deployments.

## Best Practices

1. **Automate Feature Flags:** Integrate automation where possible to ensure flag consistency and reduce manual errors.
2. **Monitor Deployments Continuously:** Use robust monitoring and logging tools to detect issues rapidly during a gradual rollout.
3. **Have a Clear Rollback Strategy:** Ensure mechanisms are in place for quick rollbacks if new code introduces critical issues.

## Related Patterns

- **Rollback Strategies:** Ensures effective rollbacks during production failures.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD):** Extends to progressive strategies for safer deployments.
- **Observability and Monitoring Patterns:** Crucial for effective implementation of progressive delivery.

## Final Summary

Progressive Delivery Techniques are essential in today's fast-paced software delivery environments. They ensure feature releases are conducted with minimal risk, a positive user experience, and give the ability to iterate quickly via feedback loops. Adopting these patterns integrates closely with modern DevOps practices and enhances overall team agility and response to user needs, shielding production environments from potentially catastrophic deployment failures.
