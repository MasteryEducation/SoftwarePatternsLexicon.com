## Overview

The Container Registry Use pattern is integral to modern cloud computing and container orchestration solutions. It provides a centralized repository for storing, managing, and distributing container images, such as Docker images or OCI-compliant images. Container registries are crucial in managing container lifecycles, versioning, and ensuring secure access to containerized applications, facilitating seamless deployment across various environments.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Centralized Storage

Container registries offer a unified location for storing container images, ensuring consistency and accessibility. By centralizing images, an organization can maintain a single source of truth for all containerized applications, reducing the complexity of managing images across distributed environments.

### 2. Image Versioning and Tagging

Container registries support image versioning and tagging, providing mechanisms to handle multiple versions of the same application efficiently. This is crucial for rolling updates, rollbacks, and managing different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, and production).

### 3. Security and Access Control

Modern container registries incorporate security features, including vulnerability scanning, access control, and encryption. By employing role-based access control (RBAC) and integrating with identity management systems, registries ensure that only authorized users and systems can push or pull images.

### 4. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

Container registries integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated builds, tests, and deployments. By pushing updated images to the registry as part of a continuous integration process, teams can automate the deployment of new features and updates to production environments.

## Example Code

Below is an example of a Dockerfile that builds an application image, which you can then push to a container registry:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/my-application.jar /app/my-application.jar

CMD ["java", "-jar", "my-application.jar"]
```

Once built, the image can be tagged and pushed to a container registry:

```bash
docker build -t my-application:1.0 .

docker tag my-application:1.0 registry.example.com/my-application:1.0

docker push registry.example.com/my-application:1.0
```

## Related Patterns

### 1. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

This pattern involves automatic integration of code changes from multiple contributors and automated deployment processes. The container registry serves as a critical artifact repository in this pipeline.

### 2. **Immutable Infrastructure**

Container registries facilitate the creation of immutable infrastructure by storing versioned and immutable container images that are deployed precisely as they are built.

### 3. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**

Together with a container orchestrator like Kubernetes, container registries enable dynamic service discovery and load balancing by ensuring the latest container images are available for deployment.

## Summary

The Container Registry Use pattern is a cornerstone of cloud-native application deployment. By leveraging container registries, organizations simplify the management of container images, ensure secure and efficient distribution, and integrate seamlessly with modern DevOps practices. Whether for simple applications or complex microservice architectures, container registries play a pivotal role in the lifecycle of containerized applications.
