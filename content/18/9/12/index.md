## Introduction to Function Versioning

In serverless computing, **Function Versioning** refers to the practice of maintaining multiple versions of cloud functions. This pattern is essential for evolving applications safely and ensuring that updates or changes to functions do not disrupt the existing systems. It allows developers to deploy new versions incrementally, perform A/B testing, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

Function Versioning is widely used in platforms such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, where version management tools are built into the platform. It is a best practice that contributes to the robustness and reliability of serverless applications.

## Pattern Explanation

- **Versioning:** Different iterations of a function are managed as separate versions. This allows older versions to remain operational while new features are being developed or tested.

- **Deployment Strategy:** New versions can be deployed without immediately affecting the production environment. This is often done through aliasing, where an alias (e.g., "latest") points to a specific version.

- **Rollback Capability:** In case a new version has issues, it can be replaced quickly with a previous stable version without downtime, ensuring business continuity.

- **Traffic Shifting:** Some platforms offer the ability to shift a percentage of traffic to a new version. This allows you to perform canary or A/B tests, gradually sending more traffic to the new version if it performs as expected.

## Best Practices

- **Use Aliases:** Assign aliases to versions to simplify deployments and rollbacks. For example, you could have aliases such as "prod" for production versions and "beta" for versions in testing.

- **Automate Version Management:** Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and versioning of serverless functions. Tools like AWS CodePipeline or Azure DevOps can help streamline this process.

- **Test Extensively:** Conduct sufficient testing on new versions in isolated environments before assigning production traffic.

- **Monitor and Analyze Performance:** Use logging and monitoring tools to track the performance and health of different function versions. Services such as AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor can be helpful.

## Example Code in AWS Lambda

Below is a basic example of how AWS Lambda function versioning can be managed:

```javascript
// handler.js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  // Business logic for version 1.0
  return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify('Hello from version 1.0!') };
};
```

After uploading the initial function code and testing it, you can publish it as version 1. Once you add features or fixes, publish it as a new version.

### Creating Versions and Aliases:

```bash
aws lambda create-function --function-name my-function --runtime nodejs18.x --handler handler.handler --zip-file fileb://function.zip --role arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/lambda-ex --publish

aws lambda update-function-code --function-name my-function --zip-file fileb://function.zip --publish

aws lambda create-alias --function-name my-function --name production --function-version new_version_number
```

## Related Patterns

- **Blue-Green Deployment:** A deployment strategy that has multiple environments (blue and green) to transition between old and new versions.
- **Canary Release:** Gradually shifting users to the new version by directing a small percentage of the traffic while the majority remains on the old version until the new version is deemed stable.

## Summary

Function Versioning is a crucial design pattern in serverless computing environments that ensures smooth transitions between different versions of a serverless function. It supports safe deployments, enables rollback capabilities, and facilitates experimentation through A/B testing and other methods. Utilizing versioning leads to more resilient serverless applications capable of evolving rapidly to meet new business requirements.
