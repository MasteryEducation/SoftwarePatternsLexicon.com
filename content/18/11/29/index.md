## Introduction

In modern software development, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for automating the testing, building, and deployment of applications. As organizations scale, maintaining consistency across these pipelines becomes challenging, especially when numerous projects require similar pipeline structures. The Pipeline Templates Reuse pattern addresses this challenge by allowing teams to define templates that encapsulate common pipeline logic, which can be reused and customized, reducing redundancy and enhancing efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Manually maintaining CI/CD pipelines for multiple projects can result in duplicated efforts, inconsistency, and a higher chance of errors. Each project often requires similar steps, such as checking out code, running tests, and deploying artifacts. Without a reusable mechanism, any change in the pipeline process requires repetition across all projects, complicating maintainability and scalability.

## Solution

The Pipeline Templates Reuse pattern introduces the concept of defining template pipelines that encapsulate common steps and logic. These templates can be parameterized and extended to suit specific project needs, thus promoting reuse and standardization.

### Key Components

- **Template Repositories:** A central location where standard pipeline templates are stored and managed.
- **Parameterization:** Templates can accept parameters to customize pipeline behavior without modifying the core template.
- **Inheritance and Overrides:** Projects can inherit from a base template and override specific steps as needed.
- **Shared Libraries and Utilities:** Functions and shared code that can be included in templates to further enhance reuse.

## Implementation

### Example: Jenkins Pipeline Template

In a scenario using Jenkins, a company could define a Jenkinsfile as a pipeline template:

```groovy
// Jenkinsfile Template
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'BRANCH_NAME', defaultValue: 'main', description: 'Branch to build')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm: [
                    $class: 'GitSCM', 
                    branches: [[name: "*/${params.BRANCH_NAME}"]], 
                    userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'git@github.com:company/repo.git']]
                ]
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Deployment steps
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            mail to: 'team@company.com',
                 subject: "Build ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
                 body: "Build details..."
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage in a Project

```groovy
// Jenkinsfile in a specific project using the template
@Library('pipeline-templates') _
def myPipeline = new JenkinsfileTemplate(params: [BRANCH_NAME: 'develop'])

myPipeline.run()
```

## Best Practices

- **Version Control:** Maintain versioning of pipeline templates to track changes and ensure backward compatibility.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document available templates and their parameters to facilitate adoption and use.
- **Testing:** Regularly test templates to ensure they meet the evolving needs of different projects.
- **Security:** Manage pipeline template access to prevent unauthorized modifications and ensure security compliance.

## Related Patterns

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Unify infrastructure and CI/CD management through code.
- **Microservices Deployment Patterns:** Tailor deployments to complex microservice architectures.
- **Feature Toggles:** Integrate feature management in CI/CD to control feature availability.

## Summary

The Pipeline Templates Reuse pattern is pivotal for organizations looking to streamline their CI/CD processes across various projects. By centralizing common pipeline logic into reusable templates, teams can achieve greater efficiency, reduce redundancy, and ensure consistency. Adopting this pattern leads to more maintainable and flexible CI/CD workflows, accommodating future scale and complexity with ease.
