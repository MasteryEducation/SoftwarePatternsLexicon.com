## Introduction

Security scanning in CI/CD pipelines is a critical pattern that empowers development teams to detect vulnerabilities and enforce security protocols early in the software delivery lifecycle. This pattern is integral to modern software development, particularly when dealing with cloud deployments where security threats are prevalent.

## Design Pattern Description

The Security Scanning in CI/CD pattern integrates security checks into the continuous integration and deployment processes. It automates the identification of security vulnerabilities, such as common coding errors, dependency issues, and configuration flaws, which could be exploited if not addressed promptly.

### Key Features

- **Automation**: Automates security scans as part of the build process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitLab CI.
- **Feedback Loop**: Provides immediate feedback to developers when vulnerabilities are detected, aiding quick remediation.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the cost of fixing vulnerabilities by catching them early in the development process.
- **Compliance**: Ensures that the code complies with relevant security standards and regulations.

## Architectural Approaches

### Tools and Technologies

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyzes source code for known vulnerabilities. Tools include SonarQube, Checkmarx, and Fortify.
2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Tests running applications from the outside to find vulnerabilities. Examples are OWASP Zap and Burp Suite.
3. **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Analyzes open source component usage for vulnerabilities. Tools like WhiteSource and Snyk are widely used.

### Integration Strategy

1. **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Implement security checks before code is committed to the repository.
2. **Build Stage**: Integrate security scanners in the build pipeline, ensuring that only secure artifacts are promoted to subsequent environments.
3. **Pre-Deployment**: Run DAST scans on staging environments to identify runtime security issues.

```yaml
stages:
  - stage: Static Code Analysis
    steps:
      - script: |
            checkmarx-scan --project=my-project --src=src/
      - script: |
            snyk test

  - stage: Run Unit Tests
    steps:
      ... 

  - stage: Dynamic Analyses
    steps:
      - script: |
            owasp-zap --scan http://staging.myapp.com
```

## Best Practices

- **Shift Left**: Incorporate security scanning as early as possible in the development process to identify issues before they propagate.
- **Fail Fast**: Configure pipelines to fail builds when critical vulnerabilities are found, preventing insecure code deployments.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously update and monitor scanning tools to keep up with emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Developer Training**: Educate development teams on security best practices to reduce vulnerability introduction.
- **Custom Rules**: Tailor security rulesets to align with the organization's specific security policies.

## Related Patterns

- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Building static environments to further reduce the attack surface.
- **Infrastructure as Code Security**: Extending security scanning to IaC scripts.
- **Secret Management**: Securing credentials and sensitive data used by applications.

## Summary

Integrating security scanning into your CI/CD pipelines is a critical step in adopting a DevSecOps culture, ensuring your applications are secure throughout their lifecycle. This pattern not only helps in identifying vulnerabilities early but also makes the security posture of your applications robust, reducing risks associated with cloud deployments. By leveraging automated tools and following best practices, organizations can efficiently enforce security measures without hindering development agility.
