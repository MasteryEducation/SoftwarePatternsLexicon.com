## 9.3 Fibers and Cooperative Concurrency

Concurrency is a crucial aspect of modern software development, enabling applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In Ruby, Fibers provide a unique approach to concurrency, known as cooperative concurrency. This section delves into the concept of Fibers, how they differ from Threads, and their practical applications in Ruby programming.

### Understanding Fibers

Fibers in Ruby are lightweight concurrency primitives that allow developers to manually control the execution of code blocks. Unlike Threads, which operate under a preemptive concurrency model, Fibers use cooperative concurrency. This means that the control of execution is explicitly managed by the programmer, allowing for more predictable and fine-grained control over task execution.

#### Fibers vs. Threads

- **Threads**: Threads in Ruby are part of the preemptive concurrency model, where the operating system scheduler decides when to switch between threads. This can lead to race conditions and requires careful management of shared resources.
- **Fibers**: Fibers, on the other hand, are part of the cooperative concurrency model. They do not run concurrently with each other; instead, they yield control back to the calling code, allowing the programmer to decide when to switch between tasks.

### Cooperative vs. Preemptive Concurrency

- **Cooperative Concurrency**: In cooperative concurrency, tasks voluntarily yield control, allowing other tasks to run. This model is simpler to reason about because the developer has explicit control over task switching.
- **Preemptive Concurrency**: In preemptive concurrency, the operating system or runtime environment decides when to switch between tasks, which can lead to more complex interactions and potential race conditions.

### Creating and Using Fibers

Let's explore how to create and use Fibers in Ruby. The `Fiber` class provides the necessary methods to define and manage fibers.

#### Creating a Fiber

To create a Fiber, use the `Fiber.new` method, passing a block of code that represents the task to be executed.

```ruby
fiber = Fiber.new do
  puts "Fiber started"
  Fiber.yield
  puts "Fiber resumed"
end
```

In this example, the fiber prints a message, yields control, and then resumes execution when explicitly instructed.

#### Resuming a Fiber

To resume a Fiber, use the `fiber.resume` method. This method continues the execution of the fiber from the point it yielded.

```ruby
fiber.resume
# Output: Fiber started

fiber.resume
# Output: Fiber resumed
```

The `Fiber.yield` method is used within the fiber to pause execution and return control to the calling code. The `fiber.resume` method is then used to continue execution from where it left off.

### Use Cases for Fibers

Fibers are particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be paused and resumed explicitly. Here are some common use cases:

- **IO-bound Applications**: Fibers can improve performance in IO-bound applications by allowing tasks to yield control while waiting for IO operations to complete, thus enabling other tasks to run.
- **Generators and Enumerators**: Fibers are used internally in Ruby to implement generators and enumerators, providing a way to iterate over data lazily.
- **Coroutines**: Fibers can be used to implement coroutines, which are general control structures that generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking.

### Limitations of Fibers

While Fibers offer several advantages, they also come with limitations:

- **Single-threaded Execution**: Fibers do not utilize multiple CPU cores, as they operate within a single thread. This makes them unsuitable for CPU-bound tasks that require parallel execution.
- **Manual Control**: The need for explicit control over task switching can lead to complex code if not managed carefully.

### Improving Performance with Fibers

In IO-bound applications, Fibers can significantly improve performance by allowing tasks to yield control during IO operations. This enables other tasks to execute while waiting for IO to complete, reducing idle time and increasing throughput.

### Enumerator and Generator

Ruby's Enumerator and Generator classes internally use Fibers to provide lazy iteration over collections. This allows developers to create custom iterators that yield values one at a time, improving memory efficiency and performance.

#### Example: Custom Enumerator with Fiber

```ruby
def custom_enumerator
  Fiber.new do
    (1..5).each do |i|
      Fiber.yield i
    end
  end
end

enumerator = custom_enumerator

5.times do
  puts enumerator.resume
end
```

In this example, a custom enumerator is created using a Fiber, yielding values from 1 to 5. The `Fiber.yield` method is used to pause execution and return each value to the calling code.

### Visualizing Fibers and Cooperative Concurrency

To better understand the flow of execution in Fibers, let's visualize the process using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main
    participant Fiber
    Main->>Fiber: Create Fiber
    Fiber-->>Main: Fiber started
    Main->>Fiber: Resume Fiber
    Fiber-->>Main: Fiber resumed
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the main program and a Fiber, highlighting the creation, yielding, and resumption of the Fiber.
