## 9.4 Ractors in Ruby 3 for Parallelism

Ruby 3 introduced a powerful new feature called Ractors, designed to enable true parallelism by running code across multiple CPU cores. This section will delve into the concept of Ractors, their purpose, and how they differ from traditional concurrency models like Threads and Fibers. We'll explore how Ractors enable parallel execution by isolating objects, provide practical examples, and discuss the implications of using Ractors in your Ruby applications.

### Understanding Ractors

#### Definition and Purpose

Ractors, short for "Ruby Actors," are a concurrency abstraction introduced in Ruby 3 to achieve parallel execution. Unlike Threads, which share memory space and require careful synchronization to avoid race conditions, Ractors provide a model where each Ractor has its own isolated memory space. This isolation helps avoid thread safety issues, making it easier to write concurrent programs that can run in parallel on multiple CPU cores.

#### How Ractors Enable Parallel Execution

Ractors achieve parallel execution by isolating objects. Each Ractor has its own heap, and objects cannot be shared directly between Ractors. Instead, communication between Ractors is done through message passing, ensuring that each Ractor operates independently without interfering with others.

### Creating and Communicating Between Ractors

Let's explore how to create Ractors and facilitate communication between them.

#### Creating a Ractor

Creating a Ractor is straightforward. You use the `Ractor.new` method, passing a block of code that the Ractor will execute. Here's a simple example:

```ruby
# Create a Ractor that calculates the sum of an array
ractor = Ractor.new([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) do |numbers|
  numbers.sum
end

# Retrieve the result from the Ractor
result = ractor.take
puts "Sum: #{result}"  # Output: Sum: 15
```

In this example, we create a Ractor that calculates the sum of an array. The `take` method is used to retrieve the result from the Ractor.

#### Communicating Between Ractors

Communication between Ractors is done through message passing. You can send messages to a Ractor using the `send` method and receive messages using the `receive` method. Here's an example:

```ruby
# Create a Ractor that receives a message and prints it
receiver = Ractor.new do
  message = Ractor.receive
  puts "Received: #{message}"
end

# Send a message to the receiver Ractor
receiver.send("Hello, Ractor!")

# Output: Received: Hello, Ractor!
```

In this example, we create a Ractor that waits for a message and prints it. We then send a message to the Ractor using the `send` method.

### Immutability and Object Sharing Rules

Ractors enforce immutability and strict object sharing rules to ensure safe parallel execution. Here's what you need to know:

- **Immutable Objects**: Immutable objects, such as numbers and symbols, can be shared between Ractors without restrictions.
- **Shareable Objects**: Objects that are explicitly marked as shareable can be shared between Ractors. You can mark an object as shareable using the `Ractor.make_shareable` method.
- **Copying Objects**: Non-shareable objects are copied when sent between Ractors, ensuring that each Ractor has its own independent copy.

Here's an example demonstrating these concepts:

```ruby
# Create a Ractor that processes a shareable object
ractor = Ractor.new do
  obj = Ractor.receive
  puts "Processing: #{obj}"
end

# Create a shareable object
shareable_obj = Ractor.make_shareable({ key: "value" })

# Send the shareable object to the Ractor
ractor.send(shareable_obj)

# Output: Processing: {:key=>"value"}
```

In this example, we create a shareable object and send it to a Ractor for processing.

### Ractors vs. Threads and Fibers

Ractors differ from Threads and Fibers in several key ways:

- **Isolation**: Ractors provide isolated memory spaces, reducing the risk of race conditions and making it easier to write safe concurrent code.
- **Parallelism**: Ractors enable true parallelism by running on multiple CPU cores, whereas Threads are limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in MRI Ruby.
- **Communication**: Ractors communicate through message passing, while Threads share memory space and require synchronization mechanisms.

### Practical Considerations and Performance Implications

When using Ractors, consider the following:

- **Overhead**: Ractors introduce some overhead due to message passing and object isolation. Use Ractors when the benefits of parallelism outweigh this overhead.
- **Design**: Design your application to leverage Ractors effectively, focusing on tasks that can be parallelized and benefit from isolated execution.
- **Performance**: Measure and profile your application to ensure that Ractors provide the desired performance improvements.

### Limitations and Potential Pitfalls

While Ractors offer significant advantages, they also have limitations:

- **Complexity**: Designing applications with Ractors can be complex, especially when coordinating multiple Ractors.
- **Debugging**: Debugging Ractor-based applications can be challenging due to the isolated nature of Ractors.
- **Compatibility**: Not all Ruby libraries and gems are Ractor-compatible. Ensure that your dependencies support Ractors before adopting them.

### Conclusion

Ractors in Ruby 3 provide a powerful tool for achieving true parallelism, enabling developers to write concurrent applications that run efficiently on multiple CPU cores. By understanding the concepts of isolation, message passing, and immutability, you can leverage Ractors to build scalable and maintainable applications. Remember to consider the practical implications and limitations of Ractors when designing your applications.
