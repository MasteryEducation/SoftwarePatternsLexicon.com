## 3.5 File I/O and System Interaction

In this section, we delve into the essential aspects of file input/output (I/O) operations and system interaction in Ruby. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building robust applications that can efficiently handle data and interact with the operating system. We'll explore reading from and writing to files, executing system commands, and ensuring secure and efficient resource management.

### Introduction to File I/O in Ruby

File I/O operations are fundamental to many applications, enabling them to read from and write to files, which are essential for data persistence and manipulation. Ruby provides a rich set of classes and methods to handle file operations efficiently.

#### The `File` and `IO` Classes

Ruby's `File` and `IO` classes are the primary interfaces for file operations. The `File` class is a subclass of `IO`, providing additional methods specific to file handling.

- **File**: Represents a file and provides methods for reading, writing, and manipulating files.
- **IO**: Represents an input/output stream, providing methods for reading from and writing to streams.

### Reading from Files

Reading data from files is a common requirement in many applications. Ruby provides several methods to read files, each suited for different use cases.

#### Reading Entire File Content

To read the entire content of a file, you can use the `File.read` method. This method reads the entire file into a string.

```ruby
# Read the entire content of a file
file_content = File.read('example.txt')
puts file_content
```

#### Reading File Line by Line

For large files, reading the entire content at once may not be efficient. Instead, you can read the file line by line using `File.foreach`.

```ruby
# Read file line by line
File.foreach('example.txt') do |line|
  puts line
end
```

#### Using `IO.readlines`

The `IO.readlines` method reads all lines of a file into an array, where each element is a line from the file.

```ruby
# Read all lines into an array
lines = IO.readlines('example.txt')
lines.each { |line| puts line }
```

### Writing to Files

Writing data to files is equally important. Ruby provides several methods to write data to files, allowing you to choose the most suitable approach for your needs.

#### Writing with `File.write`

The `File.write` method writes data to a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist or overwriting it if it does.

```ruby
# Write data to a file
File.write('output.txt', "Hello, Ruby!\n")
```

#### Using `File.open` for Writing

For more control over file writing, you can use `File.open` with a block. This method ensures the file is properly closed after writing.

```ruby
# Open a file for writing
File.open('output.txt', 'w') do |file|
  file.puts "Hello, Ruby!"
end
```

### File Modes and Path Handling

Understanding file modes and path handling is crucial for effective file operations.

#### File Modes

File modes determine how a file is opened and manipulated. Common modes include:

- `'r'`: Read-only
- `'w'`: Write-only (truncates existing file)
- `'a'`: Append (write-only, starts at end of file)
- `'r+'`: Read and write
- `'w+'`: Read and write (truncates existing file)
- `'a+'`: Read and append

```ruby
# Open a file in append mode
File.open('output.txt', 'a') do |file|
  file.puts "Appending a new line."
end
```

#### Handling File Paths

Ruby provides methods to handle file paths, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.

- **`File.join`**: Joins multiple strings into a single path.
- **`File.expand_path`**: Converts a relative path to an absolute path.

```ruby
# Join paths
path = File.join('directory', 'subdirectory', 'file.txt')
puts path

# Expand relative path to absolute
absolute_path = File.expand_path('~/file.txt')
puts absolute_path
```

### File Manipulation Methods

Ruby offers various methods to manipulate files, such as renaming, deleting, and checking existence.

#### Renaming and Deleting Files

- **`File.rename`**: Renames a file.
- **`File.delete`**: Deletes a file.

```ruby
# Rename a file
File.rename('old_name.txt', 'new_name.txt')

# Delete a file
File.delete('unnecessary_file.txt')
```

#### Checking File Existence

- **`File.exist?`**: Checks if a file exists.
- **`File.directory?`**: Checks if a path is a directory.

```ruby
# Check if a file exists
puts File.exist?('example.txt') ? 'File exists' : 'File does not exist'

# Check if a path is a directory
puts File.directory?('directory') ? 'Is a directory' : 'Not a directory'
```

### Executing System Commands

Ruby allows you to execute system commands directly from your code, providing powerful capabilities for interacting with the operating system.

#### Using Backticks and `%x{}`

You can execute system commands using backticks or the `%x{}` syntax. Both return the standard output of the command as a string.

```ruby
# Execute a system command using backticks
output = `ls`
puts output

# Execute a system command using %x{}
output = %x{ls}
puts output
```

### Handling Exceptions and Resource Management

When performing file I/O and system interactions, it's crucial to handle exceptions and ensure resources are properly managed.

#### Exception Handling

Use `begin...rescue...end` blocks to handle exceptions and ensure your application can gracefully recover from errors.

```ruby
begin
  File.open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') do |file|
    puts file.read
  end
rescue Errno::ENOENT => e
  puts "File not found: #{e.message}"
end
```

#### Ensuring Resource Closure

Use blocks with `File.open` to ensure files are automatically closed after operations, preventing resource leaks.

```ruby
# Automatically close file after reading
File.open('example.txt', 'r') do |file|
  puts file.read
end
```

### Best Practices for Security

When interacting with the file system and executing system commands, it's essential to follow best practices for security.

#### Avoiding Command Injection

Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent command injection attacks.

```ruby
# Unsafe: Directly using user input in system command
user_input = "some_input"
output = `ls #{user_input}`

# Safe: Validate and sanitize user input
sanitized_input = Shellwords.escape(user_input)
output = `ls #{sanitized_input}`
```

#### Using Secure File Permissions

Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access and prevent unauthorized modifications.

```ruby
# Set file permissions to read-only for owner
File.chmod(0400, 'sensitive_file.txt')
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics, try experimenting with the code examples. Modify the file paths, change file modes, or execute different system commands to see how Ruby handles these operations. Remember, practice is key to mastering file I/O and system interaction in Ruby.

### Visualizing File I/O and System Interaction

To better understand the flow of file I/O operations and system interaction, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
