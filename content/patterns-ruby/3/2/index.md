## 3.2 Working with Collections and Enumerables

In Ruby, collections are fundamental structures that allow us to store and manipulate groups of data. The language provides several built-in collection classes, such as arrays, hashes, ranges, and sets, each with its unique characteristics and use cases. Coupled with the powerful Enumerable module, Ruby collections become versatile tools for data manipulation and iteration. In this section, we will delve into these collections, explore the Enumerable module, and demonstrate how these tools enable functional programming techniques in Ruby.

### Introduction to Ruby Collections

Ruby collections are objects that hold multiple items. They are essential for handling data in a structured way. Let's explore the primary collection types in Ruby:

#### Arrays

Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of objects. They can hold objects of any type, including other arrays.

```ruby
# Creating an array
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Accessing elements
puts fruits[0]  # Output: apple

# Adding elements
fruits << "date"
puts fruits.inspect  # Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Removing elements
fruits.delete("banana")
puts fruits.inspect  # Output: ["apple", "cherry", "date"]
```

#### Hashes

Hashes are collections of key-value pairs. They are similar to dictionaries in other programming languages.

```ruby
# Creating a hash
person = { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" }

# Accessing values
puts person[:name]  # Output: Alice

# Adding key-value pairs
person[:occupation] = "Engineer"
puts person.inspect  # Output: {:name=>"Alice", :age=>30, :city=>"New York", :occupation=>"Engineer"}

# Removing key-value pairs
person.delete(:age)
puts person.inspect  # Output: {:name=>"Alice", :city=>"New York", :occupation=>"Engineer"}
```

#### Ranges

Ranges represent a sequence of values, typically numbers or characters. They are defined by a start and an end value.

```ruby
# Creating a range
range = (1..5)

# Iterating over a range
range.each do |number|
  puts number
end
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5

# Checking if a value is within a range
puts range.include?(3)  # Output: true
```

#### Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are part of the `Set` class, which requires the `set` library.

```ruby
require 'set'

# Creating a set
numbers = Set.new([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Adding elements
numbers.add(5)
puts numbers.inspect  # Output: #<Set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}>

# Removing elements
numbers.delete(2)
puts numbers.inspect  # Output: #<Set: {1, 3, 4, 5}>
```

### The Enumerable Module

The Enumerable module is a powerful mixin that provides a collection of methods for traversing, searching, sorting, and manipulating collections. It is included in classes like Array, Hash, and Range, allowing these classes to use its methods.

#### Key Enumerable Methods

Let's explore some of the most commonly used methods provided by the Enumerable module:

##### `each`

The `each` method iterates over each element in a collection, executing a block of code for each element.

```ruby
# Using each with an array
fruits.each do |fruit|
  puts fruit
end
# Output: apple banana cherry date
```

##### `map`

The `map` method transforms each element in a collection according to the block's logic and returns a new array with the transformed elements.

```ruby
# Using map to transform an array
uppercase_fruits = fruits.map { |fruit| fruit.upcase }
puts uppercase_fruits.inspect  # Output: ["APPLE", "BANANA", "CHERRY", "DATE"]
```

##### `select`

The `select` method filters elements based on the block's condition and returns a new array containing only the elements for which the block returns true.

```ruby
# Using select to filter an array
long_fruits = fruits.select { |fruit| fruit.length > 5 }
puts long_fruits.inspect  # Output: ["banana", "cherry"]
```

##### `reduce`

The `reduce` method (also known as `inject`) combines all elements of a collection by applying a binary operation, specified by a block or symbol.

```ruby
# Using reduce to sum numbers
sum = numbers.reduce(0) { |total, number| total + number }
puts sum  # Output: 13
```

##### `find`

The `find` method returns the first element for which the block returns true.

```ruby
# Using find to locate an element
found_fruit = fruits.find { |fruit| fruit.start_with?('c') }
puts found_fruit  # Output: cherry
```

##### `all?`, `any?`, `none?`, `one?`

These methods check if all, any, none, or exactly one element in a collection meets a specified condition.

```ruby
# Using all? to check a condition
all_long = fruits.all? { |fruit| fruit.length > 3 }
puts all_long  # Output: true

# Using any? to check a condition
any_short = fruits.any? { |fruit| fruit.length < 5 }
puts any_short  # Output: true
```

### Functional Programming with Enumerables

Ruby's Enumerable module enables functional programming techniques by allowing you to manipulate collections in a declarative manner. This approach emphasizes the use of functions and immutable data structures, leading to more predictable and maintainable code.

#### Immutability and Transformation

By using methods like `map` and `select`, you can transform collections without modifying the original data, promoting immutability.

```ruby
# Original array
original_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Transforming with map
squared_numbers = original_numbers.map { |number| number**2 }
puts squared_numbers.inspect  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Original array remains unchanged
puts original_numbers.inspect  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### Chaining Methods

Ruby allows you to chain Enumerable methods to perform complex operations in a concise and readable way.

```ruby
# Chaining methods to filter and transform
result = fruits.select { |fruit| fruit.length > 5 }.map { |fruit| fruit.upcase }
puts result.inspect  # Output: ["BANANA", "CHERRY"]
```

### Practice Problems

To solidify your understanding of collections and enumerables, try solving these practice problems:

1. **Problem 1**: Given an array of numbers, return a new array containing only the even numbers, each multiplied by 2.

2. **Problem 2**: Create a hash that counts the frequency of each word in a given sentence.

3. **Problem 3**: Given a range of numbers, find the sum of all numbers divisible by 3.

4. **Problem 4**: Implement a method that takes an array of strings and returns a hash with the strings as keys and their lengths as values.

5. **Problem 5**: Use a set to find the unique elements in an array of numbers.

### Visualizing Enumerables

To better understand how Enumerable methods work, let's visualize the process of transforming and filtering collections using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start with Collection] --> B{Apply Enumerable Method}
    B -->|map| C[Transform Elements]
    B -->|select| D[Filter Elements]
    B -->|reduce| E[Combine Elements]
    C --> F[New Collection]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[End with Result]
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of applying Enumerable methods to a collection. Depending on the method used (`map`, `select`, `reduce`), the collection is transformed, filtered, or combined, resulting in a new collection.
