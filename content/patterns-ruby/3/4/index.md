## 3.4 Regular Expressions and String Manipulation

In the world of Ruby programming, regular expressions (regex) and string manipulation are indispensable tools. They allow developers to efficiently search, parse, and transform text data, which is a common requirement in many applications. In this section, we will delve into Ruby's robust support for regular expressions and explore various string manipulation techniques. We'll cover the syntax, common patterns, and methods like `match`, `gsub`, `scan`, and `split`. Additionally, we'll discuss performance considerations and best practices for working with large texts.

### Understanding Regular Expressions in Ruby

Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are used for pattern matching within strings. Ruby's regex capabilities are built into the language, making it easy to integrate them into your code.

#### Basic Regex Syntax

Let's start by understanding the basic syntax of regular expressions in Ruby:

- **Literal Characters**: Match themselves. For example, `/abc/` matches the string "abc".
- **Metacharacters**: Special characters with specific meanings, such as `.` (any character), `*` (zero or more), `+` (one or more), `?` (zero or one), `^` (beginning of line), and `$` (end of line).
- **Character Classes**: Defined using square brackets, e.g., `[abc]` matches any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
- **Predefined Character Classes**: Include `\d` (digits), `\w` (word characters), `\s` (whitespace), and their uppercase counterparts for negation.
- **Quantifiers**: Specify the number of occurrences, e.g., `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}`.
- **Groups and Captures**: Parentheses `()` are used to group patterns and capture matches.
- **Alternation**: The pipe `|` is used for logical OR operations.

#### Example: Basic Regex

```ruby
pattern = /hello/
puts "hello world".match?(pattern) # Output: true
```

### Common Regex Patterns

Understanding common regex patterns can greatly enhance your ability to manipulate strings. Here are some frequently used patterns:

- **Email Validation**: `/\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i`
- **Phone Number**: `/\\(?\d{3}\\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}/`
- **URL Matching**: `/\b((http|https):\/\/)?[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)+([/?].*)?\b/i`

### Ruby Methods for Regex and String Manipulation

Ruby provides several methods for working with regular expressions and strings. Let's explore some of the most commonly used ones.

#### The `match` Method

The `match` method checks if a string matches a regex pattern and returns a `MatchData` object if a match is found.

```ruby
pattern = /world/
match_data = "hello world".match(pattern)
puts match_data[0] # Output: "world"
```

#### The `gsub` Method

The `gsub` method is used to replace all occurrences of a pattern with a specified replacement.

```ruby
text = "hello world"
new_text = text.gsub(/world/, "Ruby")
puts new_text # Output: "hello Ruby"
```

#### The `scan` Method

The `scan` method returns an array of all matches for a pattern.

```ruby
text = "one two three"
matches = text.scan(/\w+/)
puts matches.inspect # Output: ["one", "two", "three"]
```

#### The `split` Method

The `split` method divides a string into an array based on a pattern.

```ruby
text = "one, two, three"
parts = text.split(/,\s*/)
puts parts.inspect # Output: ["one", "two", "three"]
```

### Parsing and Validating Strings

Regular expressions are powerful for parsing and validating strings. Let's look at some examples.

#### Parsing CSV Data

```ruby
csv_data = "name,age,city\nJohn,30,New York\nJane,25,Los Angeles"
rows = csv_data.split("\n")
rows.each do |row|
  columns = row.split(",")
  puts columns.inspect
end
```

#### Validating Email Addresses

```ruby
def valid_email?(email)
  pattern = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i
  email.match?(pattern)
end

puts valid_email?("test@example.com") # Output: true
puts valid_email?("invalid-email")    # Output: false
```

### Performance Considerations

When working with large texts, performance becomes crucial. Here are some tips:

- **Optimize Patterns**: Avoid overly complex patterns that can slow down matching.
- **Use Non-Capturing Groups**: Use `(?:...)` for groups that don't need capturing to improve performance.
- **Benchmarking**: Use Ruby's `Benchmark` module to measure and optimize regex performance.

### Testing Regular Expressions

Thoroughly testing your regular expressions is essential to ensure they work as expected. Consider using tools like [Rubular](https://rubular.com/) for testing and visualizing regex patterns.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code examples to deepen your understanding:

1. Modify the `gsub` example to replace multiple words.
2. Create a regex pattern to extract domain names from URLs.
3. Write a method to validate phone numbers using regex.

### Visualizing Regex Patterns

To better understand how regex patterns work, let's visualize a simple regex pattern using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Match Character}
    B -->|Yes| C[Next Character]
    B -->|No| D[End]
    C --> B
```
