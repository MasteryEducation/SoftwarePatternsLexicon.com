## 6.7 Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a fundamental behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object, known as the subject, changes its state, all its dependents, known as observers, are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications, as it promotes loose coupling between components.

### Intent of the Observer Pattern

The primary intent of the Observer pattern is to define a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen and react to events or changes in another object. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object needs to notify other objects without making assumptions about who those objects are.

### Key Participants

1. **Subject**: The object that holds the state and sends notifications to observers when changes occur.
2. **Observer**: The object that wants to be informed about changes in the subject.
3. **ConcreteSubject**: A specific implementation of the subject.
4. **ConcreteObserver**: A specific implementation of the observer that reacts to changes in the subject.

### Applicability

The Observer pattern is applicable in various scenarios, including:

- **Event Handling**: When you need to notify multiple components about events, such as user actions or system events.
- **Data Binding**: In applications where UI components need to reflect changes in the underlying data model.
- **Distributed Systems**: When changes in one component need to be propagated to other components across a network.

### Ruby's `Observable` Module

Ruby provides a built-in `Observable` module that simplifies the implementation of the Observer pattern. This module can be included in any class to make it observable. Here's how it works:

```ruby
require 'observer'

class TemperatureSensor
  include Observable

  def initialize
    @temperature = 0
  end

  def temperature=(new_temperature)
    @temperature = new_temperature
    changed
    notify_observers(@temperature)
  end
end

class TemperatureDisplay
  def update(temperature)
    puts "Temperature updated to #{temperature} degrees."
  end
end

sensor = TemperatureSensor.new
display = TemperatureDisplay.new

sensor.add_observer(display)
sensor.temperature = 25
```

**Explanation**:
- The `TemperatureSensor` class includes the `Observable` module, allowing it to manage a list of observers.
- The `temperature=` method updates the temperature and notifies all observers of the change.
- The `TemperatureDisplay` class implements an `update` method, which is called when the temperature changes.

### Alternative Implementations Without `Observable`

While Ruby's `Observable` module is convenient, you might want to implement the Observer pattern manually for more control or to avoid dependencies. Here's an example:

```ruby
class ManualTemperatureSensor
  def initialize
    @observers = []
    @temperature = 0
  end

  def add_observer(observer)
    @observers << observer
  end

  def remove_observer(observer)
    @observers.delete(observer)
  end

  def temperature=(new_temperature)
    @temperature = new_temperature
    notify_observers
  end

  private

  def notify_observers
    @observers.each { |observer| observer.update(@temperature) }
  end
end

class ManualTemperatureDisplay
  def update(temperature)
    puts "Temperature updated to #{temperature} degrees."
  end
end

sensor = ManualTemperatureSensor.new
display = ManualTemperatureDisplay.new

sensor.add_observer(display)
sensor.temperature = 30
```

**Explanation**:
- The `ManualTemperatureSensor` class manages its own list of observers and manually notifies them of changes.
- This approach provides more flexibility but requires more boilerplate code.

### Use Cases

1. **Event Handling**: The Observer pattern is ideal for implementing event-driven architectures where components need to react to events without being tightly coupled.
2. **Data Binding**: In GUI applications, the Observer pattern can be used to keep the UI in sync with the underlying data model.
3. **Real-Time Systems**: In systems where real-time updates are crucial, such as stock trading platforms, the Observer pattern ensures that all components are updated promptly.

### Benefits of the Observer Pattern

- **Decoupling**: Observers and subjects are loosely coupled, allowing for more flexible and maintainable code.
- **Scalability**: New observers can be added without modifying the subject.
- **Reusability**: Observers can be reused across different subjects.

### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Notifying a large number of observers can be resource-intensive. Consider using asynchronous notifications if performance is a concern.
- **Memory Leaks**: Ensure that observers are properly removed to prevent memory leaks.
- **Complexity**: While the Observer pattern simplifies certain aspects of design, it can also introduce complexity if not managed properly.

### Ruby Unique Features

Ruby's dynamic nature and built-in `Observable` module make implementing the Observer pattern straightforward. The ability to include modules and dynamically define methods enhances flexibility and reduces boilerplate code.

### Differences and Similarities

The Observer pattern is often confused with the Publish-Subscribe pattern. While both involve notifying multiple subscribers, the Publish-Subscribe pattern typically involves a message broker, whereas the Observer pattern involves direct communication between subjects and observers.

### Visualizing the Observer Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        +addObserver(observer)
        +removeObserver(observer)
        +notifyObservers()
    }
    class ConcreteSubject {
        +state
        +getState()
        +setState(state)
    }
    class Observer {
        +update()
    }
    class ConcreteObserver {
        +update()
    }
    Subject <|-- ConcreteSubject
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver
    ConcreteSubject --> Observer : notifies
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the relationship between the subject and its observers. The `ConcreteSubject` maintains a list of `Observer` instances and notifies them of state changes.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Observer pattern by modifying the code examples. Try adding multiple observers to the `TemperatureSensor` and see how they react to temperature changes. Consider implementing a new observer that logs temperature changes to a file.
