## 6.9 Strategy Pattern

### Introduction

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it, promoting flexibility and reusability in your codebase.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows clients to choose which algorithm to use, providing a way to configure a class with one of many behaviors.

### Problem Addressed

In software development, you often encounter scenarios where you need to perform a task using different algorithms. For instance, sorting data can be done using various algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, or mergesort. The Strategy Pattern addresses the need for interchangeable algorithms, allowing you to switch between them without altering the client code.

### Key Participants

1. **Strategy**: An interface common to all supported algorithms. Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy.
2. **ConcreteStrategy**: Implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object.

### Applicability

Use the Strategy Pattern when:

- You have multiple related classes that differ only in their behavior.
- You need different variants of an algorithm.
- You want to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures.
- A class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations.

### Implementing the Strategy Pattern in Ruby

Ruby's dynamic nature makes it an excellent language for implementing the Strategy Pattern. You can use modules, classes, or Procs to define strategies.

#### Using Classes

```ruby
# Define the Strategy interface
class PaymentStrategy
  def pay(amount)
    raise NotImplementedError, 'This method should be overridden'
  end
end

# ConcreteStrategy: CreditCard
class CreditCardPayment < PaymentStrategy
  def pay(amount)
    puts "Paying #{amount} using Credit Card."
  end
end

# ConcreteStrategy: PayPal
class PayPalPayment < PaymentStrategy
  def pay(amount)
    puts "Paying #{amount} using PayPal."
  end
end

# Context
class ShoppingCart
  attr_accessor :payment_strategy

  def initialize(payment_strategy)
    @payment_strategy = payment_strategy
  end

  def checkout(amount)
    @payment_strategy.pay(amount)
  end
end

# Client code
cart = ShoppingCart.new(CreditCardPayment.new)
cart.checkout(100)

cart.payment_strategy = PayPalPayment.new
cart.checkout(200)
```

#### Using Modules

```ruby
module PaymentStrategy
  def pay(amount)
    raise NotImplementedError, 'This method should be overridden'
  end
end

class CreditCardPayment
  include PaymentStrategy

  def pay(amount)
    puts "Paying #{amount} using Credit Card."
  end
end

class PayPalPayment
  include PaymentStrategy

  def pay(amount)
    puts "Paying #{amount} using PayPal."
  end
end

class ShoppingCart
  attr_accessor :payment_strategy

  def initialize(payment_strategy)
    @payment_strategy = payment_strategy
  end

  def checkout(amount)
    @payment_strategy.pay(amount)
  end
end

cart = ShoppingCart.new(CreditCardPayment.new)
cart.checkout(100)

cart.payment_strategy = PayPalPayment.new
cart.checkout(200)
```

#### Using Procs

```ruby
credit_card_payment = Proc.new { |amount| puts "Paying #{amount} using Credit Card." }
paypal_payment = Proc.new { |amount| puts "Paying #{amount} using PayPal." }

class ShoppingCart
  attr_accessor :payment_strategy

  def initialize(payment_strategy)
    @payment_strategy = payment_strategy
  end

  def checkout(amount)
    @payment_strategy.call(amount)
  end
end

cart = ShoppingCart.new(credit_card_payment)
cart.checkout(100)

cart.payment_strategy = paypal_payment
cart.checkout(200)
```

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern

- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between different algorithms at runtime.
- **Reusability**: Reuse algorithms across different contexts.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate the algorithm from the context, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

### Design Considerations

- **Complexity**: Introducing the Strategy Pattern can add complexity to your codebase. Ensure that the benefits outweigh the added complexity.
- **Overhead**: If the strategy objects are stateless, they can be shared across contexts to reduce overhead.

### Ruby Unique Features

Ruby's dynamic typing and support for blocks and Procs make it particularly well-suited for the Strategy Pattern. You can leverage Ruby's flexibility to create concise and expressive strategy implementations.

### Differences and Similarities

The Strategy Pattern is often confused with the State Pattern. While both patterns involve changing behavior at runtime, the Strategy Pattern is used to select an algorithm, whereas the State Pattern is used to change the state of an object.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        -Strategy strategy
        +setStrategy(Strategy strategy)
        +executeStrategy()
    }
    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        +execute()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        +execute()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        +execute()
    }
    Context --> Strategy
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the Strategy Pattern. The `Context` class maintains a reference to a `Strategy` object and can execute the strategy. `ConcreteStrategyA` and `ConcreteStrategyB` are implementations of the `Strategy` interface.
