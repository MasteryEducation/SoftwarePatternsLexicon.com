## 6.6 Memento Pattern

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state, enabling undo or rollback functionality. This pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the state to be restored later.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Memento Pattern is to capture an object's internal state so that it can be restored later, without exposing the details of the object's implementation. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo or rollback functionality.

### Problem Addressed

In many applications, there is a need to revert an object to a previous state. Consider a text editor where users can undo their last action. Implementing such functionality requires capturing the state of the object at various points in time and restoring it when needed. The challenge is to do this without exposing the internal state of the object, which could lead to violations of encapsulation.

### Key Participants

- **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
- **Memento**: The object that stores the state of the Originator. It is opaque to other objects.
- **Caretaker**: The object responsible for keeping track of the Memento. It does not modify or inspect the contents of the Memento.

### Applicability

Use the Memento Pattern when:

- You need to save and restore the state of an object.
- Direct access to the state would expose implementation details.
- You want to implement undo/redo functionality.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's demonstrate how to implement the Memento Pattern in Ruby with a simple example of a text editor that can undo text changes.

```ruby
# The Originator class
class TextEditor
  attr_accessor :content

  def initialize
    @content = ""
  end

  def write(text)
    @content += text
  end

  def save
    Memento.new(@content)
  end

  def restore(memento)
    @content = memento.state
  end
end

# The Memento class
class Memento
  attr_reader :state

  def initialize(state)
    @state = state
  end
end

# The Caretaker class
class Caretaker
  def initialize
    @mementos = []
  end

  def backup(memento)
    @mementos.push(memento)
  end

  def undo
    @mementos.pop
  end
end

# Usage
editor = TextEditor.new
caretaker = Caretaker.new

editor.write("Hello, ")
caretaker.backup(editor.save)

editor.write("world!")
caretaker.backup(editor.save)

puts "Current content: #{editor.content}" # Output: Hello, world!

editor.restore(caretaker.undo)
puts "After undo: #{editor.content}" # Output: Hello, 

editor.restore(caretaker.undo)
puts "After another undo: #{editor.content}" # Output: 
```

### Design Considerations

#### Memory Impact

One of the primary considerations when using the Memento Pattern is the memory impact. Each Memento stores a snapshot of the Originator's state, which can consume significant memory if the state is large or if many Mementos are stored. Consider implementing strategies to limit the number of Mementos or compress the state data.

#### Encapsulation Principles

The Memento Pattern is designed to preserve encapsulation by keeping the Memento's state private. The Originator is the only class that can access the Memento's state, ensuring that the internal details of the Originator are not exposed to other classes.

### Ruby Unique Features

Ruby's dynamic nature and metaprogramming capabilities make it particularly well-suited for implementing the Memento Pattern. You can leverage Ruby's `Marshal` module for serialization, which allows you to easily save and restore object states.

```ruby
# Using Marshal for serialization
class TextEditor
  # ...

  def save
    Marshal.dump(@content)
  end

  def restore(serialized_state)
    @content = Marshal.load(serialized_state)
  end
end
```

### Differences and Similarities

The Memento Pattern is often confused with the Command Pattern, as both can be used to implement undo functionality. However, the Command Pattern focuses on encapsulating actions, while the Memento Pattern focuses on capturing and restoring state.

### Visualizing the Memento Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Originator {
        -state: String
        +createMemento(): Memento
        +restore(memento: Memento): void
    }
    class Memento {
        -state: String
        +getState(): String
    }
    class Caretaker {
        -mementos: List~Memento~
        +addMemento(memento: Memento): void
        +getMemento(index: int): Memento
    }
    Originator --> Memento
    Caretaker --> Memento
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by adding more functionality to the `TextEditor` class, such as redo operations. Try modifying the `Caretaker` to limit the number of stored Mementos or implement a more complex state management system.
