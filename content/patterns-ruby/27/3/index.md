## 27.3 Pattern Reference Cheat Sheet

Welcome to the Pattern Reference Cheat Sheet, a quick-reference guide designed to help you recall and compare the design patterns discussed in this guide. This section provides concise summaries of each pattern, highlighting their intent, applicability, and unique features in Ruby. Let's dive into the world of design patterns and explore how they can enhance your Ruby applications.

### Creational Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Singleton {
        -Singleton instance
        +getInstance()
      }
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Singleton class
- **Applicability**: Use when exactly one instance of a class is needed to control access to shared resources.
- **Ruby Unique Features**: Ruby's `Module#instance` method can be used to implement singletons easily.
- **Design Considerations**: Be cautious of thread safety when implementing singletons in a multithreaded environment.

#### Factory Method Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Creator {
        +factoryMethod()
      }
      class ConcreteCreator {
        +factoryMethod()
      }
      Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Creator, ConcreteCreator
- **Applicability**: Use when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- **Ruby Unique Features**: Ruby's dynamic typing allows for flexible factory methods without the need for strict type declarations.
- **Design Considerations**: Consider using this pattern when you need to decouple the creation of objects from their usage.

#### Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class AbstractFactory {
        +createProductA()
        +createProductB()
      }
      class ConcreteFactory1 {
        +createProductA()
        +createProductB()
      }
      AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory1
  ```
- **Key Participants**: AbstractFactory, ConcreteFactory
- **Applicability**: Use when a system should be independent of how its products are created.
- **Ruby Unique Features**: Ruby's modules can be used to define abstract factories, promoting code reuse.
- **Design Considerations**: Ensure that the factory interface is flexible enough to accommodate new product families.

### Structural Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern
- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Target {
        +request()
      }
      class Adapter {
        +request()
      }
      class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
      }
      Adapter --> Adaptee
      Target <|-- Adapter
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Target, Adapter, Adaptee
- **Applicability**: Use when you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- **Ruby Unique Features**: Ruby's open classes allow for easy adaptation of existing classes.
- **Design Considerations**: Be mindful of the performance overhead introduced by the adapter.

#### Decorator Pattern
- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Component {
        +operation()
      }
      class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation()
      }
      class Decorator {
        +operation()
      }
      class ConcreteDecorator {
        +operation()
      }
      Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecorator
      Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
      Decorator --> Component
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Component, Decorator, ConcreteDecorator
- **Applicability**: Use to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently.
- **Ruby Unique Features**: Ruby's mixins and modules can be used to implement decorators.
- **Design Considerations**: Ensure that decorators are transparent to the client.

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Observer Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Subject {
        +attach()
        +detach()
        +notify()
      }
      class ConcreteSubject {
        +getState()
        +setState()
      }
      class Observer {
        +update()
      }
      class ConcreteObserver {
        +update()
      }
      Subject <|-- ConcreteSubject
      Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver
      ConcreteSubject --> Observer
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Subject, Observer, ConcreteObserver
- **Applicability**: Use when a change to one object requires changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed.
- **Ruby Unique Features**: Ruby's `Observable` module can be used to implement this pattern easily.
- **Design Considerations**: Be aware of potential performance issues with a large number of observers.

#### Strategy Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Context {
        +setStrategy()
        +executeStrategy()
      }
      class Strategy {
        +algorithmInterface()
      }
      class ConcreteStrategyA {
        +algorithmInterface()
      }
      class ConcreteStrategyB {
        +algorithmInterface()
      }
      Context --> Strategy
      Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
      Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Context, Strategy, ConcreteStrategy
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to use different variants of an algorithm.
- **Ruby Unique Features**: Ruby's blocks and procs can be used to implement strategies.
- **Design Considerations**: Ensure that strategies are interchangeable and can be selected at runtime.

### Ruby Unique Features in Design Patterns

Ruby's dynamic nature and powerful features like blocks, procs, and mixins make it uniquely suited for implementing design patterns. Here are some Ruby-specific considerations:

- **Dynamic Typing**: Allows for flexible pattern implementations without strict type constraints.
- **Mixins and Modules**: Enable code reuse and can be used to implement patterns like Decorator and Strategy.
- **Blocks and Procs**: Facilitate the implementation of behavioral patterns like Strategy and Command.
- **Open Classes**: Allow for easy adaptation and extension of existing classes, useful in patterns like Adapter and Decorator.
- **Metaprogramming**: Provides powerful tools for implementing patterns dynamically, such as Singleton and Factory Method.

### Design Considerations and Pitfalls

When implementing design patterns in Ruby, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Some patterns may introduce overhead, so evaluate their impact on performance.
- **Complexity**: Avoid over-engineering by using patterns only when they provide clear benefits.
- **Thread Safety**: Be mindful of concurrency issues, especially with patterns like Singleton.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure that the use of patterns enhances, rather than complicates, the maintainability of your codebase.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Singleton vs. Multiton**: Singleton ensures a single instance, while Multiton manages multiple instances.
- **Factory Method vs. Abstract Factory**: Factory Method focuses on a single product, while Abstract Factory deals with families of products.
- **Adapter vs. Decorator**: Adapter changes an interface, while Decorator adds behavior.
