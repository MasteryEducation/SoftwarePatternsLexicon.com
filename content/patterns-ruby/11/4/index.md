## 11.4 Observer Pattern and Event Handling

In this section, we delve into the Observer pattern, a cornerstone of reactive programming, and its application in event handling within Ruby. We'll explore how this pattern facilitates efficient data flow management and event-driven architectures, providing advanced examples and discussing its limitations and enhancements through reactive programming.

### Introduction to the Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a change in one object requires changes in others, without tightly coupling the objects.

#### Key Participants

- **Subject**: Maintains a list of observers and provides an interface for adding or removing observers.
- **Observer**: Defines an interface for objects that should be notified of changes in the subject.
- **ConcreteSubject**: Stores state of interest to ConcreteObservers and sends notifications to its observers when its state changes.
- **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the Observer interface to keep its state consistent with the subject's.

### Observer Pattern in Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a paradigm that focuses on asynchronous data streams and the propagation of change. The Observer pattern aligns well with reactive principles by allowing objects to subscribe to events and react to changes in state or data flow.

#### Reactive Programming Principles

- **Data Streams**: Treat data as a continuous flow, allowing for real-time processing and updates.
- **Propagation of Change**: Automatically update dependent components when data changes, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle data and events asynchronously, improving performance and responsiveness.

### Implementing the Observer Pattern in Ruby

Ruby provides a flexible environment for implementing the Observer pattern, thanks to its dynamic nature and support for blocks and lambdas. Let's explore a basic implementation of the Observer pattern in Ruby.

```ruby
# Subject module to manage observers
module Subject
  def initialize
    @observers = []
  end

  def add_observer(observer)
    @observers << observer
  end

  def remove_observer(observer)
    @observers.delete(observer)
  end

  def notify_observers
    @observers.each { |observer| observer.update(self) }
  end
end

# ConcreteSubject class
class WeatherStation
  include Subject

  attr_reader :temperature

  def initialize
    super()
    @temperature = 0
  end

  def set_temperature(new_temperature)
    @temperature = new_temperature
    notify_observers
  end
end

# Observer interface
class Observer
  def update(subject)
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"
  end
end

# ConcreteObserver class
class TemperatureDisplay < Observer
  def update(subject)
    puts "TemperatureDisplay: The current temperature is #{subject.temperature}°C"
  end
end

# Usage
weather_station = WeatherStation.new
display = TemperatureDisplay.new

weather_station.add_observer(display)
weather_station.set_temperature(25)
```

In this example, `WeatherStation` acts as the subject, while `TemperatureDisplay` is an observer that reacts to changes in temperature.

### Advanced Event Handling with the Observer Pattern

In more complex applications, event handling can involve multiple observers and subjects, with intricate dependencies and data flows. Let's explore a more advanced example that demonstrates these concepts.

```ruby
# Advanced Subject module with event types
module AdvancedSubject
  def initialize
    @observers = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = [] }
  end

  def add_observer(event_type, observer)
    @observers[event_type] << observer
  end

  def remove_observer(event_type, observer)
    @observers[event_type].delete(observer)
  end

  def notify_observers(event_type, data)
    @observers[event_type].each { |observer| observer.update(event_type, data) }
  end
end

# ConcreteSubject class with multiple event types
class StockMarket
  include AdvancedSubject

  def update_stock_price(stock, price)
    notify_observers(:stock_price_updated, { stock: stock, price: price })
  end

  def announce_news(news)
    notify_observers(:news_announced, { news: news })
  end
end

# Observer interface with event type handling
class AdvancedObserver
  def update(event_type, data)
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"
  end
end

# ConcreteObserver class handling specific events
class StockPriceDisplay < AdvancedObserver
  def update(event_type, data)
    if event_type == :stock_price_updated
      puts "StockPriceDisplay: The price of #{data[:stock]} is now $#{data[:price]}"
    end
  end
end

class NewsDisplay < AdvancedObserver
  def update(event_type, data)
    if event_type == :news_announced
      puts "NewsDisplay: Breaking news - #{data[:news]}"
    end
  end
end

# Usage
stock_market = StockMarket.new
stock_display = StockPriceDisplay.new
news_display = NewsDisplay.new

stock_market.add_observer(:stock_price_updated, stock_display)
stock_market.add_observer(:news_announced, news_display)

stock_market.update_stock_price("AAPL", 150)
stock_market.announce_news("New product launch!")
```

In this example, `StockMarket` can notify observers of different event types, allowing for more granular control over event handling.

### Limitations of the Observer Pattern

While the Observer pattern is powerful, it has limitations:

- **Tight Coupling**: Observers are often tightly coupled to the subject, making changes difficult.
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple observers and event types can become complex and error-prone.
- **Performance**: Notifying a large number of observers can impact performance.

### Enhancing the Observer Pattern with Reactive Programming

Reactive programming addresses these limitations by providing a more flexible and scalable approach to event handling and data flow management.

#### Reactive Streams

Reactive streams extend the Observer pattern by introducing backpressure and flow control, allowing for more efficient data processing.

- **Backpressure**: Manage the flow of data to prevent overwhelming consumers.
- **Flow Control**: Dynamically adjust the rate of data production and consumption.

#### Implementing Reactive Streams in Ruby

Ruby's `RxRuby` library provides tools for implementing reactive streams, enhancing the Observer pattern with reactive programming principles.

```ruby
require 'rx'

# Observable stream
observable = Rx::Observable.create do |observer|
  observer.on_next(1)
  observer.on_next(2)
  observer.on_next(3)
  observer.on_completed
end

# Observer
observer = Rx::Observer.create(
  lambda { |x| puts "Received: #{x}" },
  lambda { |err| puts "Error: #{err}" },
  lambda { puts "Completed" }
)

# Subscription
subscription = observable.subscribe(observer)
```

In this example, we create an observable stream that emits a sequence of numbers, and an observer that reacts to each emitted value.

### Differences Between Traditional Observers and Reactive Streams

- **Traditional Observers**: Focus on state changes and notifications, often leading to tight coupling and complexity.
- **Reactive Streams**: Emphasize data flow and asynchronous processing, providing more flexibility and scalability.

### Conclusion

The Observer pattern is a fundamental tool for event handling and data flow management in Ruby. By integrating reactive programming principles, we can overcome its limitations and build more efficient and scalable applications. Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll discover more advanced techniques and patterns that will enhance your Ruby development skills. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
