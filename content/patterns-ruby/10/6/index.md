## 10.6 Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Code

In the realm of concurrent programming, handling exceptions effectively is crucial to building robust and reliable applications. Ruby, with its support for threads, fibers, and the newer Ractors, offers multiple concurrency models. However, each comes with its own set of challenges when it comes to exception handling. In this section, we will explore how exceptions propagate in concurrent Ruby code, how they can be silently lost, and strategies to capture and handle them effectively.

### Understanding Exception Propagation in Threads and Fibers

In Ruby, exceptions are a way to signal that something has gone wrong. When an exception is raised, Ruby looks for a rescue block to handle it. If no such block is found, the program terminates. However, in concurrent programming, the behavior of exceptions can be more complex.

#### Threads

In Ruby, each thread runs independently, and exceptions raised in one thread do not propagate to other threads. This means that if an exception occurs in a thread and is not handled, it can be silently lost, potentially leaving the application in an inconsistent state.

```ruby
thread = Thread.new do
  raise "An error occurred"
end

# Main thread continues execution
puts "Main thread continues..."
```

In the example above, the exception raised in the thread does not affect the main thread, and the message "Main thread continues..." is printed. The exception is silently lost unless explicitly handled.

#### Fibers

Fibers are a lightweight concurrency primitive in Ruby, allowing for cooperative multitasking. Unlike threads, fibers do not run concurrently but rather yield control back to the calling code. Exceptions in fibers behave similarly to those in threads, where they do not propagate to the calling context unless explicitly handled.

```ruby
fiber = Fiber.new do
  raise "Fiber error"
end

begin
  fiber.resume
rescue => e
  puts "Caught exception: #{e.message}"
end
```

In this example, the exception raised in the fiber is caught in the calling context, demonstrating how you can handle exceptions from fibers.

### Capturing and Handling Exceptions in Threads

To ensure that exceptions in threads are not lost, you can wrap the thread's execution block in a begin-rescue-end construct. This allows you to capture exceptions and handle them appropriately.

```ruby
thread = Thread.new do
  begin
    raise "An error occurred in the thread"
  rescue => e
    puts "Caught exception in thread: #{e.message}"
  end
end

thread.join
```

By using a rescue block within the thread, you can capture exceptions and take corrective actions, such as logging the error or retrying the operation.

### Using Thread Pools and Exception Handling Strategies

Thread pools are a common pattern in concurrent programming, allowing you to manage a pool of worker threads to perform tasks. When using thread pools, it's important to ensure that exceptions are handled properly to prevent the entire pool from being disrupted by a single error.

```ruby
require 'concurrent-ruby'

pool = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5)

5.times do |i|
  pool.post do
    begin
      raise "Error in task #{i}"
    rescue => e
      puts "Handled exception in task #{i}: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end

pool.shutdown
pool.wait_for_termination
```

In this example, we use the `concurrent-ruby` gem to create a fixed thread pool. Each task is wrapped in a begin-rescue block to handle exceptions individually, ensuring that one task's failure does not affect others.

### Exception Handling with Ractors

Ractors, introduced in Ruby 3, provide a way to achieve true parallelism by isolating memory between concurrent units of execution. Exceptions in Ractors are isolated, meaning an exception in one Ractor does not affect others.

```ruby
ractor = Ractor.new do
  raise "Ractor error"
end

begin
  ractor.take
rescue => e
  puts "Caught exception from Ractor: #{e.message}"
end
```

In this example, the exception raised in the Ractor is captured when attempting to retrieve its result with `ractor.take`. This demonstrates how exceptions can be handled when working with Ractors.

### Best Practices for Exception Handling in Concurrent Code

To ensure that exceptions in concurrent code are not missed, consider the following best practices:

- **Wrap Thread Execution**: Always wrap the execution block of threads and fibers in a begin-rescue-end construct to capture exceptions.
- **Use Logging**: Log exceptions to provide visibility into errors that occur in concurrent code.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement mechanisms to gracefully shut down threads and Ractors in case of unhandled exceptions.
- **Monitor and Alert**: Use monitoring tools to detect and alert on exceptions in concurrent code.
- **Test Concurrent Code**: Thoroughly test concurrent code to ensure that exceptions are handled as expected.

### Visualizing Exception Propagation

To better understand how exceptions propagate in concurrent Ruby code, let's visualize the flow using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main
    participant Thread1
    participant Thread2

    Main->>Thread1: Start Thread1
    Main->>Thread2: Start Thread2
    Thread1->>Thread1: Raise Exception
    Thread1->>Main: Exception Handled
    Thread2->>Thread2: Raise Exception
    Thread2->>Main: Exception Handled
    Main->>Main: Continue Execution
```

This diagram illustrates how exceptions in threads are handled independently and do not affect the main thread's execution.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples above. Experiment with different exception types, add logging, or implement a retry mechanism. Observe how exceptions are handled and how they affect the flow of concurrent code.
