## 17.3 Monitoring Applications with Prometheus

In today's fast-paced software development environment, monitoring applications is crucial for ensuring performance, reliability, and user satisfaction. Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, has become a popular choice for developers due to its powerful features and flexibility. In this section, we'll explore how to use Prometheus to monitor Ruby applications, collect metrics, and set up alerts.

### Introduction to Prometheus

Prometheus is a robust system designed for monitoring and alerting. It was originally developed at SoundCloud and has since become a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Prometheus is known for its multidimensional data model, flexible query language (PromQL), and efficient time-series database.

**Key Features of Prometheus:**

- **Multidimensional Data Model**: Allows for the collection of metrics with labels, enabling powerful querying and aggregation.
- **PromQL**: A flexible query language for extracting and analyzing metrics.
- **Pull-Based Model**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from instrumented applications, ensuring that the monitoring system is in control.
- **Alerting**: Supports alerting based on metric thresholds and conditions.
- **Integration with Visualization Tools**: Easily integrates with tools like Grafana for creating dashboards.

### Exposing Metrics from Ruby Applications

To monitor a Ruby application with Prometheus, we need to expose application metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape. The `prometheus-client-ruby` library is a popular choice for this purpose.

#### Setting Up `prometheus-client-ruby`

1. **Installation**: Add the `prometheus-client` gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.

   ```ruby
   gem 'prometheus-client'
   ```

2. **Creating a Metrics Endpoint**: Create an endpoint in your application to expose metrics. This is typically done by adding a route that returns metrics in the Prometheus format.

   ```ruby
   require 'prometheus/client'

   # Create a new registry
   prometheus = Prometheus::Client.registry

   # Create a new counter metric
   http_requests_total = Prometheus::Client::Counter.new(:http_requests_total, docstring: 'A counter of HTTP requests made')
   prometheus.register(http_requests_total)

   # Increment the counter
   http_requests_total.increment

   # Expose metrics
   get '/metrics' do
     content_type 'text/plain'
     prometheus.text
   end
   ```

#### Instrumenting Code to Collect Metrics

Prometheus supports several types of metrics, including counters, gauges, and histograms. Let's explore how to use these in a Ruby application.

- **Counters**: Used to count occurrences of events. They only increase.

  ```ruby
  http_requests_total.increment(labels: { method: 'get', handler: '/home' })
  ```

- **Gauges**: Used to measure values that can go up and down, such as temperature or current memory usage.

  ```ruby
  memory_usage = Prometheus::Client::Gauge.new(:memory_usage, docstring: 'Current memory usage in bytes')
  prometheus.register(memory_usage)
  memory_usage.set(1024 * 1024 * 512) # Set to 512MB
  ```

- **Histograms**: Used to observe and bucket values, such as request durations.

  ```ruby
  request_duration = Prometheus::Client::Histogram.new(:request_duration_seconds, docstring: 'Request duration in seconds')
  prometheus.register(request_duration)
  request_duration.observe(0.5) # Observe a request that took 0.5 seconds
  ```

### Setting Up a Prometheus Server

Once your application is instrumented to expose metrics, you'll need to set up a Prometheus server to scrape these metrics.

1. **Download and Install Prometheus**: Download the latest version of Prometheus from the [official website](https://prometheus.io/download/).

2. **Configure Prometheus**: Create a configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) to define scrape targets.

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to 15 seconds

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'ruby_app'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:4567'] # Replace with your application's metrics endpoint
   ```

3. **Start Prometheus**: Run Prometheus with the configuration file.

   ```bash
   ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
   ```

### Creating Alerts Based on Metric Thresholds

Prometheus supports alerting based on metric thresholds. Alerts are defined in a separate configuration file and evaluated by the Prometheus server.

1. **Define Alert Rules**: Create an alert rule file (`alerts.yml`).

   ```yaml
   groups:
   - name: example
     rules:
     - alert: HighMemoryUsage
       expr: memory_usage > 1024 * 1024 * 1024 # 1GB
       for: 5m
       labels:
         severity: critical
       annotations:
         summary: "High memory usage detected"
         description: "Memory usage is above 1GB for more than 5 minutes."
   ```

2. **Configure Prometheus to Use Alert Rules**: Update `prometheus.yml` to include the alert rule file.

   ```yaml
   rule_files:
     - 'alerts.yml'
   ```

3. **Set Up Alertmanager**: Prometheus uses Alertmanager to handle alerts. Configure Alertmanager to send notifications via email, Slack, or other channels.

### Benefits of Proactive Monitoring and Observability

Proactive monitoring and observability provide several benefits:

- **Early Detection of Issues**: Identify and resolve issues before they impact users.
- **Performance Optimization**: Gain insights into application performance and optimize resource usage.
- **Improved Reliability**: Ensure application reliability by monitoring key metrics and setting up alerts.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use metrics to make informed decisions about application architecture and infrastructure.

### Integrating with Visualization Tools like Grafana

Grafana is a powerful visualization tool that integrates seamlessly with Prometheus. It allows you to create interactive dashboards and visualize metrics.

1. **Install Grafana**: Download and install Grafana from the [official website](https://grafana.com/get).

2. **Add Prometheus as a Data Source**: In Grafana, add Prometheus as a data source by providing the Prometheus server URL.

3. **Create Dashboards**: Use Grafana's dashboard editor to create visualizations of your metrics.

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
       A[Prometheus] -->|Scrapes Metrics| B[Grafana];
       B -->|Visualizes Data| C[User];
   ```
