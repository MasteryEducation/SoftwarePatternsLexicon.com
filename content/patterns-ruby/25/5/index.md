Let's walk through creating a simple Pong game using Ruby2D and Gosu. We'll cover the basic structure, game loop, rendering, and input handling.

#### Game Structure

A typical game consists of the following components:

- **Game Loop**: The core loop that updates game state and renders graphics.
- **Rendering**: Drawing graphics on the screen.
- **Input Handling**: Capturing and responding to user input.

#### Implementing Pong with Ruby2D

```ruby
require 'ruby2d'

set title: "Pong Game", width: 640, height: 480

# Paddle class
class Paddle
  attr_accessor :x, :y

  def initialize(x, y)
    @x, @y = x, y
    @shape = Rectangle.new(x: @x, y: @y, width: 20, height: 100, color: 'white')
  end

  def move_up
    @y -= 5 if @y > 0
    @shape.y = @y
  end

  def move_down
    @y += 5 if @y < Window.height - 100
    @shape.y = @y
  end
end

# Ball class
class Ball
  attr_accessor :x, :y, :x_velocity, :y_velocity

  def initialize
    @x, @y = Window.width / 2, Window.height / 2
    @x_velocity, @y_velocity = 2, 2
    @shape = Circle.new(x: @x, y: @y, radius: 10, color: 'white')
  end

  def move
    @x += @x_velocity
    @y += @y_velocity
    @shape.x = @x
    @shape.y = @y
  end

  def bounce
    @y_velocity = -@y_velocity if @y <= 0 || @y >= Window.height
  end
end

# Initialize paddles and ball
left_paddle = Paddle.new(10, Window.height / 2 - 50)
right_paddle = Paddle.new(Window.width - 30, Window.height / 2 - 50)
ball = Ball.new

update do
  ball.move
  ball.bounce

  # Paddle collision logic
  if ball.x <= left_paddle.x + 20 && ball.y.between?(left_paddle.y, left_paddle.y + 100)
    ball.x_velocity = -ball.x_velocity
  elsif ball.x >= right_paddle.x - 10 && ball.y.between?(right_paddle.y, right_paddle.y + 100)
    ball.x_velocity = -ball.x_velocity
  end

  # Paddle movement
  left_paddle.move_up if Window.key_down?('w')
  left_paddle.move_down if Window.key_down?('s')
  right_paddle.move_up if Window.key_down?('up')
  right_paddle.move_down if Window.key_down?('down')
end

show
```

#### Implementing Pong with Gosu

```ruby
require 'gosu'

class Pong < Gosu::Window
  def initialize
    super 640, 480
    self.caption = "Pong Game"

    @left_paddle = Paddle.new(10, height / 2 - 50)
    @right_paddle = Paddle.new(width - 30, height / 2 - 50)
    @ball = Ball.new
  end

  def update
    @ball.move
    @ball.bounce(height)

    # Paddle collision logic
    if @ball.x <= @left_paddle.x + 20 && @ball.y.between?(@left_paddle.y, @left_paddle.y + 100)
      @ball.x_velocity = -@ball.x_velocity
    elsif @ball.x >= @right_paddle.x - 10 && @ball.y.between?(@right_paddle.y, @right_paddle.y + 100)
      @ball.x_velocity = -@ball.x_velocity
    end

    # Paddle movement
    @left_paddle.move_up if button_down?(Gosu::KB_W)
    @left_paddle.move_down if button_down?(Gosu::KB_S)
    @right_paddle.move_up if button_down?(Gosu::KB_UP)
    @right_paddle.move_down if button_down?(Gosu::KB_DOWN)
  end

  def draw
    @left_paddle.draw
    @right_paddle.draw
    @ball.draw
  end
end

class Paddle
  attr_reader :x, :y

  def initialize(x, y)
    @x, @y = x, y
  end

  def move_up
    @y -= 5 if @y > 0
  end

  def move_down
    @y += 5 if @y < 480 - 100
  end

  def draw
    Gosu.draw_rect(@x, @y, 20, 100, Gosu::Color::WHITE)
  end
end

class Ball
  attr_reader :x, :y
  attr_accessor :x_velocity, :y_velocity

  def initialize
    @x, @y = 320, 240
    @x_velocity, @y_velocity = 2, 2
  end

  def move
    @x += @x_velocity
    @y += @y_velocity
  end

  def bounce(height)
    @y_velocity = -@y_velocity if @y <= 0 || @y >= height
  end

  def draw
    Gosu.draw_circle(@x, @y, 10, 32, Gosu::Color::WHITE)
  end
end

Pong.new.show
```

### Key Concepts in Game Development

#### Game Loops

The game loop is the heart of any game. It continuously updates the game state and renders the graphics. In Ruby2D and Gosu, the game loop is managed by the library, allowing you to focus on implementing the game logic.

#### Rendering

Rendering involves drawing graphics on the screen. Both Ruby2D and Gosu provide methods to render shapes, images, and text. In Ruby2D, you use objects like `Rectangle` and `Circle`, while in Gosu, you use methods like `draw_rect` and `draw_circle`.

#### User Input Handling

Handling user input is crucial for interactive games. Ruby2D uses the `Window.key_down?` method to check for key presses, while Gosu provides the `button_down?` method.

### Organizing Game Code with Design Patterns

#### State Pattern

The State pattern is useful for managing different states in a game, such as menus, gameplay, and pause screens. It allows you to encapsulate state-specific behavior and switch between states easily.

```ruby
class Game
  attr_accessor :state

  def initialize
    @state = MenuState.new(self)
  end

  def update
    @state.update
  end

  def draw
    @state.draw
  end
end

class MenuState
  def initialize(game)
    @game = game
  end

  def update
    # Transition to PlayState on user input
    @game.state = PlayState.new(@game) if Window.key_down?('enter')
  end

  def draw
    # Draw menu
  end
end

class PlayState
  def initialize(game)
    @game = game
  end

  def update
    # Game logic
  end

  def draw
    # Draw game
  end
end
```

#### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is useful for managing events and notifications in a game. It allows you to decouple the game logic from the event handling code.

```ruby
class EventManager
  def initialize
    @listeners = []
  end

  def subscribe(listener)
    @listeners << listener
  end

  def notify(event)
    @listeners.each { |listener| listener.update(event) }
  end
end

class Player
  def update(event)
    # React to event
  end
end

event_manager = EventManager.new
player = Player.new

event_manager.subscribe(player)
event_manager.notify('player_scored')
```

### Best Practices for Performance Optimization

- **Optimize Rendering**: Minimize the number of draw calls and use spritesheets to reduce rendering overhead.
- **Efficient Collision Detection**: Use spatial partitioning techniques to reduce the number of collision checks.
- **Memory Management**: Reuse objects and avoid unnecessary allocations to reduce garbage collection overhead.

### Encouraging Experimentation

Game development is a creative process. Experiment with extending the game features by adding new mechanics, improving graphics, or incorporating sound effects. Try modifying the code examples to create your own unique game.

### Visualizing Game Architecture

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game {
        -State state
        +update()
        +draw()
    }
    class State {
        <<interface>>
        +update()
        +draw()
    }
    class MenuState {
        +update()
        +draw()
    }
    class PlayState {
        +update()
        +draw()
    }
    Game --> State
    MenuState --> State
    PlayState --> State
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the use of the State pattern in a game architecture. The `Game` class maintains a reference to the current `State`, which can be either `MenuState` or `PlayState`. Each state implements the `update` and `draw` methods, allowing the game to switch between states seamlessly.
