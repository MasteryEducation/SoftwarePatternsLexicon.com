## 25.11 Building a Compiler Front-End

Building a compiler front-end is a fascinating journey into the world of language processing. In this section, we will explore how to construct a compiler front-end using Ruby, focusing on key components such as lexical analysis, parsing, and abstract syntax tree (AST) generation. We will introduce tools like Racc and Parslet for parsing, provide examples of defining a grammar and generating tokens, and demonstrate how to parse input code and construct an AST. Additionally, we will discuss error handling and reporting within the compiler, and explain how design patterns like Visitor and Interpreter can be applied. Finally, we will highlight applications of custom compilers or domain-specific languages (DSLs) in software development and encourage experimentation with extending the compiler to additional language features.

### Understanding the Compiler Front-End

A compiler front-end is responsible for analyzing the source code and transforming it into an intermediate representation, typically an abstract syntax tree (AST). This process involves several stages:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Breaking down the source code into tokens.
2. **Parsing**: Analyzing the tokens to ensure they conform to the grammar of the language and generating an AST.
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Ensuring the AST adheres to the language's semantic rules.

Let's dive into each of these stages and explore how they can be implemented in Ruby.

### Lexical Analysis

Lexical analysis, or tokenization, is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of meaning in the source code, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

#### Implementing a Lexer in Ruby

A lexer can be implemented in Ruby by defining a set of regular expressions that match the different types of tokens. Here's a simple example of a lexer for a basic arithmetic language:

```ruby
class Lexer
  Token = Struct.new(:type, :value)

  def initialize(input)
    @input = input
    @position = 0
  end

  def tokenize
    tokens = []
    while @position < @input.length
      case
      when match = @input[@position..-1].match(/\A\s+/)
        # Skip whitespace
      when match = @input[@position..-1].match(/\A\d+/)
        tokens << Token.new(:NUMBER, match[0].to_i)
      when match = @input[@position..-1].match(/\A\+/)
        tokens << Token.new(:PLUS, match[0])
      when match = @input[@position..-1].match(/\A-/)
        tokens << Token.new(:MINUS, match[0])
      else
        raise "Unexpected character: #{@input[@position]}"
      end
      @position += match[0].length
    end
    tokens
  end
end

# Example usage
lexer = Lexer.new("3 + 5 - 2")
tokens = lexer.tokenize
tokens.each { |token| puts "#{token.type}: #{token.value}" }
```

### Parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation

Parsing is the process of analyzing the sequence of tokens to ensure they conform to the grammar of the language. The result of parsing is typically an abstract syntax tree (AST), which represents the hierarchical structure of the source code.

#### Using Racc for Parsing

[Racc](https://github.com/tenderlove/racc) is a popular parser generator for Ruby, similar to Yacc or Bison. It allows you to define a grammar and generate a parser from it.

Here's an example of using Racc to parse a simple arithmetic expression:

```ruby
require 'racc/parser'

class ArithmeticParser < Racc::Parser
  rule 'expression : expression PLUS term
                   | expression MINUS term
                   | term' do |expression, operator, term|
    if operator
      { type: operator, left: expression, right: term }
    else
      expression
    end
  end

  rule 'term : NUMBER' do |number|
    { type: :NUMBER, value: number }
  end

  on_error do |error_token|
    raise "Syntax error at #{error_token}"
  end
end

# Example usage
parser = ArithmeticParser.new
ast = parser.parse([[:NUMBER, 3], [:PLUS, '+'], [:NUMBER, 5], [:MINUS, '-'], [:NUMBER, 2]])
puts ast.inspect
```

#### Using Parslet for Parsing

[Parslet](http://kschiess.github.io/parslet/) is another Ruby library for parsing, which provides a more Ruby-like syntax for defining grammars.

Here's an example of using Parslet to parse the same arithmetic expression:

```ruby
require 'parslet'

class ArithmeticParser < Parslet::Parser
  rule(:number) { match('[0-9]').repeat(1).as(:number) }
  rule(:plus) { str('+') >> space? }
  rule(:minus) { str('-') >> space? }
  rule(:space?) { match('\s').repeat }

  rule(:expression) do
    (number.as(:left) >> (plus | minus).as(:operator) >> number.as(:right)).as(:expression)
  end

  root(:expression)
end

class ArithmeticTransform < Parslet::Transform
  rule(number: simple(:x)) { Integer(x) }
  rule(expression: { left: simple(:left), operator: '+', right: simple(:right) }) { left + right }
  rule(expression: { left: simple(:left), operator: '-', right: simple(:right) }) { left - right }
end

# Example usage
parser = ArithmeticParser.new
transform = ArithmeticTransform.new
ast = parser.parse('3 + 5 - 2')
result = transform.apply(ast)
puts result
```

### Error Handling and Reporting

Error handling is a crucial part of any compiler. A good compiler should provide meaningful error messages that help the developer understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

In our examples, both Racc and Parslet provide mechanisms for error handling. Racc allows you to define an `on_error` method to handle syntax errors, while Parslet raises exceptions that can be caught and processed to provide user-friendly error messages.

### Applying Design Patterns

Design patterns like Visitor and Interpreter can be applied to enhance the functionality of a compiler front-end.

#### Visitor Pattern

The Visitor pattern can be used to separate the operations performed on an AST from the structure of the AST itself. This allows you to add new operations without modifying the AST classes.

Here's an example of using the Visitor pattern to evaluate an AST:

```ruby
class ASTNode
  def accept(visitor)
    visitor.visit(self)
  end
end

class NumberNode < ASTNode
  attr_reader :value

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end
end

class BinaryOperationNode < ASTNode
  attr_reader :operator, :left, :right

  def initialize(operator, left, right)
    @operator = operator
    @left = left
    @right = right
  end
end

class Evaluator
  def visit(node)
    case node
    when NumberNode
      node.value
    when BinaryOperationNode
      left_value = node.left.accept(self)
      right_value = node.right.accept(self)
      case node.operator
      when :PLUS
        left_value + right_value
      when :MINUS
        left_value - right_value
      end
    end
  end
end

# Example usage
ast = BinaryOperationNode.new(:PLUS, NumberNode.new(3), NumberNode.new(5))
evaluator = Evaluator.new
result = ast.accept(evaluator)
puts result
```

#### Interpreter Pattern

The Interpreter pattern can be used to directly execute the AST without converting it to another form. This is particularly useful for implementing simple scripting languages or DSLs.

### Applications of Custom Compilers or DSLs

Custom compilers or DSLs can be used in a variety of applications, such as:

- **Configuration Languages**: Creating a DSL for configuring applications or systems.
- **Data Transformation**: Implementing a language for transforming data from one format to another.
- **Scripting**: Building a scripting language for automating tasks within an application.

### Encouraging Experimentation

Building a compiler front-end is a complex task, but it's also a rewarding one. We encourage you to experiment with extending the compiler to support additional language features, such as:

- **Control Structures**: Adding support for if statements, loops, etc.
- **Functions**: Implementing function definitions and calls.
- **Types**: Introducing a type system to the language.
