## 25.2 Building an API-Only Application

In today's digital landscape, API-only applications have become a cornerstone for enabling seamless communication between different software systems. Whether you're building a backend for a mobile app, a microservice architecture, or a public API for third-party developers, understanding how to create robust and efficient API-only applications is crucial. In this section, we'll explore the process of building an API-only application using Ruby, focusing on frameworks, RESTful principles, security, performance, and documentation.

### Introduction to API-Only Applications

API-only applications are designed to serve as the backend for various clients, such as web browsers, mobile apps, or other services. Unlike traditional web applications that render HTML views, API-only applications focus on delivering data in formats like JSON or XML. This separation of concerns allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as different clients can consume the same API endpoints.

**Use Cases for API-Only Applications:**

- **Mobile Backend:** Providing data and services to mobile applications.
- **Microservices:** Enabling communication between different services in a microservices architecture.
- **Public APIs:** Allowing third-party developers to integrate with your services.
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs):** Serving data to client-side applications built with frameworks like React or Angular.

### Choosing the Right Framework

When building an API-only application in Ruby, selecting the appropriate framework is essential. Two popular choices are Rails API mode and Grape.

#### Rails API Mode

Rails, a well-known web application framework, offers an API mode that strips away unnecessary middleware and components, focusing solely on API development. This mode provides all the benefits of Rails, such as ActiveRecord, routing, and middleware, while optimizing for API performance.

#### Grape

Grape is a lightweight Ruby framework designed specifically for building RESTful APIs. It offers a simple DSL for defining API endpoints and supports features like parameter validation, versioning, and error handling.

### Setting Up the Project

Let's walk through setting up a new API-only application using Rails API mode.

#### Step 1: Create a New Rails API Application

```bash
rails new my_api --api
```

The `--api` flag creates a new Rails application optimized for API-only development.

#### Step 2: Configure the Application

Open `config/application.rb` and ensure the following configuration is set:

```ruby
module MyApi
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.api_only = true
  end
end
```

This configuration ensures that only essential middleware is loaded, improving performance.

### Implementing Endpoints

In an API-only application, endpoints are the primary means of interaction. Let's create a simple resource, such as a `Post`, to demonstrate endpoint implementation.

#### Step 1: Generate a Resource

```bash
rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text
```

This command generates a model, controller, and routes for the `Post` resource.

#### Step 2: Define Routes

Open `config/routes.rb` and ensure the routes are defined:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts
end
```

#### Step 3: Customize the Controller

Open `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb` and customize the actions as needed. For example, you might want to restrict the fields returned in the JSON response:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
    render json: @posts, only: [:id, :title, :body]
  end
end
```

### RESTful Principles

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that guides API design. Key principles include:

- **Statelessness:** Each request from a client must contain all the information needed to process it.
- **Resource-Based:** APIs should expose resources, such as `posts` or `users`, and use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on them.
- **Uniform Interface:** Consistent use of URIs, HTTP methods, and response codes.

### Serialization and Response Formats

Serialization is the process of converting Ruby objects into a format suitable for API responses, such as JSON or XML. ActiveModel Serializers is a popular library for this purpose.

#### Using ActiveModel Serializers

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'active_model_serializers'
```

Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

Create a serializer for the `Post` model:

```bash
rails generate serializer Post
```

Open `app/serializers/post_serializer.rb` and define the attributes to be serialized:

```ruby
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body
end
```

Now, when you render a `Post` object, it will use the serializer to format the response:

```ruby
render json: @post
```

### Authentication and Authorization

Securing your API is crucial. Common strategies include JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth2.

#### JWT Authentication

JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's commonly used for stateless authentication.

Add the `jwt` gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'jwt'
```

Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

Create a method to encode and decode JWTs:

```ruby
class JsonWebToken
  SECRET_KEY = Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base.to_s

  def self.encode(payload, exp = 24.hours.from_now)
    payload[:exp] = exp.to_i
    JWT.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY)
  end

  def self.decode(token)
    body = JWT.decode(token, SECRET_KEY)[0]
    HashWithIndifferentAccess.new body
  rescue
    nil
  end
end
```

Use this class to authenticate users in your controllers.

### Performance Optimization

Performance is critical for API applications. Techniques such as caching and pagination can significantly improve response times.

#### Caching

Rails provides built-in support for caching. You can cache entire responses or fragments of responses.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Rails.cache.fetch('posts', expires_in: 12.hours) do
      Post.all
    end
    render json: @posts
  end
end
```

#### Pagination

Pagination helps manage large datasets by breaking them into smaller, more manageable chunks. The `kaminari` gem is a popular choice for pagination.

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'kaminari'
```

Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

Use it in your controller:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.page(params[:page]).per(10)
    render json: @posts
  end
end
```

### API Documentation

Clear documentation is essential for API usability. Tools like Swagger and Apiary can help generate interactive API documentation.

#### Using Swagger

Swagger provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing APIs.

Add the `swagger-blocks` gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'swagger-blocks'
```

Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

Define your API documentation in a controller:

```ruby
class Api::DocsController < ApplicationController
  include Swagger::Blocks

  swagger_root do
    key :swagger, '2.0'
    info do
      key :version, '1.0.0'
      key :title, 'My API'
    end
    key :host, 'localhost:3000'
    key :basePath, '/api'
    key :consumes, ['application/json']
    key :produces, ['application/json']
  end

  swagger_path '/posts' do
    operation :get do
      key :description, 'Returns all posts'
      response 200 do
        key :description, 'Post response'
        schema type: :array do
          items do
            key :'$ref', :Post
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Testing APIs

Testing is a critical part of API development. RSpec and Postman are popular tools for testing APIs.

#### Using RSpec

RSpec is a testing framework for Ruby. To test your API, you can write request specs.

Add the `rspec-rails` gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end
```

Run `bundle install` and then `rails generate rspec:install` to set up RSpec.

Create a request spec for the `Post` resource:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "Posts", type: :request do
  describe "GET /posts" do
    it "returns all posts" do
      get posts_path
      expect(response).to have_http_status(200)
    end
  end
end
```

#### Using Postman

Postman is a tool for testing APIs by sending HTTP requests and inspecting responses. You can create collections of requests and automate testing.

### Conclusion
