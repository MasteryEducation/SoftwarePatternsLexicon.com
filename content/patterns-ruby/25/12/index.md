## 25.12 Machine Learning Applications with Ruby

Machine learning (ML) is transforming industries by enabling systems to learn from data and make intelligent decisions. While Python is the most popular language for ML, Ruby offers unique capabilities for building machine learning applications, thanks to its elegant syntax and powerful libraries like Rumale and TensorStream. In this section, we'll explore how to leverage Ruby for machine learning, covering everything from data preprocessing to model evaluation and integration with external services.

### Introduction to Ruby's Machine Learning Capabilities

Ruby, known for its simplicity and productivity, is not traditionally associated with machine learning. However, with the advent of libraries like [Rumale](https://github.com/yoshoku/rumale) and [TensorStream](https://github.com/evansde77/tensor_stream), Ruby developers can now build sophisticated ML applications. Rumale is a machine learning library for Ruby, offering a variety of algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering. TensorStream, on the other hand, provides a Ruby interface for TensorFlow, enabling deep learning capabilities.

### Solving a Machine Learning Problem: Classification Example

Let's dive into a practical example of solving a classification problem using Ruby. We'll use the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning, to classify iris flowers based on their features.

#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming features to make them suitable for modeling.

```ruby
require 'csv'
require 'rumale'

# Load the Iris dataset
data = CSV.read('iris.csv', headers: true)

# Extract features and labels
features = data.map { |row| row.fields[0..3].map(&:to_f) }
labels = data.map { |row| row['species'] }

# Encode labels to integers
label_encoder = Rumale::Preprocessing::LabelEncoder.new
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

# Normalize features
scaler = Rumale::Preprocessing::MinMaxScaler.new
normalized_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)
```

In this code, we load the Iris dataset, extract features and labels, encode the labels into integers, and normalize the features using Min-Max scaling.

#### Step 2: Training a Model

With the data preprocessed, we can now train a machine learning model. We'll use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier from Rumale.

```ruby
# Split the data into training and test sets
splitter = Rumale::ModelSelection::StratifiedShuffleSplit.new(test_size: 0.2, random_seed: 1)
train_ids, test_ids = splitter.split(normalized_features, encoded_labels).first

train_features = normalized_features[train_ids]
train_labels = encoded_labels[train_ids]
test_features = normalized_features[test_ids]
test_labels = encoded_labels[test_ids]

# Train an SVM classifier
svm = Rumale::LinearModel::SVC.new
svm.fit(train_features, train_labels)
```

Here, we split the data into training and test sets using stratified shuffle split to maintain the distribution of classes. We then train an SVM classifier on the training data.

#### Step 3: Evaluating Model Performance

Evaluating the model's performance is essential to understand its effectiveness. We can use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

```ruby
# Predict on the test set
predicted_labels = svm.predict(test_features)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = Rumale::EvaluationMeasure::Accuracy.new
accuracy_score = accuracy.score(test_labels, predicted_labels)

puts "Model Accuracy: #{accuracy_score * 100}%"
```

In this snippet, we predict the labels for the test set and calculate the accuracy of the model.

### Integrating with External Machine Learning Services

While Ruby can handle many machine learning tasks, there are scenarios where integrating with external services is beneficial. Services like AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI, and IBM Watson offer powerful ML capabilities that can be accessed via APIs.

#### Example: Using Google Cloud Vision API

Let's explore how to integrate Ruby with Google Cloud Vision API to perform image classification.

```ruby
require 'google/cloud/vision'

# Initialize the Vision API client
vision = Google::Cloud::Vision.image_annotator

# Load an image
image_path = 'path/to/image.jpg'
image = vision.image(image_path)

# Perform label detection
response = image.label_detection

# Output the labels
response.responses.each do |res|
  res.label_annotations.each do |label|
    puts "Label: #{label.description}, Score: #{label.score}"
  end
end
```

In this example, we use the Google Cloud Vision API to detect labels in an image. The API client is initialized, and label detection is performed on the specified image.

### Limitations and Considerations

While Ruby provides tools for machine learning, there are limitations to consider:

- **Library Support**: Ruby's ML libraries are not as extensive as Python's. For complex tasks, Python might be more suitable.
- **Performance**: Ruby is not as performant as languages like C++ or Java for computationally intensive tasks.
- **Community and Resources**: The Ruby ML community is smaller, which means fewer resources and community support.

Despite these limitations, Ruby is a great choice for integrating ML into web applications, prototyping, and leveraging existing Ruby infrastructure.

### Visualization Tools for Presenting Results

Visualizing results is crucial for interpreting machine learning models. Ruby offers libraries like Gruff and Rubyvis for creating charts and graphs.

#### Example: Visualizing Model Performance

```ruby
require 'gruff'

# Create a new bar graph
g = Gruff::Bar.new
g.title = 'Model Performance'

# Add data
g.data(:Accuracy, [accuracy_score * 100])

# Write to file
g.write('model_performance.png')
```

In this example, we use Gruff to create a bar graph representing the model's accuracy.

### Encouragement to Experiment

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive machine learning applications. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples:

- Experiment with different classifiers, such as Decision Trees or K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Use a different dataset to see how the model performs.
- Integrate with another external service, like AWS SageMaker.

### Summary

We've covered data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and integration with external services. While Ruby has limitations in the ML space, it offers unique advantages for certain applications. By leveraging Ruby's capabilities, you can build intelligent systems that enhance your applications.
