## 2.5 Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas

In Ruby, blocks, procs, and lambdas are essential constructs that allow for flexible and powerful code execution. Understanding these concepts is crucial for any Ruby developer aiming to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. In this section, we will explore each of these constructs, their syntax, characteristics, and practical applications.

### Understanding Blocks

**Blocks** are anonymous pieces of code that can be passed to methods. They are not objects, but they can be converted into objects using `Proc`. Blocks are enclosed in either `{}` or `do...end` and can take parameters.

#### Syntax and Characteristics

- **Single-line blocks**: Use curly braces `{}`.
- **Multi-line blocks**: Use `do...end`.

```ruby
# Single-line block
[1, 2, 3].each { |number| puts number }

# Multi-line block
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  puts number
end
```

- **Implicit passing**: Blocks are passed implicitly to methods.
- **Yielding**: Methods can execute a block using the `yield` keyword.

```ruby
def greet
  yield "Hello"
end

greet { |greeting| puts "#{greeting}, World!" }
```

#### Practical Applications

Blocks are commonly used in iterators, callbacks, and event handling. They allow for concise and expressive code, especially when working with collections.

### Introducing Procs

**Procs** are objects that encapsulate blocks. They can be stored in variables, passed to methods, and called explicitly.

#### Creating and Using Procs

- **Creating a Proc**: Use `Proc.new` or the `proc` method.

```ruby
# Using Proc.new
my_proc = Proc.new { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }

# Using proc
my_proc = proc { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }
```

- **Calling a Proc**: Use the `call` method.

```ruby
my_proc.call("Alice")
```

#### Characteristics of Procs

- **Flexible argument handling**: Procs do not enforce the number of arguments strictly.
- **Return behavior**: A `return` inside a proc returns from the enclosing method.

```ruby
def test_proc
  my_proc = Proc.new { return "Returning from proc" }
  my_proc.call
  "This will not be printed"
end

puts test_proc
```

### Exploring Lambdas

**Lambdas** are similar to procs but with stricter argument handling and different return behavior. They are often used when you need a more function-like behavior.

#### Creating and Using Lambdas

- **Creating a Lambda**: Use `lambda` or the `->` syntax.

```ruby
# Using lambda
my_lambda = lambda { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }

# Using ->
my_lambda = ->(name) { puts "Hello, #{name}!" }
```

- **Calling a Lambda**: Use the `call` method.

```ruby
my_lambda.call("Bob")
```

#### Characteristics of Lambdas

- **Strict argument handling**: Lambdas check the number of arguments passed.
- **Return behavior**: A `return` inside a lambda returns from the lambda itself, not the enclosing method.

```ruby
def test_lambda
  my_lambda = lambda { return "Returning from lambda" }
  my_lambda.call
  "This will be printed"
end

puts test_lambda
```

### Differences Between Procs and Lambdas

Understanding the nuances between procs and lambdas is essential for choosing the right tool for your task.

- **Argument Handling**: Lambdas enforce the number of arguments, while procs do not.
- **Return Behavior**: A `return` in a proc exits the enclosing method, whereas in a lambda, it exits the lambda itself.

### Practical Applications

#### Callbacks and Event Handling

Procs and lambdas are often used for callbacks and event handling, providing a way to pass executable code to methods.

```ruby
def perform_task(callback)
  puts "Performing task..."
  callback.call
end

task_completed = -> { puts "Task completed!" }
perform_task(task_completed)
```

#### Iterators and Enumerables

Blocks, procs, and lambdas are integral to Ruby's iterators and enumerable methods, allowing for elegant and expressive code.

```ruby
# Using a block with map
squared_numbers = [1, 2, 3].map { |number| number**2 }

# Using a lambda with select
even_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4].select(&->(number) { number.even? })
```

### Visualizing Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas

To better understand the flow and interaction of blocks, procs, and lambdas, let's visualize their relationships and execution paths.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Method Call] -->|Pass Block| B[Block Execution];
    A -->|Pass Proc| C[Proc Object];
    A -->|Pass Lambda| D[Lambda Object];
    B -->|Yield| E[Block Code];
    C -->|Call| F[Proc Code];
    D -->|Call| G[Lambda Code];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates how methods can interact with blocks, procs, and lambdas. Blocks are executed with `yield`, while procs and lambdas are called explicitly.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code examples to deepen your understanding:

1. Modify the `greet` method to accept a block that takes two parameters.
2. Create a proc that accepts a variable number of arguments and prints them.
3. Write a lambda that checks if a number is prime and use it with the `select` method on an array of numbers.

### Key Takeaways

- **Blocks** are anonymous and passed implicitly to methods.
- **Procs** are objects that encapsulate blocks, allowing for flexible argument handling.
- **Lambdas** are similar to procs but with stricter argument handling and return behavior.
