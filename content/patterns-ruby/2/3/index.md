## 2.3 Functional Programming Concepts in Ruby

Functional programming (FP) is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. Ruby, while primarily an object-oriented language, provides robust support for functional programming techniques. This section explores how Ruby incorporates functional programming paradigms and how developers can leverage these concepts to build scalable and maintainable applications.

### Introduction to Functional Programming Principles

Functional programming is built on several core principles that distinguish it from other paradigms:

- **Pure Functions**: Functions that have no side effects and return the same output for the same input.
- **Immutability**: Data that cannot be changed once created.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions that can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.

Let's delve into each of these principles and see how Ruby supports them.

### Pure Functions and Immutability

**Pure Functions** are a cornerstone of functional programming. They ensure that a function's output depends only on its input parameters, without side effects like modifying global variables or I/O operations.

```ruby
# Pure function example
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end

puts add(2, 3) # Always returns 5
```

**Immutability** is the concept of creating data structures that cannot be altered after their creation. Ruby supports immutability through the `freeze` method, which prevents further modifications to an object.

```ruby
# Immutability example
array = [1, 2, 3].freeze
begin
  array << 4
rescue => e
  puts e.message # => "can't modify frozen Array"
end
```

### Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas

Ruby's blocks, procs, and lambdas are powerful tools for implementing functional programming techniques.

#### Blocks

Blocks are anonymous pieces of code that can be passed to methods. They are enclosed in `do...end` or curly braces `{}`.

```ruby
# Using a block with the each method
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  puts number * 2
end
```

#### Procs

Procs are objects that encapsulate blocks of code, allowing them to be stored in variables and passed around.

```ruby
# Proc example
double = Proc.new { |x| x * 2 }
puts double.call(5) # => 10
```

#### Lambdas

Lambdas are similar to procs but with stricter argument checking and return behavior.

```ruby
# Lambda example
triple = ->(x) { x * 3 }
puts triple.call(3) # => 9
```

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. Ruby's Enumerable module provides several higher-order functions like `map`, `select`, and `reduce`.

```ruby
# Using map as a higher-order function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_numbers = numbers.map { |n| n ** 2 }
puts squared_numbers.inspect # => [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Ruby supports recursion, but be mindful of the potential for stack overflow with deep recursion.

```ruby
# Recursive factorial function
def factorial(n)
  return 1 if n <= 1
  n * factorial(n - 1)
end

puts factorial(5) # => 120
```

### Benefits of Functional Programming in Ruby

Functional programming offers several benefits:

- **Code Clarity**: Pure functions and immutability make code easier to understand and reason about.
- **Concurrency**: Immutability reduces the risk of race conditions in concurrent applications.
- **Modularity**: Higher-order functions and first-class functions promote code reuse and modularity.

### Blending Functional and Object-Oriented Approaches

Ruby's flexibility allows developers to blend functional and object-oriented programming styles. This hybrid approach can lead to more expressive and maintainable code.

```ruby
# Blending functional and object-oriented styles
class Calculator
  def initialize
    @operations = []
  end

  def add_operation(&block)
    @operations << block
  end

  def execute_operations(value)
    @operations.reduce(value) { |acc, op| op.call(acc) }
  end
end

calculator = Calculator.new
calculator.add_operation { |x| x + 2 }
calculator.add_operation { |x| x * 3 }
puts calculator.execute_operations(5) # => 21
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the `Calculator` class to include subtraction or division operations. Explore how changing the order of operations affects the result.

### Visualizing Functional Programming Concepts

To better understand how functional programming concepts work in Ruby, let's visualize the flow of data and function calls using a diagram.

```mermaid

    A[Input Data] --> B[Pure Function]
    B --> C[Immutable Data]
    C --> D[Higher-Order Function]
    D --> E[Output Data]
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of data through a series of functional transformations, highlighting the role of pure functions and immutability.

- [x] A function that has no side effects and returns the same output for the same input
- [ ] A function that modifies global variables
- [ ] A function that performs I/O operations
- [ ] A function that depends on external state
