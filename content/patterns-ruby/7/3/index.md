## 7.3 Immutability and Functional Purity

In the realm of software development, especially when dealing with complex systems, the concepts of immutability and functional purity play a pivotal role in ensuring that our code is predictable, testable, and maintainable. In this section, we will delve into these concepts, explore how they can be applied in Ruby, and understand their significance in building robust applications.

### Understanding Immutability

**Immutability** refers to the state of an object that cannot be changed after it has been created. This concept is central to functional programming, where data is treated as immutable by default. In Ruby, while most objects are mutable, we can enforce or simulate immutability to achieve the benefits it offers.

#### Enforcing Immutability in Ruby

Ruby does not natively enforce immutability, but we can simulate it using several techniques:

1. **Freezing Objects**: The simplest way to make an object immutable in Ruby is by using the `freeze` method. Once an object is frozen, any attempt to modify it will result in a `RuntimeError`.

    ```ruby
    person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
    person.freeze

    # Attempting to modify the frozen object
    begin
      person[:age] = 31
    rescue => e
      puts e.message  # => "can't modify frozen Hash"
    end
    ```

2. **Using Immutable Data Structures**: Libraries like `Hamster` provide immutable data structures for Ruby. These structures return modified copies instead of altering the original.

    ```ruby
    require 'hamster'

    list = Hamster::Vector[1, 2, 3]
    new_list = list.add(4)

    puts list.inspect     # => Hamster::Vector[1, 2, 3]
    puts new_list.inspect # => Hamster::Vector[1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```

3. **Custom Immutable Classes**: You can design your classes to be immutable by not providing any methods that modify the state of the object after its creation.

    ```ruby
    class ImmutablePoint
      attr_reader :x, :y

      def initialize(x, y)
        @x, @y = x, y
        freeze
      end
    end

    point = ImmutablePoint.new(10, 20)
    # point.x = 15  # This will raise an error
    ```

### Advantages of Immutable Data Structures

1. **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe since their state cannot change. This eliminates the need for synchronization mechanisms, reducing complexity in concurrent applications.

2. **Predictability**: With immutable data, you can be confident that the state of an object will not change unexpectedly, leading to more predictable code behavior.

3. **Ease of Testing**: Immutable objects simplify testing because they eliminate side effects, making it easier to reason about the code and write tests.

4. **Functional Programming Compatibility**: Immutability aligns well with functional programming paradigms, allowing for easier adoption of functional techniques in Ruby.

### Exploring Functional Purity

**Functional Purity** refers to functions that have no side effects and return the same output for the same input. Pure functions are deterministic and do not depend on or modify any state outside their scope.

#### Characteristics of Pure Functions

- **Deterministic**: Given the same inputs, a pure function will always return the same output.
- **No Side Effects**: Pure functions do not alter any external state or rely on it.

#### Examples of Pure vs. Impure Functions

Let's illustrate the difference between pure and impure functions with examples:

**Pure Function Example**:

```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end

puts add(2, 3)  # => 5
puts add(2, 3)  # => 5 (always returns the same result)
```

**Impure Function Example**:

```ruby
total = 0

def add_to_total(value)
  total += value
end

puts add_to_total(5)  # => 5
puts add_to_total(5)  # => 10 (result depends on external state)
```

In the impure function example, the function `add_to_total` modifies the external variable `total`, making it impure.

### Benefits of Functional Purity

1. **Easier Testing**: Pure functions are easier to test because they do not depend on external state. You can test them in isolation with various inputs.

2. **Improved Readability**: Pure functions are self-contained and easier to understand, as they do not have hidden dependencies or side effects.

3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Since pure functions do not rely on external state, they can be reused in different contexts without unintended consequences.

4. **Facilitates Refactoring**: Pure functions make refactoring safer and more straightforward, as they are less likely to introduce bugs when moved or modified.

### Implementing Immutability and Functional Purity in Ruby

To effectively implement immutability and functional purity in Ruby, consider the following strategies:

1. **Adopt a Functional Mindset**: Embrace functional programming principles by treating functions as first-class citizens and focusing on immutability.

2. **Use Immutable Data Structures**: Leverage libraries like `Hamster` or design your immutable classes to ensure data cannot be modified after creation.

3. **Write Pure Functions**: Strive to write functions that do not depend on or modify external state. Use inputs and return values to pass data.

4. **Refactor Impure Code**: Identify impure functions in your codebase and refactor them to be pure, reducing dependencies on external state.

### Visualizing Immutability and Functional Purity

To better understand the concepts of immutability and functional purity, let's visualize them using a flowchart.

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[Create Immutable Object]
    B --> C[Attempt to Modify Object]
    C --> D{Is Object Mutable?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Modification Allowed]
    D -->|No| F[Modification Denied]
    E --> G[End]
    F --> G
```

**Figure 1**: This flowchart illustrates the process of creating an immutable object and attempting to modify it. If the object is immutable, the modification is denied.
