## 7.2 Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming, allowing developers to write more abstract, reusable, and concise code. In Ruby, higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This capability is a powerful tool for creating flexible and modular code.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are essential in functional programming languages, and Ruby, with its support for functional programming paradigms, makes it easy to leverage them. Let's break down the concept:

- **Definition**: A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.
- **Significance**: They enable developers to create more abstract and reusable code, allowing for operations like callbacks, decorators, and currying.

### Creating Higher-Order Functions in Ruby

Ruby provides several constructs to create higher-order functions, including blocks, Procs, and lambdas. Let's explore each of these:

#### Using Blocks

Blocks are a fundamental part of Ruby and are often used to implement higher-order functions. A block is a chunk of code enclosed between `do...end` or curly braces `{}`. Blocks can be passed to methods and executed within the method's context.

```ruby
# Example of a method that takes a block
def greet(name)
  yield(name) if block_given?
end

# Using the method with a block
greet("Alice") { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }
```

In this example, the `greet` method takes a block that is executed with the `yield` keyword. The block receives the `name` parameter and prints a greeting.

#### Using Procs

A `Proc` is an object that encapsulates a block of code, which can be stored in a variable and passed around. Procs are created using the `Proc.new` method or the `proc` method.

```ruby
# Creating a Proc
say_hello = Proc.new { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }

# Using the Proc
say_hello.call("Bob")
```

Procs provide more flexibility than blocks, as they can be stored in variables and reused multiple times.

#### Using Lambdas

Lambdas are similar to Procs but have some differences in behavior, particularly in terms of argument handling and return behavior. Lambdas are created using the `lambda` method or the `->` syntax.

```ruby
# Creating a lambda
say_hello = lambda { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }

# Using the lambda
say_hello.call("Charlie")
```

Lambdas check the number of arguments passed to them and will raise an error if the wrong number of arguments is provided. They also return control to the calling method when a `return` statement is executed, unlike Procs, which exit the method entirely.

### Use Cases for Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions have numerous applications in Ruby, including:

#### Callbacks

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed at a specific point in the execution flow. They are commonly used in event-driven programming and asynchronous operations.

```ruby
def perform_task(callback)
  puts "Performing task..."
  callback.call
end

# Defining a callback
task_completed = lambda { puts "Task completed!" }

# Using the callback
perform_task(task_completed)
```

#### Decorators

Decorators are higher-order functions that modify the behavior of other functions. They are useful for adding functionality to existing methods without altering their code.

```ruby
def log_execution(proc)
  lambda do |*args|
    puts "Starting execution..."
    result = proc.call(*args)
    puts "Execution finished."
    result
  end
end

# Original function
say_hello = lambda { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }

# Decorating the function
decorated_say_hello = log_execution(say_hello)

# Using the decorated function
decorated_say_hello.call("Dave")
```

#### Currying

Currying is a technique where a function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. Ruby supports currying with Procs and lambdas.

```ruby
# Creating a curried function
multiply = ->(x, y) { x * y }.curry

# Partially applying the function
double = multiply.call(2)

# Using the partially applied function
puts double.call(5) # Output: 10
```

Currying allows for the creation of specialized functions from more general ones, enhancing code reuse and modularity.

### Benefits of Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions offer several advantages:

- **Code Reuse**: By abstracting common patterns into higher-order functions, you can reuse code across different parts of your application.
- **Abstraction**: They allow you to abstract away details, focusing on the high-level logic of your code.
- **Flexibility**: Higher-order functions enable you to create flexible APIs that can be extended with custom behavior.

### Visualizing Higher-Order Functions

To better understand how higher-order functions work, let's visualize the flow of a higher-order function using a simple diagram.

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[Define Higher-Order Function]
    B --> C[Pass Function as Argument]
    C --> D[Execute Passed Function]
    D --> E[Return Result]
    E --> F[End]
```

This diagram illustrates the process of defining a higher-order function, passing a function as an argument, executing it, and returning the result.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with higher-order functions by modifying the examples provided. Try creating your own higher-order functions and see how they can simplify your code.

- **Modify the `greet` method** to take multiple blocks and execute them in sequence.
- **Create a higher-order function** that takes a list of functions and executes them in order.
- **Experiment with currying** by creating a curried function that adds three numbers.
