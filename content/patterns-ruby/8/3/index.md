## 8.3 `method_missing` and Dynamic Dispatch

In the world of Ruby, metaprogramming is a powerful tool that allows developers to write flexible and dynamic code. One of the key features that enable this flexibility is the `method_missing` hook. This hook allows Ruby objects to intercept calls to undefined methods, providing a mechanism to handle these calls dynamically or delegate them elsewhere. In this section, we will explore how `method_missing` works, how to implement it, and best practices for using it effectively.

### Understanding `method_missing`

The `method_missing` method is a special hook in Ruby that is called whenever an object receives a message (method call) it does not know how to handle. By overriding this method, you can define custom behavior for handling undefined method calls.

#### How `method_missing` Works

When you call a method on an object, Ruby follows a method lookup path to find the method definition. If Ruby cannot find the method, it calls `method_missing` on the object, passing the method name and any arguments.

Here's a simple example to illustrate this:

```ruby
class DynamicResponder
  def method_missing(method_name, *args, &block)
    puts "You tried to call: #{method_name} with arguments: #{args.inspect}"
  end
end

responder = DynamicResponder.new
responder.unknown_method('arg1', 'arg2')
```

**Output:**

```
You tried to call: unknown_method with arguments: ["arg1", "arg2"]
```

In this example, the `unknown_method` is not defined in the `DynamicResponder` class, so Ruby calls `method_missing`, which prints the method name and arguments.

### Implementing `method_missing` for Dynamic Methods

`method_missing` can be used to create dynamic methods that respond to a variety of method calls. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to create proxy objects or delegators.

#### Creating Proxy Objects

A proxy object acts as an intermediary for another object. You can use `method_missing` to forward method calls to the target object dynamically.

```ruby
class Proxy
  def initialize(target)
    @target = target
  end

  def method_missing(method_name, *args, &block)
    if @target.respond_to?(method_name)
      @target.public_send(method_name, *args, &block)
    else
      super
    end
  end

  def respond_to_missing?(method_name, include_private = false)
    @target.respond_to?(method_name, include_private) || super
  end
end

class Target
  def greet(name)
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end

target = Target.new
proxy = Proxy.new(target)
puts proxy.greet("World")  # Outputs: Hello, World!
```

In this example, the `Proxy` class forwards method calls to the `Target` object if it responds to the method. Otherwise, it calls `super`, which raises a `NoMethodError`.

#### Delegating Method Calls

You can also use `method_missing` to delegate method calls to another object, allowing for flexible and dynamic behavior.

```ruby
class Delegator
  def initialize(target)
    @target = target
  end

  def method_missing(method_name, *args, &block)
    @target.send(method_name, *args, &block)
  end

  def respond_to_missing?(method_name, include_private = false)
    @target.respond_to?(method_name, include_private)
  end
end

class Worker
  def perform(task)
    "Performing #{task}"
  end
end

worker = Worker.new
delegator = Delegator.new(worker)
puts delegator.perform("task")  # Outputs: Performing task
```

### Performance Implications

While `method_missing` is a powerful tool, it comes with performance considerations. Each call to `method_missing` incurs a performance penalty because Ruby has to go through the method lookup process before calling it. Therefore, it's important to use `method_missing` judiciously and only when necessary.

#### Importance of `respond_to_missing?`

When you override `method_missing`, it's crucial to also define `respond_to_missing?`. This method should return `true` if the object can respond to the given method name, even if it's handled by `method_missing`.

This is important for several reasons:

- **Introspection**: Tools like `Object#respond_to?` rely on `respond_to_missing?` to determine if an object can handle a method call.
- **Duck Typing**: Ruby's dynamic typing relies on objects responding to methods. Properly implementing `respond_to_missing?` ensures that your objects behave correctly in a dynamic environment.

### Best Practices for `method_missing`

To prevent unexpected behavior and maintain code quality, follow these best practices when using `method_missing`:

1. **Use Sparingly**: Only use `method_missing` when necessary. If you can define methods explicitly, do so.
2. **Define `respond_to_missing?`**: Always implement `respond_to_missing?` alongside `method_missing`.
3. **Call `super`**: If you cannot handle a method call, call `super` to allow Ruby to raise a `NoMethodError`.
4. **Document Behavior**: Clearly document the behavior of `method_missing` in your code to aid understanding and maintenance.
5. **Avoid Complex Logic**: Keep the logic in `method_missing` simple to avoid performance issues and bugs.

### Try It Yourself

To get a hands-on understanding of `method_missing`, try modifying the examples above:

- **Experiment with Arguments**: Modify the proxy example to handle methods with different numbers of arguments.
- **Add Logging**: Enhance the delegator example to log each method call before delegating it.
- **Create a Dynamic API**: Use `method_missing` to create a class that dynamically generates methods based on a configuration.

### Visualizing `method_missing` and Dynamic Dispatch

To better understand how `method_missing` fits into Ruby's method lookup process, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Object
    participant MethodMissing

    Caller->>Object: Call undefined method
    Object->>MethodMissing: method_missing
    MethodMissing-->>Caller: Handle method call
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of a method call to an undefined method. The `Caller` attempts to call a method on the `Object`. Since the method is undefined, the call is intercepted by `method_missing`, which handles the call.
