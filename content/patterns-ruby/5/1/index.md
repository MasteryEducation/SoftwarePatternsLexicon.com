## 5.1 Adapter Pattern

### Introduction

In the world of software development, we often encounter situations where we need to integrate components with incompatible interfaces. The Adapter Pattern, a structural design pattern, provides a solution by allowing objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge, converting the interface of one class into another expected by clients. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to reuse existing code without modifying it.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter Pattern is to allow classes with incompatible interfaces to work together. By creating an adapter, you can convert the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern promotes flexibility and reuse by enabling the integration of disparate systems.

### Problem Statement

Imagine you are developing a Ruby application that needs to integrate with a third-party library. The library provides a set of classes with interfaces that do not match the ones used in your application. Modifying the existing code to accommodate the library's interfaces can be time-consuming and error-prone. The Adapter Pattern offers a clean solution by allowing you to create an adapter that translates the library's interface into one that your application can understand.

### Key Participants

1. **Target Interface**: The interface that the client expects.
2. **Client**: The class that interacts with the target interface.
3. **Adaptee**: The class with an incompatible interface that needs to be adapted.
4. **Adapter**: The class that bridges the gap between the target interface and the adaptee.

### Applicability

Use the Adapter Pattern when:

- You want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- You need to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
- You want to integrate a third-party library into your application without modifying its source code.

### Class Adapter in Ruby

In Ruby, a class adapter can be implemented using inheritance. The adapter class inherits from the adaptee and implements the target interface. Here's an example:

```ruby
# Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class LegacyPrinter
  def print_legacy(text)
    puts "Printing in legacy format: #{text}"
  end
end

# Target interface
module Printer
  def print(text)
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"
  end
end

# Adapter class
class PrinterAdapter < LegacyPrinter
  include Printer

  def print(text)
    print_legacy(text)
  end
end

# Client code
def client_code(printer)
  printer.print("Hello, World!")
end

adapter = PrinterAdapter.new
client_code(adapter)
```

In this example, `LegacyPrinter` is the adaptee with an incompatible interface. The `PrinterAdapter` class inherits from `LegacyPrinter` and implements the `Printer` module, adapting the `print_legacy` method to the `print` method expected by the client.

### Object Adapter in Ruby

An object adapter uses composition instead of inheritance. The adapter holds an instance of the adaptee and delegates calls to it. Here's how you can implement an object adapter:

```ruby
# Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class LegacyPrinter
  def print_legacy(text)
    puts "Printing in legacy format: #{text}"
  end
end

# Target interface
module Printer
  def print(text)
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"
  end
end

# Adapter class
class PrinterAdapter
  include Printer

  def initialize(legacy_printer)
    @legacy_printer = legacy_printer
  end

  def print(text)
    @legacy_printer.print_legacy(text)
  end
end

# Client code
def client_code(printer)
  printer.print("Hello, World!")
end

legacy_printer = LegacyPrinter.new
adapter = PrinterAdapter.new(legacy_printer)
client_code(adapter)
```

In this example, the `PrinterAdapter` class holds an instance of `LegacyPrinter` and delegates the `print` method to `print_legacy`.

### Using Modules and Mixins

Ruby's modules and mixins provide a powerful way to implement adapters. By including a module in a class, you can dynamically add behavior to the class. Here's an example:

```ruby
# Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class LegacyPrinter
  def print_legacy(text)
    puts "Printing in legacy format: #{text}"
  end
end

# Adapter module
module PrinterAdapter
  def print(text)
    print_legacy(text)
  end
end

# Extend the adaptee with the adapter module
legacy_printer = LegacyPrinter.new
legacy_printer.extend(PrinterAdapter)

# Client code
def client_code(printer)
  printer.print("Hello, World!")
end

client_code(legacy_printer)
```

In this example, the `PrinterAdapter` module is mixed into an instance of `LegacyPrinter`, allowing it to respond to the `print` method.

### Benefits of the Adapter Pattern

- **Increased Flexibility**: The Adapter Pattern allows you to integrate components with incompatible interfaces without modifying their source code.
- **Code Reuse**: By adapting existing classes, you can reuse them in new contexts.
- **Decoupling**: The pattern decouples the client from the adaptee, promoting a more modular design.

### Design Considerations

- **Performance Overhead**: Adapters can introduce a slight performance overhead due to the additional layer of abstraction.
- **Complexity**: Overusing adapters can lead to increased complexity in the codebase.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the adapter correctly translates between the target interface and the adaptee.

### Ruby Unique Features

Ruby's dynamic nature and support for modules and mixins make it particularly well-suited for implementing adapters. The ability to extend objects at runtime provides a flexible way to adapt interfaces without modifying existing code.

### Differences and Similarities

The Adapter Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both patterns involve wrapping an object, the Adapter Pattern focuses on interface compatibility, whereas the Decorator Pattern adds new behavior to an object.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Client {
        +print(text)
    }
    class PrinterAdapter {
        +print(text)
    }
    class LegacyPrinter {
        +print_legacy(text)
    }
    Client --> PrinterAdapter : uses
    PrinterAdapter --> LegacyPrinter : adapts
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the client, adapter, and adaptee. The client interacts with the adapter, which in turn adapts the interface of the adaptee.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying the `LegacyPrinter` class to include additional methods. Create new adapters to translate these methods into the target interface. This exercise will help you understand how the Adapter Pattern can be applied in different scenarios.
