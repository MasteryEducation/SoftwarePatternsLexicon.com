## 24.6 Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are pivotal practices in modern software development, especially when building scalable and maintainable Ruby applications. By automating the processes of building, testing, and deploying code, CI/CD enhances deployment efficiency and reliability, allowing developers to focus on writing quality code. In this section, we will delve into the concepts of CI/CD, explore setting up pipelines with popular tools, and discuss best practices for automating tests, code quality checks, and deployments.

### Understanding CI/CD

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. The key objective is to detect integration bugs as early as possible, ensuring that the software is always in a state that can be released.

**Continuous Delivery (CD)** extends CI by ensuring that the software can be released to production at any time. It involves automating the release process so that deployments can be done quickly and safely.

**Continuous Deployment** is a step further, where every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline is released to customers automatically.

#### Benefits of CI/CD

- **Reduced Integration Risk**: By integrating frequently, you reduce the risk of integration issues.
- **Faster Time to Market**: Automating the deployment process allows for faster and more frequent releases.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing and code quality checks ensure that only high-quality code is deployed.
- **Increased Developer Productivity**: Developers can focus on writing code rather than managing deployments.

### Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines

Let's explore how to set up CI/CD pipelines using popular tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Jenkins.

#### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool integrated directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying your code.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ruby.yml
name: Ruby CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: 3.0
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: bundle install
    - name: Run tests
      run: bundle exec rspec
```

In this example, we define a workflow that runs on every push or pull request to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, sets up Ruby, installs dependencies, and runs tests using RSpec.

#### CircleCI

CircleCI is another popular CI/CD tool that provides a robust platform for automating your build, test, and deployment processes.

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml
version: 2.1

executors:
  ruby-executor:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:3.0

jobs:
  test:
    executor: ruby-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: bundle install
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: bundle exec rspec

workflows:
  version: 2
  test_and_deploy:
    jobs:
      - test
```

This configuration sets up a CircleCI pipeline that uses a Docker image with Ruby 3.0, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

#### Jenkins

Jenkins is a widely-used open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating any project.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'bundle install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'bundle exec rspec'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'cap production deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Jenkins pipeline script defines three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. It uses shell commands to install dependencies, run tests, and deploy the application.

### Automating Tests and Code Quality Checks

Automating tests and code quality checks is crucial in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that only high-quality code is deployed.

- **Unit Tests**: Use tools like RSpec or Minitest to write and run unit tests.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that different parts of your application work together as expected.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Use tools like RuboCop to enforce coding standards and detect code smells.

```yaml
# Example of adding RuboCop to GitHub Actions
- name: Run RuboCop
  run: bundle exec rubocop
```

### Deployment Strategies

Understanding deployment strategies is essential for implementing effective CI/CD pipelines.

#### Continuous Deployment vs. Continuous Delivery

- **Continuous Deployment**: Every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline is automatically deployed to production.
- **Continuous Delivery**: The deployment process is automated, but requires a manual trigger to deploy to production.

#### Environment Configuration and Secrets Management

Managing environment configurations and secrets securely is critical in CI/CD pipelines.

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to configure your application for different environments.
- **Secrets Management**: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to store and manage sensitive information.

### Best Practices for CI/CD

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use tools like Terraform or Ansible to manage your infrastructure as code.
- **Immutable Deployments**: Deploy applications in a way that ensures the environment is consistent and unchangeable.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of your applications.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the CI/CD pipelines by modifying the examples provided. Try adding additional steps, such as deploying to a staging environment or running additional tests.

### Visualizing CI/CD Pipelines
