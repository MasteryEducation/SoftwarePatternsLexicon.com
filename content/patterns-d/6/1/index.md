## 6.1 Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it, promoting flexibility and reusability in code design.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the client to choose which algorithm to use at runtime, without altering the client code. It is particularly useful when you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to switch between them easily.

### Key Participants

1. **Strategy Interface**: Declares an interface common to all supported algorithms. The `Context` uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a `ConcreteStrategy`.
2. **ConcreteStrategy**: Implements the algorithm using the `Strategy` interface.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a `Strategy` object and is configured with a `ConcreteStrategy` object. It may define an interface that lets `Strategy` access its data.

### Applicability

Use the Strategy Pattern when:
- You have multiple related classes that differ only in their behavior.
- You need different variants of an algorithm.
- An algorithm uses data that clients should not know about.
- A class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations.

### Implementing Strategy in D

#### Interfaces and Delegates

In D, interfaces and delegates can be used to define strategies. Interfaces provide a way to define a contract for the strategies, while delegates allow for more flexible function pointers.

**Example: Sorting Algorithms**

Let's consider a scenario where we have different sorting algorithms, and we want to choose one at runtime.

```d
interface SortStrategy {
    void sort(int[] data);
}

class BubbleSort : SortStrategy {
    override void sort(int[] data) {
        // Bubble sort implementation
        for (size_t i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            for (size_t j = 0; j < data.length - i - 1; j++) {
                if (data[j] > data[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = data[j];
                    data[j] = data[j + 1];
                    data[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

class QuickSort : SortStrategy {
    override void sort(int[] data) {
        // Quick sort implementation
        quickSort(data, 0, data.length - 1);
    }

    private void quickSort(int[] data, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(data, low, high);
            quickSort(data, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(data, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private int partition(int[] data, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = data[high];
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
            if (data[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                int temp = data[i];
                data[i] = data[j];
                data[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        int temp = data[i + 1];
        data[i + 1] = data[high];
        data[high] = temp;
        return (i + 1);
    }
}

class Context {
    private SortStrategy strategy;

    void setStrategy(SortStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    void executeStrategy(int[] data) {
        strategy.sort(data);
    }
}

void main() {
    int[] data = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
    Context context = new Context();

    // Use BubbleSort
    context.setStrategy(new BubbleSort());
    context.executeStrategy(data);
    writeln("Sorted using BubbleSort: ", data);

    // Use QuickSort
    context.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
    context.executeStrategy(data);
    writeln("Sorted using QuickSort: ", data);
}
```

In this example, we define a `SortStrategy` interface and two concrete strategies: `BubbleSort` and `QuickSort`. The `Context` class uses these strategies to sort data.

#### Template Strategies

D's powerful template system allows for compile-time strategy selection, providing a way to choose strategies without runtime overhead.

**Example: Template-Based Strategy**

```d
template SortStrategy(T) {
    void sort(T[] data) {
        static if (is(T == int)) {
            // Use QuickSort for integers
            quickSort(data, 0, data.length - 1);
        } else {
            // Use BubbleSort for other types
            bubbleSort(data);
        }
    }

    private void quickSort(T[] data, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(data, low, high);
            quickSort(data, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(data, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private int partition(T[] data, int low, int high) {
        T pivot = data[high];
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
            if (data[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                T temp = data[i];
                data[i] = data[j];
                data[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        T temp = data[i + 1];
        data[i + 1] = data[high];
        data[high] = temp;
        return (i + 1);
    }

    private void bubbleSort(T[] data) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            for (size_t j = 0; j < data.length - i - 1; j++) {
                if (data[j] > data[j + 1]) {
                    T temp = data[j];
                    data[j] = data[j + 1];
                    data[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

void main() {
    int[] intData = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
    SortStrategy!(int).sort(intData);
    writeln("Sorted integers: ", intData);

    float[] floatData = [64.5, 34.2, 25.1, 12.3, 22.4, 11.5, 90.6];
    SortStrategy!(float).sort(floatData);
    writeln("Sorted floats: ", floatData);
}
```

In this example, we use a template to define a sorting strategy that selects the appropriate algorithm based on the data type.

#### Dynamic Selection

Dynamic selection allows switching strategies at runtime based on conditions, providing flexibility in choosing the most suitable algorithm for the current context.

**Example: Dynamic Strategy Selection**

```d
import std.stdio;

interface CompressionStrategy {
    void compress(string data);
}

class ZipCompression : CompressionStrategy {
    override void compress(string data) {
        writeln("Compressing using ZIP: ", data);
    }
}

class RarCompression : CompressionStrategy {
    override void compress(string data) {
        writeln("Compressing using RAR: ", data);
    }
}

class CompressionContext {
    private CompressionStrategy strategy;

    void setStrategy(CompressionStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    void executeStrategy(string data) {
        strategy.compress(data);
    }
}

void main() {
    CompressionContext context = new CompressionContext();
    string data = "Example data to compress";

    // Choose strategy based on some condition
    bool useZip = true; // This could be a runtime condition
    if (useZip) {
        context.setStrategy(new ZipCompression());
    } else {
        context.setStrategy(new RarCompression());
    }

    context.executeStrategy(data);
}
```

In this example, we dynamically select a compression strategy based on a condition, allowing flexibility in choosing the algorithm at runtime.

### Design Considerations

- **Flexibility**: The Strategy Pattern provides flexibility in choosing algorithms, making it easy to switch between them without altering the client code.
- **Encapsulation**: By encapsulating algorithms, the pattern promotes separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable.
- **Overhead**: Be mindful of the overhead introduced by using interfaces and dynamic dispatch. Consider using templates for compile-time strategy selection when performance is critical.
- **D-Specific Features**: Leverage D's powerful template system and compile-time features to optimize strategy selection and reduce runtime overhead.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Strategy vs. State Pattern**: Both patterns involve changing behavior at runtime. However, the Strategy Pattern focuses on interchangeable algorithms, while the State Pattern is about changing an object's behavior when its state changes.
- **Strategy vs. Template Method Pattern**: The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses. In contrast, the Strategy Pattern allows the entire algorithm to be replaced.

### Visualizing Strategy Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        -Strategy strategy
        +setStrategy(Strategy strategy)
        +executeStrategy()
    }
    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        +algorithmInterface()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        +algorithmInterface()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        +algorithmInterface()
    }
    Context --> Strategy
    Strategy <|.. ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|.. ConcreteStrategyB
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Context`, `Strategy`, and `ConcreteStrategy` classes. The `Context` maintains a reference to a `Strategy` and delegates the algorithm execution to the `ConcreteStrategy`.
