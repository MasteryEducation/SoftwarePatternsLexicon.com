## 21.1 Glossary of Terms

In this section, we provide a comprehensive glossary of terms used throughout the guide. This glossary is designed to help you understand the key concepts, acronyms, and abbreviations that are essential for mastering design patterns in the D programming language, particularly in the context of advanced systems programming.

### A

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is used to create a set of related objects that share a common theme.

- **Actor Model**: A conceptual model for dealing with concurrent computation. In the actor model, "actors" are the universal primitives of concurrent computation. They can make local decisions, create more actors, send messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received.

- **Alias**: In D, `alias` is used to create a new name for an existing type or symbol. It is often used in metaprogramming to simplify code and improve readability.

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. It defines the way software components should interact.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: A programming paradigm that allows for the execution of tasks independently of the main program flow, often used to improve performance by allowing other operations to continue before the previous ones have finished.

### B

- **Behavioral Design Patterns**: Patterns that focus on communication between objects, defining how objects interact in a way that increases flexibility in carrying out communication.

- **Builder Pattern**: A creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### C

- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled.

- **Class**: In D, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

- **Compile-Time Function Execution (CTFE)**: A feature in D that allows functions to be executed at compile time, enabling more efficient code by performing computations during compilation rather than at runtime.

- **Concurrency**: The ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, often used to improve performance and responsiveness.

- **Creational Design Patterns**: Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### D

- **Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern**: A structural pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism.

- **Data Transfer Object (DTO) Pattern**: A pattern used to transfer data between software application subsystems, often used to reduce the number of method calls.

- **Decorator Pattern**: A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

- **Dependency Injection Pattern**: A design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class in different ways.

- **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**: A computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language, which is broadly applicable across domains.

### E

- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

- **Event-Driven Programming**: A programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs.

### H

- **Higher-Order Function**: A function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.

### I

- **Immutability**: The state of an object cannot be modified after it is created. Immutability is a core concept in functional programming.

- **Inheritance**: A mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class.

- **Iterator Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### J

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

### K

- **Kernel Module**: A piece of code that can be loaded into the kernel to extend its functionality, often used in systems programming.

### L

- **Lazy Evaluation**: A strategy that delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

- **Lock-Free Programming**: A type of concurrent programming that avoids the use of locks, reducing the risk of deadlock and improving performance.

### M

- **Mediator Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

- **Memoization**: An optimization technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

- **Metaprogramming**: A programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data, allowing a program to be designed to read, generate, analyze, or transform other programs.

- **Mixin**: A class that provides methods that can be used by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes.

### N

- **Namespace**: A container that holds a set of identifiers and allows the disambiguation of homonym identifiers residing in different namespaces.

- **Network Programming**: The practice of writing computer programs that communicate with other programs across a computer network.

### O

- **Observer Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

- **Object Pool Pattern**: A creational design pattern that uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use, rather than allocating and destroying them on demand.

### P

- **Parallelism**: The simultaneous execution of multiple computations, often used to improve performance by dividing a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be processed concurrently.

- **Polymorphism**: The provision of a single interface to entities of different types, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

- **Prototype Pattern**: A creational design pattern that allows cloning of objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

- **Proxy Pattern**: A structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object, controlling access to it.

### Q

- **Queue**: A collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end.

### R

- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: A programming idiom used in several object-oriented languages, particularly C++, where resources are tied to the lifespan of objects.

- **Reflection**: The ability of a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.

- **Repository Pattern**: A structural pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.

### S

- **Scope Guard**: A programming construct that ensures that resources are released when they go out of scope, often used to manage resource cleanup.

- **Service Locator Pattern**: A design pattern used to encapsulate the processes involved in obtaining a service with a strong abstraction layer.

- **Singleton Pattern**: A creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance.

- **Slice**: A data structure in D that represents a contiguous sequence of elements, often used for efficient array manipulation.

- **State Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

- **Strategy Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

- **Structural Design Patterns**: Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

### T

- **Template**: A feature in D that allows functions and types to operate with generic types, enabling code reuse and flexibility.

- **Thread**: The smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler.

- **Traits**: A mechanism in D for compile-time reflection, allowing you to query properties of types and symbols.

### U

- **Unit of Work Pattern**: A design pattern that maintains a list of business objects that have been changed during a transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes and the resolution of concurrency problems.

- **Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS)**: A feature in D that allows functions to be called as if they were member functions, providing a more consistent and readable syntax.

### V

- **Visitor Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
