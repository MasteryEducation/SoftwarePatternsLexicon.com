## 5.4 Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to add responsibilities to objects without modifying their code, thus adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the Decorator Pattern is to provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. By using this pattern, you can add new functionality to an object without altering its structure, which is especially beneficial in systems programming where flexibility and performance are crucial.

### Implementing Decorator in D

In the D programming language, implementing the Decorator Pattern involves creating a component interface that both the original object and the decorators will implement. Decorator classes are then used to wrap these components and add new functionality.

#### Component Interface

The component interface defines the methods that will be implemented by both the concrete component and the decorators. This ensures that the decorators can be used interchangeably with the original object.

```d
interface Coffee {
    double cost();
    string description();
}
```

#### Concrete Component

The concrete component is the original object to which new behavior will be added.

```d
class BasicCoffee : Coffee {
    double cost() {
        return 2.0;
    }

    string description() {
        return "Basic Coffee";
    }
}
```

#### Decorator Classes

Decorator classes implement the component interface and contain a reference to a component object. They add new behavior by calling the methods of the component object and then adding something extra.

```d
class CoffeeDecorator : Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    this(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    double cost() {
        return coffee.cost();
    }

    string description() {
        return coffee.description();
    }
}

class MilkDecorator : CoffeeDecorator {
    this(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 0.5;
    }

    string description() {
        return super.description() ~ ", Milk";
    }
}

class SugarDecorator : CoffeeDecorator {
    this(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 0.2;
    }

    string description() {
        return super.description() ~ ", Sugar";
    }
}
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Decorator Pattern is versatile and can be used in various scenarios, such as enhancing objects with additional features like logging, security checks, or even graphical elements in a UI.

#### Enhancing Objects

Consider a scenario where you need to add logging to a component. Instead of modifying the component's code, you can create a decorator that adds logging functionality.

```d
class LoggingDecorator : CoffeeDecorator {
    this(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    double cost() {
        writeln("Calculating cost...");
        return super.cost();
    }

    string description() {
        return super.description();
    }
}
```

#### Flexible Designs

The Decorator Pattern allows behaviors to be mixed and matched at runtime, providing a flexible design that can adapt to changing requirements.

```d
void main() {
    Coffee myCoffee = new BasicCoffee();
    myCoffee = new MilkDecorator(myCoffee);
    myCoffee = new SugarDecorator(myCoffee);
    myCoffee = new LoggingDecorator(myCoffee);

    writeln("Cost: ", myCoffee.cost());
    writeln("Description: ", myCoffee.description());
}
```

### Visualizing the Decorator Pattern

To better understand the structure of the Decorator Pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Coffee {
        <<interface>>
        +cost() : double
        +description() : string
    }
    
    class BasicCoffee {
        +cost() : double
        +description() : string
    }
    
    class CoffeeDecorator {
        -Coffee coffee
        +cost() : double
        +description() : string
    }
    
    class MilkDecorator {
        +cost() : double
        +description() : string
    }
    
    class SugarDecorator {
        +cost() : double
        +description() : string
    }
    
    class LoggingDecorator {
        +cost() : double
        +description() : string
    }
    
    Coffee <|-- BasicCoffee
    Coffee <|-- CoffeeDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- MilkDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- SugarDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- LoggingDecorator
```

### Key Participants

- **Component**: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
- **ConcreteComponent**: The original object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
- **Decorator**: Maintains a reference to a component object and defines an interface that conforms to the component's interface.
- **ConcreteDecorator**: Adds responsibilities to the component.

### Applicability

Use the Decorator Pattern when:

- You need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
- You want to avoid a feature-laden class hierarchy by creating a set of decorator classes for each feature.
- You need to extend the functionality of a class in a flexible and reusable way.

### Design Considerations

When using the Decorator Pattern in D, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Each layer of decoration adds a level of indirection, which can impact performance. Use this pattern judiciously in performance-critical applications.
- **Complexity**: Decorators can lead to a system with many small objects that are difficult to understand and maintain.
- **D-Specific Features**: Leverage D's mixins and templates to create more flexible and reusable decorators.

### Differences and Similarities

The Decorator Pattern is often confused with the Proxy Pattern. While both involve a level of indirection, the Proxy Pattern controls access to an object, whereas the Decorator Pattern adds behavior to an object.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by:

- Adding new decorators, such as a `VanillaDecorator` or `CaramelDecorator`.
- Modifying existing decorators to change their behavior.
- Creating a decorator that combines multiple functionalities, such as a `MochaDecorator` that adds both chocolate and milk.
