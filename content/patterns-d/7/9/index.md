## 7.9 Safe, Trusted, and System Code Best Practices

In the realm of systems programming, ensuring code safety while maintaining performance is paramount. The D programming language offers a unique approach to code safety through its attributes: `@safe`, `@trusted`, and `@system`. These attributes allow developers to explicitly define the safety level of their code, providing a robust framework for managing memory safety and low-level operations. In this section, we will explore these safety levels in detail, discuss best practices for their use, and provide practical examples to illustrate their application.

### Code Safety Levels in D

D's safety attributes are designed to help developers write safe and efficient code by clearly delineating the boundaries of memory safety. Let's delve into each of these attributes:

#### `@safe`: Guaranteeing Memory Safety

The `@safe` attribute is the cornerstone of D's safety model. It ensures that the code marked as `@safe` cannot perform any operations that could lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior. This includes preventing:

- Pointer arithmetic
- Casting pointers to integers and vice versa
- Accessing union members that are not currently active
- Calling `@system` functions

By using `@safe`, developers can guarantee that their code is free from common memory safety issues, such as buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences.

```d
// Example of @safe function
@safe int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In the above example, the `add` function is marked as `@safe`, ensuring that it adheres to D's memory safety rules.

#### `@trusted`: Marking Code as Safe Despite Potential Risks

The `@trusted` attribute is used to mark code that is inherently unsafe but has been manually verified to be safe. This is useful when interfacing with low-level operations or external libraries where safety cannot be automatically guaranteed by the compiler.

```d
// Example of @trusted function
@trusted void copyMemory(void* dest, const void* src, size_t size) {
    import core.stdc.string : memcpy;
    memcpy(dest, src, size);
}
```

In this example, the `copyMemory` function uses the C standard library's `memcpy` function, which is inherently unsafe. By marking it as `@trusted`, we assert that the function is safe to use, provided it is called with valid arguments.

#### `@system`: Allowing Low-Level Operations

The `@system` attribute is the default safety level in D and allows for low-level operations that are not checked for safety. This includes pointer arithmetic and direct memory manipulation. While `@system` code is powerful, it should be used judiciously to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

```d
// Example of @system function
@system void manipulatePointer(int* ptr) {
    *ptr += 1; // Direct memory manipulation
}
```

The `manipulatePointer` function demonstrates a simple use of `@system` code, where direct pointer manipulation is performed.

### Best Practices for Using Safety Attributes

To effectively leverage D's safety attributes, consider the following best practices:

#### Minimizing `@system` Code

- **Isolate Unsafe Operations**: Encapsulate `@system` code within small, well-defined functions. This makes it easier to audit and verify the safety of these operations.
- **Use `@trusted` Sparingly**: Only use `@trusted` when absolutely necessary, and ensure that the code has been thoroughly reviewed for safety.
- **Prefer `@safe` by Default**: Aim to write `@safe` code whenever possible. This not only improves code safety but also enhances maintainability and readability.

#### Use Cases and Examples

Let's explore some common use cases where these safety attributes are particularly useful:

##### Interoperability: Calling C Functions Safely

When interfacing with C libraries, it's often necessary to use `@trusted` or `@system` code. However, by wrapping these calls in `@trusted` functions, you can maintain safety while leveraging external functionality.

```d
// Example of calling a C function safely
@trusted int callCFunction(int a, int b) {
    extern(C) int cFunction(int, int);
    return cFunction(a, b);
}
```

In this example, the `callCFunction` function wraps a call to a C function, ensuring that the rest of the D code remains `@safe`.

##### Performance-Critical Sections: Using Low-Level Code Judiciously

In performance-critical sections, it may be necessary to use `@system` code for optimization purposes. However, it's important to balance performance gains with safety considerations.

```d
// Example of performance-critical code
@system void fastCopy(int* dest, const int* src, size_t count) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        dest[i] = src[i];
    }
}
```

The `fastCopy` function demonstrates a scenario where `@system` code is used to optimize memory copying operations.

### Visualizing Safety Levels

To better understand the relationship between these safety levels, let's visualize them using a diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[@safe] --> B[@trusted]
    B --> C[@system]
    C --> D[Low-Level Operations]
    A --> E[Memory Safety]
    B --> E
    C --> E
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the hierarchy of safety levels in D. `@safe` ensures memory safety, `@trusted` is used for verified safe code, and `@system` allows low-level operations.
