## 3.10 Set Operators: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT

In the realm of SQL, set operators are powerful tools that allow us to perform operations on multiple result sets, much like set operations in mathematics. They enable us to combine, intersect, and differentiate data sets, providing a versatile approach to data manipulation. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of three primary set operators: **UNION**, **INTERSECT**, and **EXCEPT**. We will explore their syntax, use cases, and best practices, along with practical examples to solidify your understanding.

### Understanding Set Operators

Set operators in SQL are used to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result set. The key operators include:

- **UNION**: Combines the results of two queries, removing duplicates by default.
- **INTERSECT**: Returns only the rows that are common to both queries.
- **EXCEPT**: Returns rows from the first query that are not present in the second query.

#### Compatibility Requirements

Before diving into each operator, it's important to understand the compatibility requirements for using set operators:

1. **Matching Column Count**: The queries combined by set operators must have the same number of columns in their result sets.
2. **Compatible Data Types**: The corresponding columns in the queries must have compatible data types. For example, you cannot combine a column of type `VARCHAR` with a column of type `INTEGER`.

### UNION Operator

The **UNION** operator is used to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result set. By default, it removes duplicate rows from the result set.

#### UNION ALL vs. UNION DISTINCT

- **UNION ALL**: Combines the results of two queries and includes all duplicates.
- **UNION DISTINCT**: Removes duplicates from the combined result set. This is the default behavior of the UNION operator.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION [ALL | DISTINCT]
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

#### Example: UNION ALL

Let's consider two tables, `employees_us` and `employees_uk`, which store employee data for US and UK offices, respectively.

```sql
-- Combine employee data from both US and UK offices, including duplicates
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees_us
UNION ALL
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees_uk;
```

In this example, `UNION ALL` combines the data from both tables, including any duplicate rows.

#### Example: UNION DISTINCT

```sql
-- Combine employee data from both US and UK offices, removing duplicates
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees_us
UNION
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees_uk;
```

Here, `UNION` (equivalent to `UNION DISTINCT`) removes duplicate rows from the combined result set.

### INTERSECT Operator

The **INTERSECT** operator returns only the rows that are common to both queries. It is useful for finding overlapping data between two result sets.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

#### Example: INTERSECT

Suppose we have two tables, `project_a` and `project_b`, each containing a list of employee IDs working on different projects.

```sql
-- Find employees working on both Project A and Project B
SELECT employee_id
FROM project_a
INTERSECT
SELECT employee_id
FROM project_b;
```

This query returns the employee IDs that are present in both `project_a` and `project_b`.

### EXCEPT Operator

The **EXCEPT** operator returns rows from the first query that are not present in the second query. It is useful for identifying unique data in one result set compared to another.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

#### Example: EXCEPT

Consider two tables, `all_employees` and `terminated_employees`, where `all_employees` contains all current employees and `terminated_employees` contains employees who have left the company.

```sql
-- Find employees who are currently active (not terminated)
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM all_employees
EXCEPT
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM terminated_employees;
```

This query returns the employees who are still active and not present in the `terminated_employees` table.

### Visualizing Set Operations

To better understand how these set operators work, let's visualize the operations using a Venn diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Query 1 Result Set] -->|UNION| C[Combined Result Set];
    B[Query 2 Result Set] -->|UNION| C;
    A -->|INTERSECT| D[Common Rows];
    B -->|INTERSECT| D;
    A -->|EXCEPT| E[Unique to Query 1];
    B -->|EXCEPT| F[Unique to Query 2];
```

- **UNION**: Combines both result sets into one, removing duplicates.
- **INTERSECT**: Returns only the overlapping area (common rows).
- **EXCEPT**: Returns the part of the first set that does not overlap with the second.

### Best Practices for Using Set Operators

1. **Ensure Column Compatibility**: Always verify that the columns in the queries have compatible data types and the same number of columns.
2. **Use UNION ALL When Duplicates Are Acceptable**: If duplicates are acceptable and performance is a concern, prefer `UNION ALL` over `UNION` to avoid the overhead of duplicate removal.
3. **Optimize Queries for Performance**: Set operations can be resource-intensive. Ensure that the underlying queries are optimized for performance.
4. **Consider Indexing**: Proper indexing can significantly improve the performance of set operations, especially when dealing with large data sets.
5. **Use EXCEPT for Data Validation**: Use the `EXCEPT` operator to validate data by identifying discrepancies between expected and actual data sets.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following modifications to the code examples:

- Modify the `UNION` example to include additional columns and observe how it affects the result set.
- Change the `INTERSECT` example to use different tables and see how the common rows change.
- Use the `EXCEPT` operator with different conditions to explore its behavior with various data sets.
