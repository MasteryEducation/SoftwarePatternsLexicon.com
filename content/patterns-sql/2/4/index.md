## 2.4 Keys: Primary, Foreign, Unique, and Composite

In the realm of relational database design, keys play a pivotal role in ensuring data integrity, establishing relationships, and optimizing query performance. As expert software engineers and architects, understanding the nuances of different types of keys—primary, foreign, unique, and composite—is essential for crafting robust and efficient database solutions. In this section, we will delve into each type of key, exploring their purposes, implementation strategies, and best practices.

### Primary Keys

**Primary Keys** are the cornerstone of any relational database. They uniquely identify each record within a table, ensuring that no two rows have the same primary key value. Selecting the best candidate key for uniqueness is crucial for maintaining data integrity and optimizing database operations.

#### Design Pattern Name: Primary Key

- **Category**: Data Integrity
- **Intent**: To uniquely identify each record in a table, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval.

#### Key Participants

- **Table**: The entity that contains the data.
- **Column(s)**: The attribute(s) chosen to serve as the primary key.

#### Applicability

- Use a primary key when you need to ensure that each record in a table is unique.
- Ideal for tables where data integrity and efficient retrieval are paramount.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

> **Explanation**: In this example, `EmployeeID` is designated as the primary key, ensuring that each employee record is uniquely identifiable.

#### Design Considerations

- **Choosing the Right Key**: Select a column or set of columns that are inherently unique. Avoid using columns that may change over time, such as email addresses.
- **Auto-Increment**: Consider using auto-incrementing integers for primary keys to simplify key management.

#### Differences and Similarities

- **Primary vs. Unique Keys**: While both ensure uniqueness, a table can have only one primary key but multiple unique keys.

### Foreign Keys

**Foreign Keys** are instrumental in defining relationships between tables and enforcing referential integrity. They link records in one table to records in another, ensuring that relationships are maintained and data consistency is preserved.

#### Design Pattern Name: Foreign Key

- **Category**: Referential Integrity
- **Intent**: To establish and enforce relationships between tables, ensuring data consistency across related tables.

#### Key Participants

- **Parent Table**: The table containing the primary key.
- **Child Table**: The table containing the foreign key that references the primary key of the parent table.

#### Applicability

- Use foreign keys to define relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity.
- Ideal for databases where maintaining data consistency across related tables is critical.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);
```

> **Explanation**: Here, `DepartmentID` in the `Employees` table is a foreign key referencing the `DepartmentID` in the `Departments` table, establishing a relationship between employees and their respective departments.

#### Design Considerations

- **Cascading Actions**: Consider using cascading updates and deletes to automatically propagate changes across related tables.
- **Indexing**: Index foreign key columns to improve join performance.

#### Differences and Similarities

- **Foreign vs. Primary Keys**: Foreign keys reference primary keys in other tables, while primary keys uniquely identify records within their own table.

### Unique Keys

**Unique Keys** ensure that all values in a column are distinct, similar to primary keys, but with the flexibility of allowing multiple unique keys per table. They are essential for enforcing data integrity and preventing duplicate entries.

#### Design Pattern Name: Unique Key

- **Category**: Data Integrity
- **Intent**: To ensure that all values in a column or set of columns are unique, preventing duplicate entries.

#### Key Participants

- **Table**: The entity that contains the data.
- **Column(s)**: The attribute(s) chosen to enforce uniqueness.

#### Applicability

- Use unique keys to enforce data integrity and prevent duplicate entries in columns that are not primary keys.
- Ideal for columns that require uniqueness but are not suitable as primary keys.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

> **Explanation**: In this example, the `Email` column is defined as a unique key, ensuring that no two employees can have the same email address.

#### Design Considerations

- **Multiple Unique Keys**: A table can have multiple unique keys, each enforcing uniqueness on different columns.
- **Indexing**: Unique keys automatically create an index, improving query performance.

#### Differences and Similarities

- **Unique vs. Primary Keys**: Both enforce uniqueness, but a table can have only one primary key and multiple unique keys.

### Composite Keys

**Composite Keys** are used when a single column is insufficient to uniquely identify a record. By combining multiple columns, composite keys create a unique identifier for each record, ensuring data integrity in complex scenarios.

#### Design Pattern Name: Composite Key

- **Category**: Data Integrity
- **Intent**: To create a unique identifier for each record by combining multiple columns, ensuring data integrity in complex scenarios.

#### Key Participants

- **Table**: The entity that contains the data.
- **Columns**: The set of attributes combined to form the composite key.

#### Applicability

- Use composite keys when a single column is insufficient to uniquely identify a record.
- Ideal for tables with complex data structures requiring multiple attributes for uniqueness.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```sql
CREATE TABLE CourseRegistrations (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    RegistrationDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)
);
```

> **Explanation**: In this example, `StudentID` and `CourseID` together form a composite primary key, uniquely identifying each course registration.

#### Design Considerations

- **Complexity**: Composite keys can increase complexity, so use them judiciously.
- **Indexing**: Ensure that composite keys are indexed to maintain query performance.

#### Differences and Similarities

- **Composite vs. Single-Column Keys**: Composite keys combine multiple columns, while single-column keys rely on a single attribute for uniqueness.

### Natural vs. Surrogate Keys

When designing databases, a critical decision is whether to use natural keys, which are derived from real-world data, or surrogate keys, which are system-generated.

#### Natural Keys

- **Definition**: Keys derived from real-world data, such as Social Security Numbers or email addresses.
- **Advantages**: Intuitive and meaningful, often reducing the need for additional joins.
- **Disadvantages**: Can change over time, leading to maintenance challenges.

#### Surrogate Keys

- **Definition**: System-generated keys, often integers, used to uniquely identify records.
- **Advantages**: Stable and immutable, simplifying key management.
- **Disadvantages**: Lack of inherent meaning, requiring additional joins for context.

#### Design Considerations

- **When to Use Natural Keys**: Use natural keys when the data is inherently unique and unlikely to change.
- **When to Use Surrogate Keys**: Use surrogate keys when stability and immutability are priorities.

### Visualizing Key Relationships

To better understand the relationships between primary, foreign, unique, and composite keys, let's visualize these concepts using a diagram.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    EMPLOYEES {
        INT EmployeeID PK
        VARCHAR FirstName
        VARCHAR LastName
        VARCHAR Email UK
        INT DepartmentID FK
    }
    DEPARTMENTS {
        INT DepartmentID PK
        VARCHAR DepartmentName
    }
    COURSE_REGISTRATIONS {
        INT StudentID PK
        INT CourseID PK
        DATE RegistrationDate
    }
    EMPLOYEES ||--|{ DEPARTMENTS : "belongs to"
    COURSE_REGISTRATIONS }|--|| EMPLOYEES : "registered by"
```

> **Description**: This diagram illustrates the relationships between the `Employees`, `Departments`, and `CourseRegistrations` tables, highlighting the use of primary, foreign, unique, and composite keys.
