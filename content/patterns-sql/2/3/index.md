## 2.3 Data Integrity and Constraints

In the realm of relational databases, data integrity is paramount. It ensures that the data stored in a database is accurate, consistent, and reliable. Data integrity is maintained through a set of rules known as constraints. These constraints enforce the validity of the data and prevent the entry of incorrect or inconsistent data. In this section, we will delve into the various types of constraints available in SQL and how they contribute to maintaining data integrity.

### Understanding Data Integrity

Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle. It is a critical aspect of database design and management, ensuring that the data remains reliable and valid. Data integrity can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Entity Integrity**: Ensures that each entity (or row) in a table is uniquely identifiable.
2. **Referential Integrity**: Ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent.
3. **Domain Integrity**: Ensures that data entries fall within a specific domain or set of values.

### Types of Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity. Let's explore the different types of constraints in SQL:

#### Primary Keys

**Intent**: Uniquely identify each record in a table.

A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures entity integrity by preventing duplicate entries and null values in the primary key column(s).

**Key Participants**:
- **Table**: The table where the primary key is defined.
- **Column(s)**: The column(s) that make up the primary key.

**Sample Code Snippet**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In this example, `EmployeeID` is the primary key for the `Employees` table, ensuring that each employee has a unique identifier.

**Design Considerations**:
- Choose a primary key that is stable and does not change over time.
- Avoid using business logic as primary keys (e.g., Social Security Numbers).

#### Foreign Keys

**Intent**: Maintain referential integrity between tables.

A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It ensures that the relationship between the two tables is valid and that the data remains consistent.

**Key Participants**:
- **Parent Table**: The table containing the primary key.
- **Child Table**: The table containing the foreign key.

**Sample Code Snippet**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);
```

Here, `DepartmentID` in the `Employees` table is a foreign key referencing the `DepartmentID` in the `Departments` table.

**Design Considerations**:
- Ensure that foreign keys are indexed for performance optimization.
- Use cascading actions (e.g., ON DELETE CASCADE) judiciously to maintain data integrity.

#### Unique Constraints

**Intent**: Enforce uniqueness on non-primary key columns.

A unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct from one another. It is similar to a primary key but allows for one null value.

**Key Participants**:
- **Table**: The table where the unique constraint is defined.
- **Column(s)**: The column(s) that must have unique values.

**Sample Code Snippet**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

In this example, both `Username` and `Email` must be unique across the `Users` table.

**Design Considerations**:
- Use unique constraints to enforce business rules, such as unique usernames or email addresses.
- Be mindful of performance implications when applying unique constraints to large tables.

#### Check Constraints

**Intent**: Enforce domain integrity by limiting allowed values.

A check constraint ensures that the values in a column meet a specific condition. It is used to enforce domain integrity by restricting the range of values that can be entered into a column.

**Key Participants**:
- **Table**: The table where the check constraint is defined.
- **Column(s)**: The column(s) subject to the constraint.

**Sample Code Snippet**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    CHECK (Price > 0)
);
```

Here, the check constraint ensures that the `Price` of a product is always greater than zero.

**Design Considerations**:
- Use check constraints to enforce business rules, such as age restrictions or valid date ranges.
- Be aware of potential performance impacts when using complex expressions in check constraints.

#### Not Null Constraints

**Intent**: Ensure that a column cannot contain NULL values.

A not null constraint ensures that a column must always have a value. It is used to enforce domain integrity by preventing null values in a column.

**Key Participants**:
- **Table**: The table where the not null constraint is defined.
- **Column**: The column that must not contain null values.

**Sample Code Snippet**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderDate DATE NOT NULL,
    CustomerID INT NOT NULL
);
```

In this example, both `OrderDate` and `CustomerID` must have values for each order.

**Design Considerations**:
- Use not null constraints to ensure critical data is always present.
- Consider default values for columns with not null constraints to simplify data entry.

### Visualizing Constraints

To better understand how constraints work together to maintain data integrity, let's visualize the relationships between tables and constraints using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    EMPLOYEES {
        INT EmployeeID PK
        VARCHAR FirstName
        VARCHAR LastName
        INT DepartmentID FK
    }
    DEPARTMENTS {
        INT DepartmentID PK
        VARCHAR DepartmentName
    }
    EMPLOYEES ||--o{ DEPARTMENTS : "belongs to"
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `EMPLOYEES` and `DEPARTMENTS` tables. The `EmployeeID` is the primary key in the `EMPLOYEES` table, and `DepartmentID` is a foreign key referencing the primary key in the `DEPARTMENTS` table.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of constraints, try modifying the code examples provided. For instance, add a new column to the `Employees` table with a check constraint that ensures the employee's age is greater than 18. Experiment with adding and removing constraints to see how they affect data integrity.
