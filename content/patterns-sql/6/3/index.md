## 6.3 Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control

Concurrency control is a critical aspect of database management, ensuring that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without leading to data inconsistencies. In this section, we will delve into two primary concurrency control mechanisms: **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** and **Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)**. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for expert software engineers and architects who aim to design robust, efficient, and scalable database systems.

### Introduction to Concurrency Control

Concurrency control in databases is the process of managing simultaneous operations without conflicting with each other. It ensures the consistency and integrity of data when multiple transactions are executed concurrently. The two main strategies for concurrency control are optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control.

### Pessimistic Concurrency Control

#### Approach

Pessimistic concurrency control assumes that conflicts between transactions are likely to occur. As a result, it locks data resources when a transaction reads or writes data. This locking mechanism prevents other transactions from accessing the locked data until the lock is released, thereby avoiding conflicts.

#### Use Cases

Pessimistic concurrency control is suitable for high-contention environments where data conflicts are frequent. It is often used in scenarios where:

- Transactions are long-running and involve complex operations.
- The cost of resolving conflicts is high.
- Data integrity is critical, and the risk of data corruption must be minimized.

#### Implementation

Pessimistic concurrency control can be implemented using various locking mechanisms, such as:

- **Exclusive Locks**: Prevent other transactions from reading or writing the locked data.
- **Shared Locks**: Allow other transactions to read but not write the locked data.

Here is a simple SQL example demonstrating pessimistic locking:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Acquire an exclusive lock on the row
SELECT * FROM accounts
WHERE account_id = 12345
FOR UPDATE;

-- Perform operations on the locked data
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 12345;

COMMIT;
```

In this example, the `FOR UPDATE` clause locks the selected row, preventing other transactions from modifying it until the current transaction is committed or rolled back.

### Optimistic Concurrency Control

#### Approach

Optimistic concurrency control assumes that conflicts are rare and allows transactions to proceed without locking data resources. Instead, it checks for conflicts before committing a transaction. If a conflict is detected, the transaction is rolled back and retried.

#### Use Cases

Optimistic concurrency control is ideal for low-contention environments where data conflicts are infrequent. It is commonly used in scenarios where:

- Transactions are short-lived and involve simple operations.
- The cost of retrying a transaction is low.
- The system can tolerate occasional rollbacks.

#### Implementation

Optimistic concurrency control can be implemented using version numbers or timestamps to detect changes. Here is an example using a version column:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Retrieve the current version of the row
SELECT balance, version FROM accounts
WHERE account_id = 12345;

-- Perform operations on the data
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100, version = version + 1
WHERE account_id = 12345 AND version = @current_version;

-- Check if the update was successful
IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
BEGIN
    -- Conflict detected, rollback and retry
    ROLLBACK;
    -- Retry logic here
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    COMMIT;
END
```

In this example, the `version` column is used to detect changes. If another transaction modifies the row before the current transaction commits, the `WHERE` clause will fail, and the transaction will be rolled back.

### Visualizing Concurrency Control

To better understand the differences between optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control, let's visualize the processes using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Pessimistic Concurrency Control Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1 as Transaction 1
    participant DB as Database
    participant T2 as Transaction 2

    T1->>DB: Lock data for update
    T2->>DB: Request lock
    DB-->>T2: Wait for lock
    T1->>DB: Update data
    T1->>DB: Release lock
    DB-->>T2: Acquire lock
    T2->>DB: Update data
```

#### Optimistic Concurrency Control Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1 as Transaction 1
    participant DB as Database
    participant T2 as Transaction 2

    T1->>DB: Read data
    T2->>DB: Read data
    T1->>DB: Update data
    T2->>DB: Update data
    DB-->>T2: Conflict detected, rollback
    T2->>DB: Retry update
```

### Key Participants

- **Transaction**: A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.
- **Database**: The system that manages data and enforces concurrency control mechanisms.

### Applicability

- **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**: Use when data conflicts are frequent, and the cost of resolving conflicts is high.
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Use when data conflicts are rare, and the cost of retrying transactions is low.

### Design Considerations

When choosing between optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control, consider the following factors:

- **Transaction Length**: Longer transactions may benefit from pessimistic locking to prevent conflicts.
- **Contention Level**: High-contention environments may require pessimistic locking to ensure data integrity.
- **System Tolerance**: Systems that can tolerate occasional rollbacks may benefit from optimistic concurrency control.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Differences**:
  - Pessimistic concurrency control locks data resources, while optimistic concurrency control allows concurrent access.
  - Pessimistic concurrency control is suitable for high-contention environments, whereas optimistic concurrency control is ideal for low-contention environments.

- **Similarities**:
  - Both mechanisms aim to ensure data consistency and integrity.
  - Both can be implemented using SQL features such as locks, version numbers, and timestamps.
