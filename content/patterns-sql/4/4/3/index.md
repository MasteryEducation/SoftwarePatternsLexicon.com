## 4.4.3 Concrete Table Inheritance

Concrete Table Inheritance is a design pattern used in SQL databases to map object-oriented inheritance hierarchies to relational tables. In this approach, each class in the hierarchy has its own table, and these tables duplicate the columns of the base class. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to avoid complex joins and maintain a straightforward table structure. However, it comes with its own set of challenges, such as data redundancy and increased maintenance overhead.

### Design Pattern Name

**Concrete Table Inheritance**

### Category

**Inheritance Mapping Patterns**

### Intent

The intent of Concrete Table Inheritance is to map each class in an inheritance hierarchy to its own table in a relational database. This pattern simplifies the retrieval of data by eliminating the need for joins, as all the data for a class is contained within a single table. It is particularly useful in scenarios where performance is critical, and the overhead of joins is undesirable.

### Diagrams

To better understand Concrete Table Inheritance, let's visualize the structure using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +int id
        +string name
    }
    class Dog {
        +string breed
    }
    class Cat {
        +string color
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```

In this diagram, `Animal` is the base class, while `Dog` and `Cat` are derived classes. Each class will have its own table in the database.

### Key Participants

- **Base Class Table**: Contains columns that are common to all derived classes.
- **Derived Class Tables**: Each derived class has its own table, including columns from the base class and any additional columns specific to the derived class.

### Applicability

Concrete Table Inheritance is applicable in scenarios where:

- **Performance**: You want to optimize performance by avoiding joins.
- **Simplicity**: You prefer a simple table structure where each class is mapped to a single table.
- **Data Independence**: Each table can be managed independently, which can be advantageous in certain maintenance scenarios.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's consider an example where we have an inheritance hierarchy of `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`. Here's how you can implement Concrete Table Inheritance in SQL:

```sql
-- Table for the base class Animal
CREATE TABLE Animal (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Table for the derived class Dog
CREATE TABLE Dog (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    breed VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES Animal(id)
);

-- Table for the derived class Cat
CREATE TABLE Cat (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    color VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES Animal(id)
);
```

In this example, each derived class (`Dog` and `Cat`) has its own table, which includes the columns from the `Animal` table.

### Design Considerations

When using Concrete Table Inheritance, consider the following:

- **Data Redundancy**: Since each table duplicates the columns of the base class, there is a risk of data redundancy.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to the base class structure need to be propagated to all derived class tables.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that data remains consistent across tables, especially when updates are made.

### Differences and Similarities

Concrete Table Inheritance is often compared to other inheritance mapping patterns, such as:

- **Single Table Inheritance**: All classes are stored in a single table, which can lead to sparse data and complex queries.
- **Class Table Inheritance**: Each class has its own table, but the base class table is separate, requiring joins to retrieve complete objects.

Concrete Table Inheritance differs in that it avoids joins by duplicating base class columns in each derived class table.

### Try It Yourself

To better understand Concrete Table Inheritance, try modifying the code example above:

- **Add a new derived class**: Create a new table for a `Bird` class with additional attributes.
- **Modify the base class**: Add a new column to the `Animal` table and update the derived class tables accordingly.
- **Experiment with queries**: Write SQL queries to retrieve data from the `Dog` and `Cat` tables and observe the performance.

### Visualizing Concrete Table Inheritance

Let's visualize how data is stored in Concrete Table Inheritance using a table diagram:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ANIMAL {
        int id PK
        string name
    }
    DOG {
        int id PK
        string name
        string breed
    }
    CAT {
        int id PK
        string name
        string color
    }
    ANIMAL ||--|{ DOG : contains
    ANIMAL ||--|{ CAT : contains
```

This diagram shows the relationship between the `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` tables, highlighting the duplication of the `name` column.
