## 10.4.2 Type 2: Add Row

In the realm of data warehousing and analytics, handling changes in dimension data is a critical task. The Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) pattern, also known as the "Add Row" approach, is a powerful method for preserving historical data. This section delves into the intricacies of the Type 2 pattern, providing expert software engineers and architects with the knowledge needed to implement it effectively.

### Understanding Slowly Changing Dimensions

Before diving into the Type 2 pattern, it's essential to understand the concept of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs). In data warehousing, dimensions are attributes or descriptive data that provide context to facts. Over time, these dimensions may change, and how we handle these changes is crucial for maintaining data integrity and historical accuracy.

### Type 2: Add Row - An Overview

The Type 2 SCD pattern involves adding a new row to the dimension table whenever a change occurs. This approach allows us to maintain a complete history of changes, providing a comprehensive view of the data over time. By preserving historical records, we can perform time-based analyses and gain insights into trends and patterns.

#### Key Characteristics of Type 2 SCD

- **Historical Tracking**: Each change in a dimension results in a new row, capturing the state of the data at that point in time.
- **Versioning**: Rows are versioned, often using start and end dates or a version number, to indicate the validity period of each record.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that historical data remains intact, allowing for accurate reporting and analysis.

### Implementing Type 2 SCD in SQL

To implement the Type 2 SCD pattern, we need to design our dimension tables to accommodate historical data. This involves adding additional columns for versioning and managing the insertion of new rows when changes occur.

#### Designing the Dimension Table

A typical dimension table for a Type 2 SCD might include the following columns:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the dimension.
- **Attributes**: The descriptive data for the dimension (e.g., name, address).
- **Start Date**: The date when the record became effective.
- **End Date**: The date when the record was superseded (often set to a high value for current records).
- **Current Flag**: A boolean flag indicating whether the record is the current version.

Here's an example of a dimension table schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE CustomerDimension (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    StartDate DATE,
    EndDate DATE,
    CurrentFlag BOOLEAN
);
```

#### Inserting New Rows

When a change occurs, we insert a new row with updated attributes and adjust the end date of the previous record. Let's consider a scenario where a customer's address changes:

```sql
-- Assume the current record for CustomerID 1 is:
-- CustomerID: 1, CustomerName: 'John Doe', Address: '123 Elm St', StartDate: '2023-01-01', EndDate: '9999-12-31', CurrentFlag: TRUE

-- Update the current record to set the end date and current flag
UPDATE CustomerDimension
SET EndDate = '2024-11-01', CurrentFlag = FALSE
WHERE CustomerID = 1 AND CurrentFlag = TRUE;

-- Insert the new record with the updated address
INSERT INTO CustomerDimension (CustomerID, CustomerName, Address, StartDate, EndDate, CurrentFlag)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', '456 Oak St', '2024-11-02', '9999-12-31', TRUE);
```

### Visualizing the Type 2 SCD Process

To better understand the Type 2 SCD process, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram. This diagram illustrates the steps involved in updating a dimension record and inserting a new row.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    participant Database

    User->>System: Request to update Customer Address
    System->>Database: Query current Customer record
    Database-->>System: Return current Customer record
    System->>Database: Update current record's EndDate and CurrentFlag
    Database-->>System: Confirm update
    System->>Database: Insert new Customer record with updated Address
    Database-->>System: Confirm insertion
    System-->>User: Address update successful
```

### Advantages of Type 2 SCD

The Type 2 SCD pattern offers several advantages, making it a popular choice for handling dimension changes:

- **Comprehensive History**: By maintaining a complete history of changes, we can perform time-based analyses and gain insights into trends and patterns.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that historical data remains intact, allowing for accurate reporting and analysis.
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex queries and analyses that require historical context.

### Design Considerations

While the Type 2 SCD pattern is powerful, it also comes with certain design considerations:

- **Storage Requirements**: As each change results in a new row, the dimension table can grow significantly over time. It's important to plan for sufficient storage and consider archiving strategies.
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple versions of a record can increase the complexity of queries and data management. Proper indexing and query optimization are essential.
- **Performance**: Inserting new rows and updating existing records can impact performance, especially in high-volume environments. Consider using batch processing and efficient indexing strategies.

### Differences and Similarities with Other SCD Types

The Type 2 SCD pattern is often compared with other SCD types:

- **Type 1 (Overwrite)**: In Type 1, changes overwrite the existing record, with no historical tracking. This is simpler but lacks historical context.
- **Type 3 (Add Column)**: Type 3 adds a column to track changes, but only retains limited history. It's less comprehensive than Type 2.

### Code Example: Implementing Type 2 SCD

Let's walk through a complete example of implementing the Type 2 SCD pattern in SQL. We'll use a `ProductDimension` table to track changes in product attributes.

```sql
-- Create the ProductDimension table
CREATE TABLE ProductDimension (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    StartDate DATE,
    EndDate DATE,
    CurrentFlag BOOLEAN
);

-- Insert an initial product record
INSERT INTO ProductDimension (ProductID, ProductName, Category, StartDate, EndDate, CurrentFlag)
VALUES (101, 'Widget A', 'Gadgets', '2023-01-01', '9999-12-31', TRUE);

-- Update the product category
-- Step 1: Update the current record
UPDATE ProductDimension
SET EndDate = '2024-11-01', CurrentFlag = FALSE
WHERE ProductID = 101 AND CurrentFlag = TRUE;

-- Step 2: Insert the new record with the updated category
INSERT INTO ProductDimension (ProductID, ProductName, Category, StartDate, EndDate, CurrentFlag)
VALUES (101, 'Widget A', 'Electronics', '2024-11-02', '9999-12-31', TRUE);
```

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Type 2 SCD pattern, try modifying the code examples above. Experiment with different scenarios, such as:

- Adding additional attributes to the dimension table.
- Implementing a version number instead of start and end dates.
- Creating a trigger to automate the update and insert process.
