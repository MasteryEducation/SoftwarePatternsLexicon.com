## 10.4.3 Type 3: Add Column

In the realm of data warehousing, handling changes in dimension data is a critical task. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) are dimensions that change slowly over time, rather than changing on a regular schedule, time-base, or in real-time. The Type 3 Add Column approach is one of the methods used to manage these changes. This method involves adding new columns to track changes, allowing for a limited history of changes to be stored.

### Understanding Slowly Changing Dimensions

Before diving into the Type 3 Add Column approach, let's briefly revisit the concept of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD). Dimensions are attributes or characteristics of data that provide context to facts in a data warehouse. For example, in a sales database, dimensions might include product, customer, and time. Over time, these dimensions can change. For instance, a customer might change their address or a product might be rebranded.

Handling these changes efficiently is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of data in a warehouse. There are several types of SCDs, each with its own method for managing changes:

- **Type 1**: Overwrite the old data with new data.
- **Type 2**: Add a new row to capture changes, preserving historical data.
- **Type 3**: Add a new column to track changes, allowing for a limited history.

### Type 3 Add Column: An Overview

The Type 3 Add Column approach is a compromise between Type 1 and Type 2. It allows for tracking changes by adding additional columns to the dimension table. This method is particularly useful when you need to track only a limited history of changes, such as the previous value of an attribute.

#### Key Characteristics of Type 3 Add Column

- **Limited History**: Type 3 tracks only a limited history of changes, usually the current and one previous value.
- **Additional Columns**: New columns are added to store historical values.
- **Simplified Queries**: Queries can be simplified as they don't need to join multiple rows to get historical data.
- **Space Efficiency**: More space-efficient than Type 2, as it doesn't require additional rows for each change.

### Implementing Type 3 Add Column

To implement the Type 3 Add Column approach, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Attributes**: Determine which attributes in your dimension table are subject to change and need historical tracking.
2. **Add New Columns**: For each attribute you want to track, add a new column to store the previous value.
3. **Update Logic**: Implement logic to update these columns whenever a change occurs.

#### Example Scenario

Consider a customer dimension table where we want to track changes in the customer's city. Initially, the table might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(100)
);
```

To implement Type 3, we add a new column to track the previous city:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Customer
ADD PreviousCity VARCHAR(100);
```

When a customer's city changes, the update logic would look like this:

```sql
UPDATE Customer
SET PreviousCity = City,
    City = 'NewCity'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

### Visualizing the Type 3 Add Column Approach

To better understand how the Type 3 Add Column approach works, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is there a change in the attribute?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Copy current value to Previous Column];
    C --> D[Update current value];
    D --> E[End];
    B -- No --> E;
```

**Figure 1**: Flowchart illustrating the Type 3 Add Column process.

### Benefits of Type 3 Add Column

- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand.
- **Efficiency**: More space-efficient than Type 2, as it doesn't require additional rows.
- **Performance**: Queries can be faster since they don't need to join multiple rows to get historical data.

### Limitations of Type 3 Add Column

- **Limited History**: Only tracks a limited history of changes, typically the current and one previous value.
- **Scalability**: Not suitable for attributes that change frequently or require extensive historical tracking.
- **Complexity**: Can become complex if many attributes require tracking, leading to a large number of additional columns.

### Applicability of Type 3 Add Column

The Type 3 Add Column approach is best suited for scenarios where:

- You need to track only a limited history of changes.
- The attributes change infrequently.
- Space efficiency is a concern.
- Simplicity and performance are prioritized over extensive historical tracking.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's look at a complete example of implementing the Type 3 Add Column approach in a customer dimension table.

```sql
-- Create the Customer table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(100),
    PreviousCity VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert initial data
INSERT INTO Customer (CustomerID, CustomerName, City)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'New York');

-- Update the City and track the previous value
UPDATE Customer
SET PreviousCity = City,
    City = 'Los Angeles'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

-- Query to see the changes
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, PreviousCity
FROM Customer;
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Type 3 Add Column approach, consider the following:

- **Attribute Selection**: Carefully select which attributes require historical tracking.
- **Column Management**: Manage the additional columns to avoid cluttering the table.
- **Update Logic**: Ensure the update logic is efficient and correctly implemented.

### Differences and Similarities with Other SCD Types

- **Type 1 vs. Type 3**: Type 1 overwrites data, losing history, while Type 3 retains limited history.
- **Type 2 vs. Type 3**: Type 2 adds new rows for each change, preserving full history, while Type 3 adds columns, preserving limited history.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Type 3 Add Column approach, try modifying the example code to:

- Track changes for multiple attributes, such as `State` or `Country`.
- Implement logic to revert to the previous value if needed.
- Experiment with different scenarios to see how the approach handles various changes.

### Conclusion

The Type 3 Add Column approach offers a balanced solution for tracking changes in dimension data, providing a limited history while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. By understanding its benefits and limitations, you can effectively apply this method in your data warehousing projects.
