## 5.13 Dynamic Query Building

Dynamic query building is a powerful technique in SQL that allows developers to construct queries based on user inputs or other runtime conditions. This flexibility is essential for creating adaptable and responsive applications. However, it also introduces challenges, particularly around security and performance. In this section, we will explore the techniques and best practices for dynamic query building, focusing on parameterized queries, stored procedures, and security measures to prevent SQL injection.

### Introduction to Dynamic Query Building

Dynamic query building involves creating SQL queries that can change based on input parameters or conditions. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the exact query structure cannot be determined until runtime. For example, a search feature in an application might allow users to filter results based on various criteria, requiring the query to adapt to different combinations of filters.

#### Scenarios for Dynamic Query Building

Dynamic query building is commonly used in the following scenarios:

- **User-Driven Searches**: Constructing queries based on user-selected filters or search criteria.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generating queries for reports that require different data views or aggregations.
- **Conditional Logic**: Executing different queries based on application logic or user roles.

### Techniques for Dynamic Query Building

There are several techniques for building dynamic queries in SQL, each with its own advantages and considerations. The most common techniques include parameterized queries and stored procedures.

#### Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries are a method of dynamically constructing SQL queries by injecting variables into predefined query templates. This approach not only simplifies query construction but also enhances security by preventing SQL injection attacks.

**Example of a Parameterized Query:**

```sql
-- Define a parameterized query to fetch user details based on user ID
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserID = @UserID;
```

In this example, `@UserID` is a parameter that will be replaced with an actual value at runtime. This prevents malicious input from altering the query structure.

**Benefits of Parameterized Queries:**

- **Security**: By separating SQL code from data, parameterized queries prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Performance**: Parameterized queries can be precompiled, improving execution speed.
- **Maintainability**: Queries are easier to read and maintain, as the logic is separated from the data.

#### Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code stored in the database that can accept parameters and execute complex logic. They are an excellent choice for dynamic query building when the logic is too complex for simple parameterized queries.

**Example of a Stored Procedure:**

```sql
-- Create a stored procedure to fetch orders based on customer ID and order date
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerOrders
    @CustomerID INT,
    @OrderDate DATE
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Orders
    WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID AND OrderDate = @OrderDate;
END;
```

In this example, the stored procedure `GetCustomerOrders` takes two parameters, `@CustomerID` and `@OrderDate`, and returns orders matching these criteria.

**Benefits of Stored Procedures:**

- **Encapsulation**: Complex logic can be encapsulated within the database, reducing application complexity.
- **Reusability**: Stored procedures can be reused across different applications or modules.
- **Security**: Permissions can be managed at the procedure level, controlling access to underlying data.

### Security Considerations

Dynamic query building, if not handled properly, can expose applications to SQL injection attacks. SQL injection is a technique where an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code by manipulating input data. To prevent this, it is crucial to follow best practices for query construction and input validation.

#### Preventing SQL Injection

- **Use Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from data.
- **Validate Input**: Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized before being used in queries.
- **Limit Permissions**: Restrict database permissions to only what is necessary for the application to function.
- **Use Stored Procedures**: Where possible, use stored procedures to encapsulate query logic and control access.

**Example of SQL Injection Prevention:**

```sql
-- Incorrect: Vulnerable to SQL injection
string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";

-- Correct: Using parameterized query
string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @Username";
```

In the correct example, the parameter `@Username` is used to safely inject user input into the query.

### Best Practices for Dynamic Query Building

To effectively use dynamic query building, consider the following best practices:

- **Design for Flexibility**: Anticipate changes in requirements and design queries that can adapt to new conditions.
- **Optimize for Performance**: Use indexing and query optimization techniques to ensure dynamic queries perform well.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test dynamic queries with a variety of inputs to ensure they handle all scenarios correctly.
- **Monitor and Log**: Implement logging to track query execution and identify potential issues.

### Visualizing Dynamic Query Building

To better understand the flow of dynamic query building, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Application
    participant Database

    User->>Application: Provide input parameters
    Application->>Database: Send parameterized query
    Database-->>Application: Return query results
    Application-->>User: Display results
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a user, an application, and a database during dynamic query building. The user provides input parameters, which the application uses to construct a parameterized query. The query is sent to the database, which returns the results to the application for display.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with dynamic query building by modifying the following code example to add additional filters or conditions.

```sql
-- Original query to fetch products based on category
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE CategoryID = @CategoryID;

-- Try adding a price filter
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE CategoryID = @CategoryID AND Price < @MaxPrice;
```
