## 9.5.1 Data at Rest Encryption

In today's data-driven world, ensuring the security of sensitive information stored in databases is paramount. Data at Rest Encryption (DARE) is a critical component of a comprehensive data security strategy, protecting data stored on disk from unauthorized access and breaches. This section delves into the intricacies of Data at Rest Encryption, focusing on Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), Cell-Level Encryption, and Key Management.

### Understanding Data at Rest Encryption

Data at Rest refers to inactive data stored physically in any digital form (e.g., databases, data warehouses). Encrypting this data ensures that even if unauthorized parties gain access to the storage media, they cannot read the data without the appropriate decryption keys.

#### Key Concepts

- **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and an encryption key.
- **Decryption**: The reverse process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext using a decryption key.
- **Encryption Key**: A piece of information that determines the output of the encryption algorithm.

### Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is a popular method for encrypting database files at the storage level. It encrypts the entire database, including backups, without requiring changes to the application layer.

#### How TDE Works

TDE encrypts the data files at the page level. The encryption and decryption processes are transparent to the application, meaning that the application does not need to be aware of the encryption. This is achieved by encrypting the data as it is written to disk and decrypting it as it is read into memory.

#### Key Participants

- **Database Engine**: Manages the encryption and decryption processes.
- **Encryption Keys**: Includes the Database Encryption Key (DEK) and the Master Key.

#### Implementing TDE

Let's explore how to implement TDE in SQL Server, a widely used relational database management system.

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a Master Key
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourStrongPassword';

-- Step 2: Create a Certificate
CREATE CERTIFICATE MyTDECert WITH SUBJECT = 'TDE Certificate';

-- Step 3: Create a Database Encryption Key
USE YourDatabase;
CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY
WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256
ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE MyTDECert;

-- Step 4: Enable TDE
ALTER DATABASE YourDatabase
SET ENCRYPTION ON;
```

> **Note**: The above SQL commands demonstrate enabling TDE on a SQL Server database. Ensure that you replace placeholders like `YourStrongPassword` and `YourDatabase` with actual values.

#### Design Considerations

- **Performance Impact**: TDE can introduce a performance overhead due to the encryption and decryption processes.
- **Backup Encryption**: TDE automatically encrypts database backups, ensuring data security even when backups are stored offsite.
- **Key Management**: Proper management of encryption keys is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.

### Cell-Level Encryption

Cell-Level Encryption allows for encrypting specific columns within a database table. This approach provides more granular control over which data is encrypted, making it suitable for protecting sensitive information like credit card numbers or social security numbers.

#### How Cell-Level Encryption Works

Cell-Level Encryption involves encrypting data at the column level using functions provided by the database management system. This method requires changes to the application logic to handle encryption and decryption.

#### Implementing Cell-Level Encryption

Here's an example of implementing Cell-Level Encryption in SQL Server:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a Symmetric Key
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY MySymmetricKey
WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256
ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'AnotherStrongPassword';

-- Step 2: Encrypt Data
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY MySymmetricKey
DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'AnotherStrongPassword';

UPDATE Customers
SET EncryptedCreditCard = EncryptByKey(Key_GUID('MySymmetricKey'), CreditCardNumber);

CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY MySymmetricKey;

-- Step 3: Decrypt Data
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY MySymmetricKey
DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'AnotherStrongPassword';

SELECT CustomerID, 
       CONVERT(varchar, DecryptByKey(EncryptedCreditCard)) AS CreditCardNumber
FROM Customers;

CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY MySymmetricKey;
```

> **Note**: The example above demonstrates encrypting and decrypting a credit card number in a `Customers` table. Adjust the table and column names as needed.

#### Design Considerations

- **Granularity**: Provides fine-grained control over which data is encrypted.
- **Application Changes**: Requires modifications to application logic to handle encryption and decryption.
- **Performance**: May impact performance due to the overhead of encrypting and decrypting individual columns.

### Key Management

Effective Key Management is crucial for maintaining the security of encrypted data. It involves the secure storage, rotation, and access control of encryption keys.

#### Key Management Best Practices

- **Secure Storage**: Store encryption keys in a secure location, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a key management service.
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate encryption keys to minimize the risk of key compromise.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to encryption keys to authorized personnel only.

#### Implementing Key Management

Many cloud providers offer key management services that simplify the process of managing encryption keys. For example, AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and Azure Key Vault provide secure key storage and management capabilities.

### Visualizing Data at Rest Encryption

To better understand the flow of data encryption and decryption, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid

    participant Disk

    Application->>Database: Write Data
    Database->>Disk: Encrypt Data
    Disk-->>Database: Store Encrypted Data

    Application->>Database: Read Data
    Database->>Disk: Decrypt Data
    Disk-->>Database: Retrieve Encrypted Data
    Database-->>Application: Return Plaintext Data
```

> **Description**: This diagram illustrates the process of encrypting data as it is written to disk and decrypting it as it is read back into the database.
