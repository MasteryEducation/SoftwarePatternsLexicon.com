## 14.8 Transactions and ACID Compliance in NoSQL

In the world of databases, transactions and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance are fundamental concepts that ensure data integrity and reliability. While these principles are well-established in traditional SQL databases, the rise of NoSQL databases has introduced new paradigms and challenges. In this section, we will delve into the nuances of transactions and ACID compliance in NoSQL databases, exploring their capabilities, limitations, and the trade-offs involved.

### Understanding ACID in NoSQL

ACID properties are a set of principles that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. Let's briefly revisit these principles:

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that a series of operations within a transaction are completed entirely or not at all.
- **Consistency**: Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure.

NoSQL databases, designed for scalability and flexibility, often relax one or more of these properties to achieve their goals. This relaxation leads to different consistency models and transaction capabilities.

### Limited Support for Transactions

NoSQL databases are known for their schema-less design and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of traditional ACID compliance. Many NoSQL databases offer limited support for transactions, often restricting them to a single document or record.

#### Multi-Document Transactions

Recent advancements in NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, have introduced support for multi-document transactions. This feature allows developers to perform ACID-compliant operations across multiple documents, bringing NoSQL closer to traditional relational databases in terms of transaction capabilities.

```json
// Example of a multi-document transaction in MongoDB
const session = client.startSession();
session.startTransaction();
try {
  const ordersCollection = client.db("shop").collection("orders");
  const inventoryCollection = client.db("shop").collection("inventory");

  // Insert a new order
  await ordersCollection.insertOne({ item: "laptop", qty: 1 }, { session });

  // Update inventory
  await inventoryCollection.updateOne(
    { item: "laptop" },
    { $inc: { qty: -1 } },
    { session }
  );

  // Commit the transaction
  await session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  // Abort the transaction in case of an error
  await session.abortTransaction();
} finally {
  session.endSession();
}
```

In this example, we demonstrate a multi-document transaction in MongoDB, where an order is inserted, and the inventory is updated atomically.

### Consistency Models in NoSQL

NoSQL databases offer various consistency models, each with its own trade-offs between performance and data integrity.

#### Eventual Consistency

Eventual consistency is a model where updates to a database will eventually propagate to all nodes, given enough time. This model is suitable for applications where immediate consistency is not critical, such as social media feeds or product catalogs.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Write Operation] --> B[Node 1];
  A --> C[Node 2];
  A --> D[Node 3];
  B --> E[Propagation to Node 2];
  C --> F[Propagation to Node 3];
  D --> G[Propagation to Node 1];
```

*Diagram: Eventual Consistency Model - Updates propagate to all nodes over time.*

#### Strong Consistency

Strong consistency ensures that all nodes reflect the most recent write operation immediately. This model provides a higher level of data integrity but can impact performance and scalability.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Write Operation] --> B[Node 1];
  A --> C[Node 2];
  A --> D[Node 3];
  B --> E[Immediate Consistency];
  C --> E;
  D --> E;
```

*Diagram: Strong Consistency Model - All nodes reflect the latest write immediately.*

### Trade-offs: Scalability vs. Consistency

NoSQL databases often face trade-offs between scalability and consistency. The CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) highlights these trade-offs, stating that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the three properties at any given time.

- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability**: Every request receives a response, regardless of the success or failure of the operation.
- **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions.

#### Balancing Performance and Data Integrity

Choosing the right consistency model depends on the application's requirements. For example, a banking application may prioritize strong consistency to ensure accurate account balances, while a social media platform may opt for eventual consistency to improve performance and user experience.

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

Let's explore some practical examples and use cases where NoSQL databases with varying levels of ACID compliance are beneficial.

#### Use Case: E-Commerce Platform

An e-commerce platform requires real-time inventory updates and order processing. Using a NoSQL database with multi-document transactions, developers can ensure that inventory levels are accurately updated when an order is placed.

```json
// Example of an e-commerce transaction
const session = client.startSession();
session.startTransaction();
try {
  const ordersCollection = client.db("ecommerce").collection("orders");
  const inventoryCollection = client.db("ecommerce").collection("inventory");

  // Insert a new order
  await ordersCollection.insertOne({ item: "phone", qty: 1 }, { session });

  // Update inventory
  await inventoryCollection.updateOne(
    { item: "phone" },
    { $inc: { qty: -1 } },
    { session }
  );

  // Commit the transaction
  await session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  // Abort the transaction in case of an error
  await session.abortTransaction();
} finally {
  session.endSession();
}
```

#### Use Case: Social Media Application

A social media application can benefit from eventual consistency, allowing users to see updates and posts with minimal delay. This model enhances performance and scalability, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying the item names and quantities. Observe how the transaction behaves when you introduce errors or simulate network failures. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of transactions in NoSQL databases.

### Visualizing Transactions and Consistency Models

To further illustrate the concepts discussed, let's visualize the transaction flow and consistency models using Mermaid.js diagrams.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client
  participant Database
  Client->>Database: Start Transaction
  Database-->>Client: Acknowledge
  Client->>Database: Insert Order
  Database-->>Client: Acknowledge
  Client->>Database: Update Inventory
  Database-->>Client: Acknowledge
  Client->>Database: Commit Transaction
  Database-->>Client: Acknowledge
```
