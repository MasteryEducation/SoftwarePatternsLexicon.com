## 20.2 SQL Standards Reference (SQL-92 to SQL:2016)

In the ever-evolving landscape of database management, SQL (Structured Query Language) has been a cornerstone for relational database systems. Understanding the progression of SQL standards is crucial for expert software engineers and architects aiming to leverage the full potential of SQL in modern applications. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of SQL standards from SQL-92 to SQL:2016, highlighting key features and enhancements introduced in each revision. Additionally, we will compare the compliance levels among different RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) to help you make informed decisions in your database design and implementation.

### Evolution of SQL Standards

SQL standards have undergone significant changes since their inception, with each revision introducing new features, improving existing functionalities, and addressing the needs of modern data architectures. Let's explore each major SQL standard revision in detail:

#### SQL-92 (SQL2)

**Released**: 1992

**Key Features**:
- **Enhanced Data Types**: SQL-92 introduced new data types such as DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP, providing more robust support for date and time operations.
- **Subqueries**: Support for subqueries in the `FROM` clause, allowing more complex query structures.
- **Set Operations**: Introduction of set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
- **String Operations**: Enhanced string manipulation capabilities with functions like `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `TRIM`, and `SUBSTRING`.
- **Constraints**: Improved support for constraints, including `CHECK` constraints for data validation.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Using a subquery in the FROM clause
SELECT department_name, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, salary
    FROM employees
) AS dept_salaries
GROUP BY department_name;
```

#### SQL:1999 (SQL3)

**Released**: 1999

**Key Features**:
- **Object-Relational Features**: Introduction of user-defined types (UDTs) and object-oriented features, allowing more complex data structures.
- **Recursive Queries**: Support for recursive queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
- **Triggers and Procedures**: Enhanced procedural capabilities with triggers and stored procedures.
- **OLAP Functions**: Introduction of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) functions for advanced data analysis.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Recursive CTE for hierarchical data retrieval
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT employee_id, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

#### SQL:2003

**Released**: 2003

**Key Features**:
- **XML Support**: Integration of XML data handling capabilities, including XML data types and functions.
- **Window Functions**: Introduction of window functions for advanced analytical queries.
- **MERGE Statement**: The `MERGE` statement for conditional insert, update, or delete operations.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Using a window function to calculate running totals
SELECT employee_id, salary, SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY employee_id) AS running_total
FROM employees;
```

#### SQL:2006

**Released**: 2006

**Key Features**:
- **XML Enhancements**: Further enhancements to XML support, including XQuery integration for querying XML data.
- **SQL/XML**: Introduction of SQL/XML standard for seamless integration of SQL and XML.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Querying XML data using XQuery
SELECT xml_data.query('/employees/employee[name="John Doe"]') AS employee_info
FROM xml_table;
```

#### SQL:2008

**Released**: 2008

**Key Features**:
- **Temporal Databases**: Introduction of temporal database features for handling historical data.
- **Enhanced MERGE Statement**: Improvements to the `MERGE` statement for more complex conditional logic.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Using temporal features to query historical data
SELECT * FROM employees FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2023-01-01';
```

#### SQL:2011

**Released**: 2011

**Key Features**:
- **Temporal Enhancements**: Further enhancements to temporal features, including system-versioned tables.
- **Advanced OLAP Functions**: Introduction of new OLAP functions for complex analytical queries.

**Example**:
```sql
-- System-versioned temporal table query
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

#### SQL:2016

**Released**: 2016

**Key Features**:
- **JSON Support**: Native support for JSON data types and functions, enabling seamless integration of JSON data.
- **Row Pattern Recognition**: Introduction of row pattern recognition for complex data analysis.
- **Polymorphic Table Functions**: Support for polymorphic table functions for more flexible query structures.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Querying JSON data
SELECT json_data->>'name' AS employee_name
FROM employees_json
WHERE json_data->>'department' = 'Sales';
```

### Standard Compliance: Comparison of RDBMS

Different RDBMS vendors implement SQL standards to varying degrees, often adding proprietary extensions to enhance functionality. Understanding the compliance levels of popular RDBMS can help you choose the right system for your needs.

| Feature/Standard | MySQL | PostgreSQL | Oracle | SQL Server |
|------------------|-------|------------|--------|------------|
| SQL-92           | Full  | Full       | Full   | Full       |
| SQL:1999         | Partial | Full     | Full   | Full       |
| SQL:2003         | Partial | Full     | Full   | Full       |
| SQL:2006         | Partial | Full     | Full   | Full       |
| SQL:2008         | Partial | Full     | Full   | Full       |
| SQL:2011         | Partial | Full     | Full   | Full       |
