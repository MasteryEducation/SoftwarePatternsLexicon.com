## 20.1 Glossary of Terms

Welcome to the comprehensive glossary of terms for "Mastering SQL Design Patterns: A Comprehensive Guide for Expert Software Engineers and Architects." This glossary serves as a valuable resource for understanding the technical terminology and concepts discussed throughout the guide. Each term is explained clearly and concisely, with an emphasis on practical application in SQL development.

### A

- **ACID Properties**: A set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure that transactions are processed reliably and help maintain data integrity.

- **Adjacency List Model**: A way to represent hierarchical data in a relational database using a parent-child relationship. Each node in the hierarchy stores a reference to its parent node.

- **Aggregate Functions**: SQL functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

### B

- **B-Tree Index**: A balanced tree data structure used in databases to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. B-Tree indexes are commonly used for indexing columns in a database table.

- **Bitmap Index**: An index type that uses bitmaps to represent the presence or absence of a value in a column. Bitmap indexes are efficient for columns with a limited number of distinct values.

- **Big Data Integration**: The process of integrating large volumes of data from various sources into a database system for analysis and processing.

### C

- **CAP Theorem**: A principle that states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two of the following three properties at the same time: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
