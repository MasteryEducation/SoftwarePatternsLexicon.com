## 5.2. Either Monad

### Introduction

In functional programming, handling computations that can result in success or failure is a common requirement. The Either Monad is a powerful pattern that provides a structured way to manage these dual-outcome computations. By representing success and failure explicitly, the Either Monad enhances code clarity and robustness, allowing developers to handle errors gracefully without resorting to exceptions or null values.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Either Monad is to encapsulate computations that may result in two distinct outcomes: a successful result or an error. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where operations can fail, such as file I/O, network requests, or data parsing. By using the Either Monad, developers can chain computations together, propagating errors seamlessly and handling them at a higher level in the application.

### Key Participants

- **Either Monad**: The core structure representing a computation with two possible outcomes.
- **Left**: Represents the error or failure case, typically carrying error information.
- **Right**: Represents the success case, carrying the successful result of the computation.

### Applicability

The Either Monad is applicable in any situation where a computation can result in success or failure. It is particularly useful in functional programming languages that emphasize immutability and pure functions, as it allows for error handling without side effects. Common use cases include:

- Validating user input
- Handling network requests
- Parsing data
- Managing file I/O operations

### Working with Left and Right

The Either Monad consists of two primary components: Left and Right. These components are used to represent the two possible outcomes of a computation.

- **Left**: This component is used to represent the error or failure case. It typically carries error information, such as an error message or error code. In functional programming, using Left to represent errors allows developers to handle errors explicitly, avoiding the pitfalls of exceptions or null values.

- **Right**: This component is used to represent the success case. It carries the successful result of the computation. By using Right to represent success, developers can chain computations together, propagating the successful result through the chain.

### Pseudocode Examples

Let's explore some pseudocode examples to illustrate how the Either Monad can be used to handle computations with two possible outcomes.

#### Example 1: Basic Either Monad

```pseudocode
// Define the Either Monad
class Either:
    def __init__(self, is_right, value):
        self.is_right = is_right
        self.value = value

    def is_left(self):
        return not self.is_right

    def is_right(self):
        return self.is_right

// Create a function that returns an Either Monad
function divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return Either(False, "Division by zero error")
    else:
        return Either(True, a / b)

// Usage
result = divide(10, 2)
if result.is_right():
    print("Success:", result.value)
else:
    print("Error:", result.value)
```

In this example, we define a simple Either Monad with a constructor that takes a boolean indicating whether the result is a success (Right) or an error (Left), along with the value. The `divide` function returns an Either Monad, representing either a successful division or an error if division by zero is attempted.

#### Example 2: Chaining Computations

```pseudocode
// Define a function to chain computations
function chain(either, func):
    if either.is_right():
        return func(either.value)
    else:
        return either

// Define a function that may fail
function safe_sqrt(x):
    if x < 0:
        return Either(False, "Cannot take square root of negative number")
    else:
        return Either(True, sqrt(x))

// Usage
result = chain(divide(10, 2), safe_sqrt)
if result.is_right():
    print("Success:", result.value)
else:
    print("Error:", result.value)
```

In this example, we define a `chain` function that takes an Either Monad and a function. If the Either Monad represents a success (Right), the function is applied to the value. If it represents an error (Left), the error is propagated. This allows us to chain computations together, handling errors gracefully.

### Visualizing the Either Monad

To better understand the flow of computations with the Either Monad, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Divide}
    B -->|Success| C[Right: Result]
    B -->|Error| D[Left: Error]
    C --> E{Safe Sqrt}
    E -->|Success| F[Right: Result]
    E -->|Error| G[Left: Error]
    D --> H[End]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

**Caption:** This flowchart illustrates the process of chaining computations with the Either Monad. The computation starts with a division operation, which can result in either a success (Right) or an error (Left). If successful, the result is passed to the `safe_sqrt` function, which can also result in a success or error. The final result is either a successful computation or an error.

### Design Considerations

When using the Either Monad, consider the following:

- **Error Propagation**: The Either Monad allows for seamless error propagation through chained computations. Ensure that error information is meaningful and provides enough context for debugging.
- **Type Safety**: In statically typed languages, the Either Monad can enhance type safety by explicitly representing success and failure cases.
- **Performance**: While the Either Monad provides a clean way to handle errors, consider the performance implications of creating and handling monadic structures, especially in performance-critical applications.

### Programming Language Specifics

The Either Monad is a common pattern in functional programming languages such as Haskell, Scala, and F#. However, it can also be implemented in multi-paradigm languages like JavaScript and Python. When implementing the Either Monad in different languages, consider the language's support for functional programming constructs, such as higher-order functions and immutability.

### Differences and Similarities

The Either Monad is often compared to the Option/Maybe Monad. While both patterns handle computations with two possible outcomes, the Either Monad explicitly represents errors, whereas the Option/Maybe Monad represents the presence or absence of a value. Use the Either Monad when you need to carry error information, and the Option/Maybe Monad when the absence of a value is sufficient.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Either Monad, try modifying the pseudocode examples provided. Experiment with different functions that may fail, and chain them together using the Either Monad. Consider how you might handle different types of errors and how you can propagate them through the computation chain.
