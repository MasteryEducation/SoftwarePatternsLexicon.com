## 4.2. Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are a cornerstone of functional programming, providing a powerful way to model data and express computations. They allow developers to define complex data structures in a concise and expressive manner. In this section, we will delve into the concepts of Sum and Product Types, explore the utility of Pattern Matching, and provide pseudocode examples to illustrate how ADTs can be implemented and utilized effectively.

### Introduction to Algebraic Data Types

Algebraic Data Types are a way of defining composite types in functional programming languages. They are called "algebraic" because they are constructed using algebraic operations: sum and product. These operations allow us to build complex types from simpler ones, much like how numbers are constructed from basic arithmetic operations.

#### Sum Types

Sum Types, also known as tagged unions or variant types, represent a choice between different types. They are akin to an "either-or" scenario, where a value can be one of several possible types. This is similar to a union in C or a variant in Pascal, but with added type safety.

**Example of Sum Type:**

Consider a simple example of a `Shape` type that can be either a `Circle` or a `Rectangle`:

```pseudocode
type Shape = Circle(radius: Number) | Rectangle(width: Number, height: Number)
```

In this example, `Shape` is a Sum Type because it can be either a `Circle` or a `Rectangle`. Each variant can have different associated data.

#### Product Types

Product Types, on the other hand, are used to combine multiple types into a single composite type. They are akin to a "both-and" scenario, where a value contains multiple fields, each of a potentially different type. This is similar to a struct in C or a record in Pascal.

**Example of Product Type:**

Consider a `Point` type that consists of an `x` and a `y` coordinate:

```pseudocode
type Point = { x: Number, y: Number }
```

In this example, `Point` is a Product Type because it combines two fields, `x` and `y`, into a single type.

### Pattern Matching

Pattern Matching is a powerful feature in functional programming that allows you to deconstruct and inspect data types in a concise and readable way. It is often used in conjunction with ADTs to handle different cases of Sum Types effectively.

**Example of Pattern Matching:**

Using the `Shape` type defined earlier, we can use pattern matching to calculate the area of a shape:

```pseudocode
function calculateArea(shape: Shape): Number {
  match shape {
    case Circle(radius) => return 3.14 * radius * radius
    case Rectangle(width, height) => return width * height
  }
}
```

In this example, the `match` expression deconstructs the `Shape` type and applies the appropriate logic based on whether the shape is a `Circle` or a `Rectangle`.

### Pseudocode Examples

Let's explore some pseudocode examples to illustrate how ADTs can be defined and utilized in functional programming.

#### Defining Algebraic Data Types

To define an ADT, you typically specify the type and its possible variants. Here is an example of defining a `Result` type that can represent either a success or an error:

```pseudocode
type Result = Success(value: Any) | Error(message: String)
```

This `Result` type is a Sum Type with two variants: `Success` and `Error`. It is commonly used for error handling in functional programming.

#### Using Pattern Matching with ADTs

Pattern matching allows you to handle each variant of an ADT separately. Here is an example of using pattern matching with the `Result` type:

```pseudocode
function handleResult(result: Result): String {
  match result {
    case Success(value) => return "Success with value: " + value.toString()
    case Error(message) => return "Error: " + message
  }
}
```

In this example, the `handleResult` function uses pattern matching to determine whether the `Result` is a `Success` or an `Error` and returns an appropriate message.

### Visualizing Algebraic Data Types

To better understand the structure of ADTs, let's visualize them using a diagram. The following Mermaid.js diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle` types:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Shape -->|Circle| Circle[Circle]
    Shape -->|Rectangle| Rectangle[Rectangle]
    Circle --> radius[Number]
    Rectangle --> width[Number]
    Rectangle --> height[Number]
```

This diagram shows that `Shape` is a Sum Type with two variants: `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Each variant has its own associated data.

### Practical Applications of ADTs

Algebraic Data Types are widely used in functional programming to model complex data structures and control flow. They are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to represent different states or outcomes, such as:

- **Error Handling:** Using ADTs like `Result` or `Option` to handle errors and optional values safely.
- **State Machines:** Representing different states of a system and transitions between them.
- **Domain Modeling:** Defining domain-specific data structures with clear and expressive types.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of ADTs, try modifying the examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- Add a new variant to the `Shape` type, such as `Triangle`, and update the `calculateArea` function to handle it.
- Create a `TrafficLight` type with variants `Red`, `Yellow`, and `Green`, and use pattern matching to determine the next state.
- Implement a `Maybe` type to represent optional values and practice using pattern matching to handle `Some` and `None` cases.

### Key Takeaways
