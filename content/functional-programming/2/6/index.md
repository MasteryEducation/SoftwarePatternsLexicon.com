## 2.6. Closures and Lexical Scope

Closures and lexical scope are fundamental concepts in functional programming that enable powerful patterns such as encapsulation, data privacy, and partial application. Understanding these concepts is crucial for mastering functional programming and writing efficient, maintainable code. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of closures and lexical scope, providing clear explanations, practical applications, and pseudocode examples to illustrate their effects.

### Understanding Closures

**Closures** are a feature of programming languages that allow functions to retain access to their lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. This means that a closure can "remember" the environment in which it was created, including any variables that were in scope at the time.

#### Key Characteristics of Closures

1. **Function Retention**: Closures retain access to their defining environment, allowing them to access variables and functions that were in scope when they were created.
2. **State Preservation**: Closures can maintain state across multiple invocations, making them useful for creating functions with persistent state.
3. **Encapsulation**: By retaining access to their lexical scope, closures can encapsulate data and behavior, providing a mechanism for data privacy.

#### Lexical Scope

**Lexical scope** refers to the region of a program where a binding of a variable is valid. In languages with lexical scoping, the scope of a variable is determined by its position within the source code, and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.

#### Visualizing Lexical Scope

To better understand lexical scope, consider the following diagram that illustrates the scope chain in a nested function structure:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Global Scope] --> B[Function Scope 1]
    B --> C[Function Scope 2]
    C --> D[Function Scope 3]
```

In this diagram, each function scope has access to its own variables and the variables of its parent scopes, forming a chain of scopes.

### Practical Applications of Closures

Closures are versatile and can be used in various programming scenarios. Here are some practical applications:

1. **Encapsulation and Data Privacy**: Closures can encapsulate variables, preventing them from being accessed directly from outside the function. This is useful for creating private variables and methods.

2. **Partial Application and Currying**: Closures enable partial application and currying by allowing functions to be pre-configured with some arguments, returning a new function that takes the remaining arguments.

3. **Event Handling and Callbacks**: Closures are often used in event handling and callbacks, where they can capture and maintain state across asynchronous operations.

4. **Memoization**: Closures can be used to implement memoization, a technique for caching the results of expensive function calls to improve performance.

### Pseudocode Examples

Let's explore some pseudocode examples to demonstrate the power of closures and lexical scope.

#### Example 1: Encapsulation and Data Privacy

```pseudocode
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0  // Private variable

    return function() {
        count = count + 1
        return count
    }
}

let counter = createCounter()
print(counter())  // Output: 1
print(counter())  // Output: 2
```

In this example, the `createCounter` function returns a closure that has access to the `count` variable. The `count` variable is encapsulated within the closure, providing data privacy.

#### Example 2: Partial Application

```pseudocode
function add(x) {
    return function(y) {
        return x + y
    }
}

let addFive = add(5)
print(addFive(10))  // Output: 15
```

Here, the `add` function returns a closure that partially applies the `x` argument. The returned function takes the `y` argument and computes the sum.

#### Example 3: Memoization

```pseudocode
function memoize(fn) {
    let cache = {}

    return function(arg) {
        if (cache[arg] != null) {
            return cache[arg]
        } else {
            let result = fn(arg)
            cache[arg] = result
            return result
        }
    }
}

function slowFunction(x) {
    // Simulate a slow computation
    return x * x
}

let memoizedFunction = memoize(slowFunction)
print(memoizedFunction(5))  // Computed and cached
print(memoizedFunction(5))  // Retrieved from cache
```

In this example, the `memoize` function returns a closure that caches the results of the `slowFunction`, improving performance by avoiding redundant calculations.

### Visualizing Closure Execution

To visualize how closures retain access to their lexical scope, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Global Scope
    participant B as createCounter
    participant C as Closure

    A->>B: Call createCounter()
    B->>C: Return closure with access to count
    A->>C: Call closure()
    C->>A: Return count
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the global scope, the `createCounter` function, and the closure it returns. The closure retains access to the `count` variable, even after the `createCounter` function has completed execution.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of closures and lexical scope, try modifying the pseudocode examples provided:

1. **Modify the Counter**: Change the `createCounter` function to allow decrementing the counter as well. How does this affect the closure's behavior?

2. **Extend Partial Application**: Create a new function that uses partial application to multiply two numbers. How does this compare to the `add` function example?

3. **Enhance Memoization**: Modify the `memoize` function to handle multiple arguments. What changes are necessary to support this functionality?
