## 8.2. Functional Features in Python

Python is a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional programming (FP). While it is primarily known for its object-oriented capabilities, Python provides a rich set of features that enable developers to write functional code. In this section, we will explore Python's built-in higher-order functions, delve into functional libraries like Toolz and Funcy, and demonstrate how to translate functional programming patterns into Python.

### Built-in Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are a cornerstone of functional programming. They are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. Python includes several built-in higher-order functions that facilitate functional programming.

#### **map**

The `map` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator. This is useful for transforming data without using explicit loops.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)

print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `map` takes a lambda function that squares a number and applies it to each element in the `numbers` list.

#### **filter**

The `filter` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. It is commonly used to filter out unwanted data.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)

print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

Here, `filter` uses a lambda function to retain only the even numbers from the `numbers` list.

#### **reduce**

The `reduce` function, which is part of the `functools` module, applies a binary function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.

```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
factorial = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)

print(factorial)  # Output: 120
```

In this example, `reduce` multiplies the elements of the `numbers` list to compute the factorial.

### Functional Libraries

While Python's built-in functions provide a solid foundation for functional programming, libraries like Toolz and Funcy extend these capabilities, offering more advanced functional tools.

#### **Toolz**

Toolz is a library that provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions, and dictionaries. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

- **Currying**: Toolz supports currying, which allows you to fix a number of arguments to a function, producing another function.

```python
from toolz import curry

@curry
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

add_five = add(5)
print(add_five(10))  # Output: 15
```

- **Compose**: Toolz provides a `compose` function to combine multiple functions into a single function.

```python
from toolz import compose

def double(x):
    return x * 2

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

double_then_increment = compose(increment, double)
print(double_then_increment(3))  # Output: 7
```

#### **Funcy**

Funcy is another library that offers a collection of functional programming tools for Python. It focuses on providing concise and expressive functional utilities.

- **Partial Application**: Funcy allows for partial application of functions, similar to currying.

```python
from funcy import partial

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

double = partial(multiply, 2)
print(double(5))  # Output: 10
```

- **Lazy Evaluation**: Funcy supports lazy evaluation, enabling you to work with potentially infinite sequences.

```python
from funcy import ilazy

@ilazy
def count(start=0):
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1

print(list(count()[:5]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Pseudocode Comparisons

Translating functional programming patterns into Python involves understanding how to leverage Python's functional features effectively. Let's explore some common functional patterns and their Python implementations.

#### **Function Composition**

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. In Python, this can be achieved using the `compose` function from Toolz or by manually chaining functions.

```pseudocode
function compose(f, g):
    return function(x):
        return f(g(x))

function double(x):
    return x * 2

function increment(x):
    return x + 1

composed_function = compose(increment, double)
result = composed_function(3)  # Output: 7
```

In Python, we can use Toolz's `compose` as shown earlier or manually chain functions:

```python
def compose(f, g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

def double(x):
    return x * 2

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

composed_function = compose(increment, double)
print(composed_function(3))  # Output: 7
```

#### **Recursion**

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming, where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Python supports recursion, but it's important to be mindful of the recursion limit.

```pseudocode
function factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

result = factorial(5)  # Output: 120
```

In Python, the recursive factorial function looks like this:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

#### **Lazy Evaluation**

Lazy evaluation delays the computation of expressions until their values are needed. This can be useful for working with large or infinite data structures.

```pseudocode
function lazy_range(start, end):
    current = start
    while current < end:
        yield current
        current += 1

for number in lazy_range(0, 5):
    print(number)
```

In Python, lazy evaluation can be implemented using generators:

```python
def lazy_range(start, end):
    current = start
    while current < end:
        yield current
        current += 1

for number in lazy_range(0, 5):
    print(number)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples provided. For instance, change the lambda functions in `map` and `filter` to perform different operations, or experiment with creating your own higher-order functions. Explore the Toolz and Funcy libraries further by implementing more complex compositions and lazy evaluations.

### Visualizing Functional Concepts

To better understand how these functional features work together, let's visualize the flow of data through a series of transformations using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Data] --> B[map: Transform Data];
    B --> C[filter: Select Data];
    C --> D[reduce: Aggregate Data];
    D --> E[Output Result];
```

**Description:** This flowchart illustrates the process of transforming input data using `map`, selecting specific data with `filter`, aggregating the results with `reduce`, and producing the final output.
