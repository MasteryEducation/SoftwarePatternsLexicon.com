## 6.2. Trees and Graphs

In functional programming, trees and graphs are fundamental data structures that enable efficient data organization and manipulation. Their recursive nature aligns well with functional paradigms, allowing for elegant and concise implementations. In this section, we will explore the functional representation of trees and graphs, delve into traversal algorithms, and provide pseudocode implementations to navigate and manipulate these structures.

### Functional Representation

#### Building Recursive Data Structures

Functional programming emphasizes immutability and recursion, making it a natural fit for representing trees and graphs. Let's begin by understanding how these structures can be defined recursively.

**Trees**

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has zero or more child nodes. The topmost node is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves. In functional programming, trees can be represented using recursive data types.

**Binary Tree Example**

A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. Here's how we can define a binary tree in pseudocode:

```pseudocode
type BinaryTree = 
  | Empty
  | Node(value, left: BinaryTree, right: BinaryTree)
```

In this representation, a `BinaryTree` is either `Empty` or a `Node` containing a value and two subtrees (`left` and `right`).

**General Tree Example**

A general tree allows each node to have an arbitrary number of children. We can define it as follows:

```pseudocode
type Tree = 
  | Empty
  | Node(value, children: List<Tree>)
```

Here, a `Tree` is either `Empty` or a `Node` with a value and a list of child trees.

**Graphs**

Graphs are more complex structures consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They can be directed or undirected, and may contain cycles. In functional programming, graphs are often represented using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.

**Adjacency List Example**

An adjacency list represents a graph as a collection of lists, where each list corresponds to a node and contains the nodes it is connected to.

```pseudocode
type Graph = Map<Node, List<Node>>
```

In this representation, a `Graph` is a map where each node is associated with a list of adjacent nodes.

**Adjacency Matrix Example**

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where each cell `(i, j)` indicates the presence or absence of an edge between nodes `i` and `j`.

```pseudocode
type Graph = Matrix[Boolean]
```

### Traversal Algorithms

Traversal algorithms are essential for exploring trees and graphs. They allow us to visit each node in a specific order, enabling operations like searching, sorting, and modifying the structure.

#### Depth-First Traversal

Depth-first traversal explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or a stack.

**Depth-First Search (DFS) for Trees**

Here's a pseudocode implementation of DFS for a binary tree:

```pseudocode
function dfs(tree: BinaryTree):
  if tree is Empty:
    return
  print(tree.value)
  dfs(tree.left)
  dfs(tree.right)
```

In this implementation, we recursively visit the left and right subtrees after processing the current node.

**Depth-First Search (DFS) for Graphs**

For graphs, DFS can be implemented using a stack to keep track of visited nodes:

```pseudocode
function dfs(graph: Graph, start: Node):
  stack = [start]
  visited = Set()

  while stack is not empty:
    node = stack.pop()
    if node not in visited:
      print(node)
      visited.add(node)
      for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
          stack.push(neighbor)
```

#### Breadth-First Traversal

Breadth-first traversal explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is typically implemented using a queue.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Trees**

Here's a pseudocode implementation of BFS for a binary tree:

```pseudocode
function bfs(tree: BinaryTree):
  queue = [tree]

  while queue is not empty:
    node = queue.dequeue()
    if node is not Empty:
      print(node.value)
      queue.enqueue(node.left)
      queue.enqueue(node.right)
```

In this implementation, we use a queue to process nodes level by level.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Graphs**

For graphs, BFS can be implemented using a queue to explore nodes layer by layer:

```pseudocode
function bfs(graph: Graph, start: Node):
  queue = [start]
  visited = Set()

  while queue is not empty:
    node = queue.dequeue()
    if node not in visited:
      print(node)
      visited.add(node)
      for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
          queue.enqueue(neighbor)
```

### Pseudocode Implementations

#### Navigating and Manipulating Trees and Graphs

Functional programming allows us to elegantly navigate and manipulate trees and graphs using recursive functions and higher-order functions.

**Tree Manipulation Example**

Let's implement a function to calculate the sum of all values in a binary tree:

```pseudocode
function sumTree(tree: BinaryTree) -> Integer:
  if tree is Empty:
    return 0
  return tree.value + sumTree(tree.left) + sumTree(tree.right)
```

This function recursively calculates the sum by adding the value of the current node to the sums of the left and right subtrees.

**Graph Manipulation Example**

Consider a function to find all paths between two nodes in a graph:

```pseudocode
function findAllPaths(graph: Graph, start: Node, end: Node) -> List<List<Node>>:
  def dfs(current: Node, path: List<Node], paths: List<List<Node>>):
    path.append(current)
    if current == end:
      paths.append(path.copy())
    else:
      for neighbor in graph[current]:
        if neighbor not in path:
          dfs(neighbor, path, paths)
    path.pop()

  paths = []
  dfs(start, [], paths)
  return paths
```

This function uses a recursive helper function `dfs` to explore all possible paths from the start node to the end node.

### Visualizing Trees and Graphs

Visualizing trees and graphs can greatly enhance our understanding of these structures. Let's use Mermaid.js to create diagrams that illustrate the concepts we've discussed.

#### Binary Tree Visualization

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Root] --> B[Left Child];
    A --> C[Right Child];
    B --> D[Left Leaf];
    B --> E[Right Leaf];
    C --> F[Left Leaf];
    C --> G[Right Leaf];
```

*Caption: A simple binary tree with a root node and two levels of children.*

#### Graph Visualization

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Node A] --> B[Node B];
    A --> C[Node C];
    B --> D[Node D];
    C --> D;
    D --> A;
```

*Caption: A directed graph with nodes and edges illustrating connections.*
