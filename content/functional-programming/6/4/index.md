## 6.4. Functional Queues and Deques

In the realm of functional programming, data structures play a pivotal role in ensuring that our programs are both efficient and maintainable. Among these structures, queues and deques stand out due to their ability to manage collections of data with specific access patterns. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of functional queues and deques, exploring their efficient access patterns, understanding amortized time complexity, and providing pseudocode implementations to build persistent queues.

### Introduction to Queues and Deques

Queues and deques are fundamental data structures used to manage collections of elements. A **queue** is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure where elements are added to the back and removed from the front. A **deque** (double-ended queue) allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends, providing more flexibility.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Queue**: 
  - Operations: `enqueue` (add to back), `dequeue` (remove from front).
  - Access Pattern: FIFO.
  
- **Deque**:
  - Operations: `enqueueFront`, `enqueueBack`, `dequeueFront`, `dequeueBack`.
  - Access Pattern: Allows both FIFO and LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).

### Efficient Access Patterns

Functional programming emphasizes immutability, which can complicate the implementation of data structures like queues and deques. However, by leveraging persistent data structures, we can efficiently implement these structures while maintaining immutability.

#### Persistent Data Structures

A persistent data structure preserves the previous version of itself when modified. This is crucial in functional programming, where immutability is a core principle. Persistent queues and deques allow us to perform operations without altering the original structure, thus maintaining previous states.

#### Implementing Functional Queues

To implement a functional queue, we can use two lists: one for the front and one for the back. This approach allows us to efficiently manage the queue operations while maintaining immutability.

**Pseudocode for Functional Queue:**

```pseudocode
class FunctionalQueue:
    front: List
    back: List

    def __init__(self):
        self.front = []
        self.back = []

    def enqueue(self, element):
        return FunctionalQueue(self.front, [element] + self.back)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.front:
            if not self.back:
                raise Exception("Queue is empty")
            else:
                new_front = reverse(self.back)
                return FunctionalQueue(new_front[1:], [])
        else:
            return FunctionalQueue(self.front[1:], self.back)

    def peek(self):
        if not self.front:
            if not self.back:
                raise Exception("Queue is empty")
            else:
                new_front = reverse(self.back)
                return new_front[0]
        else:
            return self.front[0]

    def isEmpty(self):
        return not self.front and not self.back
```

**Explanation:**

- **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the back list, maintaining the order.
- **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front list. If the front list is empty, it reverses the back list to create a new front.
- **Peek**: Retrieves the front element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if both lists are empty.

### Amortized Time Complexity

Understanding the performance of our data structures is crucial. In functional queues, operations like `enqueue` and `dequeue` can be optimized using amortized analysis.

#### Amortized Analysis

Amortized analysis provides an average time per operation over a sequence of operations, smoothing out the cost of expensive operations. For functional queues, the amortized time complexity for `enqueue` and `dequeue` is O(1), despite the potential O(n) cost of reversing the back list.

**Why Amortized O(1)?**

- **Enqueue**: Directly adds to the back list, O(1).
- **Dequeue**: If the front list is empty, reversing the back list takes O(n). However, this reversal happens infrequently (only when the front is empty), spreading the cost over multiple operations.

### Pseudocode Implementations

Let's explore how to build persistent queues and deques using pseudocode.

#### Persistent Queue Implementation

The persistent queue uses two lists to manage elements efficiently.

```pseudocode
class PersistentQueue:
    front: List
    back: List

    def __init__(self, front=[], back=[]):
        self.front = front
        self.back = back

    def enqueue(self, element):
        return PersistentQueue(self.front, [element] + self.back)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.front:
            if not self.back:
                raise Exception("Queue is empty")
            else:
                new_front = reverse(self.back)
                return PersistentQueue(new_front[1:], [])
        else:
            return PersistentQueue(self.front[1:], self.back)

    def peek(self):
        if not self.front:
            if not self.back:
                raise Exception("Queue is empty")
            else:
                new_front = reverse(self.back)
                return new_front[0]
        else:
            return self.front[0]

    def isEmpty(self):
        return not self.front and not self.back
```

#### Persistent Deque Implementation

A persistent deque allows operations on both ends, requiring careful management of two lists.

```pseudocode
class PersistentDeque:
    front: List
    back: List

    def __init__(self, front=[], back=[]):
        self.front = front
        self.back = back

    def enqueueFront(self, element):
        return PersistentDeque([element] + self.front, self.back)

    def enqueueBack(self, element):
        return PersistentDeque(self.front, [element] + self.back)

    def dequeueFront(self):
        if not self.front:
            if not self.back:
                raise Exception("Deque is empty")
            else:
                new_front = reverse(self.back)
                return PersistentDeque(new_front[1:], [])
        else:
            return PersistentDeque(self.front[1:], self.back)

    def dequeueBack(self):
        if not self.back:
            if not self.front:
                raise Exception("Deque is empty")
            else:
                new_back = reverse(self.front)
                return PersistentDeque([], new_back[1:])
        else:
            return PersistentDeque(self.front, self.back[1:])

    def peekFront(self):
        if not self.front:
            if not self.back:
                raise Exception("Deque is empty")
            else:
                new_front = reverse(self.back)
                return new_front[0]
        else:
            return self.front[0]

    def peekBack(self):
        if not self.back:
            if not self.front:
                raise Exception("Deque is empty")
            else:
                new_back = reverse(self.front)
                return new_back[0]
        else:
            return self.back[0]

    def isEmpty(self):
        return not self.front and not self.back
```

### Visualizing Queue and Deque Operations

To better understand the operations of queues and deques, let's visualize them using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Queue Operations

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Enqueue Element]
    B --> C{Is Front Empty?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Reverse Back]
    C -->|No| E[Add to Back]
    D --> F[New Front]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Dequeue Element]
    G --> H{Is Queue Empty?}
    H -->|Yes| I[End]
    H -->|No| J[Continue]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the back.
- **Dequeue**: Checks if the front is empty, reverses the back if needed, and removes the front element.

#### Deque Operations

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Enqueue Front/Back]
    B --> C{Is Front/Back Empty?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Reverse Back/Front]
    C -->|No| E[Add to Front/Back]
    D --> F[New Front/Back]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Dequeue Front/Back]
    G --> H{Is Deque Empty?}
    H -->|Yes| I[End]
    H -->|No| J[Continue]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Enqueue Front/Back**: Adds an element to the respective end.
- **Dequeue Front/Back**: Checks if the respective end is empty, reverses if needed, and removes the element.
