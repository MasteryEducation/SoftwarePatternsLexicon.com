## 1.4. Functional Programming Languages and Ecosystems

Functional programming (FP) has become a cornerstone of modern software development, offering a paradigm that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions. In this section, we will explore the languages that embrace functional programming, the functional features in multi-paradigm languages, and the tooling and libraries that support FP patterns. This exploration will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the FP landscape and how it can be leveraged to build robust, maintainable software.

### Languages That Embrace FP

Functional programming languages are designed to facilitate the FP paradigm, providing features and constructs that make it easier to write functional code. Let's delve into some of the most prominent languages that embrace functional programming.

  - **Type System:** Haskell's type system is robust, with features like type inference and algebraic data types.

- **Sample Code Snippet:**

```pseudocode
-- Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(n) = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)

-- Usage
factorial(5)  -- Output: 120
```
