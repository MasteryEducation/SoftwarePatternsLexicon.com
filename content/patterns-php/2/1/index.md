## 2.1 Classes and Objects in PHP

In the realm of PHP development, understanding classes and objects is fundamental to mastering object-oriented programming (OOP). This section will guide you through the essential concepts of classes and objects, their relationship, and how they form the backbone of modern PHP applications.

### Understanding Classes as Blueprints for Objects

In PHP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have. Think of a class as a template or a prototype that outlines the structure and behavior of the objects.

#### Defining a Class

To define a class in PHP, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class, you can define properties (variables) and methods (functions) that belong to the class.

```php
<?php

class Car {
    // Properties
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;

    // Constructor
    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    // Method
    public function displayInfo() {
        return "Car: $this->make $this->model, Year: $this->year";
    }
}

?>
```

In this example, the `Car` class has three properties: `$make`, `$model`, and `$year`. It also includes a constructor method `__construct()` to initialize these properties and a method `displayInfo()` to return a string containing the car's information.

### Instantiating Objects in PHP

An object is an instance of a class. Once a class is defined, you can create objects from it. Each object can have its own values for the properties defined in the class.

#### Creating an Object

To create an object, use the `new` keyword followed by the class name.

```php
<?php

// Creating an object of the Car class
$myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);

// Accessing object properties and methods
echo $myCar->displayInfo(); // Outputs: Car: Toyota Corolla, Year: 2020

?>
```

Here, `$myCar` is an object of the `Car` class. We pass the make, model, and year to the constructor to initialize the object. We then call the `displayInfo()` method to display the car's information.

### The Relationship Between Classes and Objects

Classes and objects are closely related. A class serves as a blueprint, while objects are specific instances of that blueprint. Each object can have different values for its properties, but they share the same structure and behavior defined by the class.

#### Object-Oriented Principles

1. **Encapsulation**: Classes encapsulate data and behavior, providing a clear interface for interacting with objects.
2. **Abstraction**: Classes abstract complex functionality, allowing developers to work with higher-level concepts.
3. **Inheritance**: Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse.
4. **Polymorphism**: Objects can take on many forms, allowing for flexible and dynamic code.

### Code Examples

Let's explore more examples to solidify our understanding of classes and objects in PHP.

#### Example: Defining and Using a Class

```php
<?php

class Book {
    public $title;
    public $author;
    public $price;

    public function __construct($title, $author, $price) {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->author = $author;
        $this->price = $price;
    }

    public function getDetails() {
        return "Title: $this->title, Author: $this->author, Price: $$this->price";
    }
}

// Creating an object of the Book class
$book1 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 9.99);
echo $book1->getDetails(); // Outputs: Title: 1984, Author: George Orwell, Price: $9.99

?>
```

In this example, we define a `Book` class with properties for the title, author, and price. The `getDetails()` method returns a string with the book's details. We then create an object of the `Book` class and display its details.

#### Example: Using Inheritance

```php
<?php

class Vehicle {
    public $type;

    public function __construct($type) {
        $this->type = $type;
    }

    public function getType() {
        return "Vehicle Type: $this->type";
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public $make;
    public $model;

    public function __construct($type, $make, $model) {
        parent::__construct($type);
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
    }

    public function getCarDetails() {
        return $this->getType() . ", Make: $this->make, Model: $this->model";
    }
}

// Creating an object of the Car class
$car = new Car("Sedan", "Honda", "Civic");
echo $car->getCarDetails(); // Outputs: Vehicle Type: Sedan, Make: Honda, Model: Civic

?>
```

In this example, the `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class. The `Car` class adds additional properties and methods specific to cars. We use the `parent::__construct()` to call the parent class's constructor.

### Visualizing Classes and Objects

To better understand the relationship between classes and objects, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Car {
        -string make
        -string model
        -int year
        +__construct(string make, string model, int year)
        +displayInfo() string
    }
    Car <|-- myCar
```

This diagram represents the `Car` class with its properties and methods. The `myCar` object is an instance of the `Car` class.

### Key Takeaways

- **Classes** are blueprints for creating objects, defining properties and methods.
- **Objects** are instances of classes, each with its own values for the properties.
- **Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism** are core principles of OOP.
- **Inheritance** allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the properties and methods, or create your own classes and objects to see how they work in practice.
