## 12.7 Tools for Analyzing and Improving Legacy Code

Working with legacy code can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with large, complex systems that have evolved over time. However, with the right tools and techniques, you can analyze and improve legacy PHP code, making it more maintainable and robust. In this section, we'll explore several tools that can help you identify code smells, measure code metrics, and automate refactoring processes.

### Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining the code without executing it. This approach helps identify potential issues, code smells, and areas for improvement. Let's delve into some popular tools for static code analysis in PHP.

#### PHPStan

[PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) is a powerful static analysis tool for PHP that focuses on finding bugs in your code without running it. It provides a comprehensive analysis of your codebase, highlighting potential issues and suggesting improvements.

**Key Features of PHPStan:**

- **Type Safety:** PHPStan enforces strict type checks, helping you catch type-related errors early.
- **Custom Rules:** You can define custom rules to enforce coding standards specific to your project.
- **Integration:** PHPStan integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring continuous code quality checks.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Install PHPStan via Composer
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan

# Run PHPStan analysis
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src --level=max
```

In this example, PHPStan is configured to analyze the `src` directory at the maximum level of strictness, providing detailed insights into potential issues.

#### Psalm

[Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) is another static analysis tool for PHP that focuses on type safety and code quality. It offers a range of features to help you maintain a clean and error-free codebase.

**Key Features of Psalm:**

- **Type Inference:** Psalm infers types throughout your codebase, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
- **Plugin System:** Extend Psalm's functionality with custom plugins tailored to your project's needs.
- **Error Suppression:** Temporarily suppress errors to focus on critical issues first.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Install Psalm via Composer
composer require --dev vimeo/psalm

# Initialize Psalm configuration
vendor/bin/psalm --init

# Run Psalm analysis
vendor/bin/psalm
```

Psalm's analysis provides a detailed report of potential issues, helping you prioritize and address them effectively.

### Code Metrics

Code metrics provide quantitative measures of various aspects of your code, such as complexity, maintainability, and test coverage. These metrics are invaluable for assessing the health of your codebase and identifying areas for improvement.

#### PHP Depend

[PHP Depend](https://pdepend.org/) is a tool that generates software metrics for PHP projects. It helps you understand the structure and quality of your code, providing insights into potential areas for refactoring.

**Key Features of PHP Depend:**

- **Complexity Analysis:** Measure cyclomatic complexity to identify complex and hard-to-maintain code.
- **Maintainability Index:** Assess the maintainability of your codebase with a comprehensive index.
- **Visualization:** Generate visual reports to better understand code dependencies and structure.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Install PHP Depend via Composer
composer require --dev pdepend/pdepend

# Run PHP Depend analysis
vendor/bin/pdepend --jdepend-xml=build/jdepend.xml src
```

PHP Depend generates an XML report with detailed metrics, which you can use to guide your refactoring efforts.

### Automated Refactoring Tools

Automated refactoring tools assist in transforming your codebase, making it more maintainable and aligned with modern coding standards. These tools can save significant time and effort, especially when dealing with large codebases.

#### Rector

[Rector](https://getrector.org/) is an automated refactoring tool for PHP that helps you modernize your codebase. It applies a series of transformations to your code, ensuring it adheres to best practices and modern standards.

**Key Features of Rector:**

- **Rule-Based Refactoring:** Apply predefined or custom rules to refactor your code automatically.
- **Upgrade PHP Versions:** Easily upgrade your codebase to newer PHP versions with minimal manual intervention.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate Rector into your CI/CD pipeline for ongoing code improvements.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Install Rector via Composer
composer require rector/rector --dev

# Run Rector with a specific set of rules
vendor/bin/rector process src --set php74
```

In this example, Rector is configured to apply transformations suitable for PHP 7.4, helping you modernize your codebase efficiently.

### Visualizing Code Dependencies

Understanding the dependencies within your codebase is crucial for effective refactoring. Visualizing these dependencies can provide insights into the structure and complexity of your code.
