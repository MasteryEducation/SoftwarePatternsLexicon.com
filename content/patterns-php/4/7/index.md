## 4.7 Functional Programming Patterns in PHP

Functional programming (FP) is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. PHP, traditionally known for its imperative and object-oriented capabilities, has increasingly embraced functional programming concepts. In this section, we will explore some of the key functional programming patterns in PHP, including functors, monads, and pipelines, and demonstrate how they can be applied to create more efficient and maintainable code.

### Introduction to Functional Programming Patterns

Functional programming patterns provide a way to structure code that emphasizes immutability, higher-order functions, and function composition. These patterns can lead to code that is easier to reason about, test, and maintain. Let's delve into some of the most significant functional programming patterns in PHP.

### Functors in PHP

#### What is a Functor?

A functor is a design pattern that allows you to apply a function over a wrapped value. In PHP, a functor is typically implemented as an object that implements a `map` method. This method takes a function as an argument and applies it to the wrapped value, returning a new functor with the transformed value.

#### Implementing a Functor in PHP

Let's create a simple functor in PHP:

```php
<?php

class Functor {
    private $value;

    public function __construct($value) {
        $this->value = $value;
    }

    public function map(callable $fn) {
        return new self($fn($this->value));
    }

    public function getValue() {
        return $this->value;
    }
}

// Usage
$number = new Functor(5);
$result = $number->map(fn($x) => $x * 2)->map(fn($x) => $x + 3);

echo $result->getValue(); // Outputs: 13
```

In this example, the `Functor` class wraps a value and provides a `map` method to apply a function to the wrapped value. The `map` method returns a new instance of the functor with the transformed value.

#### Key Characteristics of Functors

- **Immutability**: Functors do not modify the original value; they return a new functor with the transformed value.
- **Function Application**: Functors allow you to apply functions to wrapped values in a consistent manner.

### Monads in PHP

#### What is a Monad?

Monads are a more advanced functional programming pattern that builds upon functors. A monad is a design pattern that represents computations as a series of steps. It provides a way to chain operations together, handling the context of the computation (such as error handling or asynchronous operations) automatically.

#### Implementing a Monad in PHP

Let's implement a simple monad in PHP:

```php
<?php

class Monad {
    private $value;

    public function __construct($value) {
        $this->value = $value;
    }

    public function bind(callable $fn) {
        return $fn($this->value);
    }

    public static function of($value) {
        return new self($value);
    }
}

// Usage
$monad = Monad::of(5);
$result = $monad->bind(fn($x) => Monad::of($x * 2))
                ->bind(fn($x) => Monad::of($x + 3));

echo $result->bind(fn($x) => $x); // Outputs: 13
```

In this example, the `Monad` class provides a `bind` method to chain operations together. The `bind` method takes a function that returns a monad, allowing you to chain multiple operations.

#### Key Characteristics of Monads

- **Chaining**: Monads allow you to chain operations together, handling the context of the computation automatically.
- **Context Management**: Monads manage the context of the computation, such as error handling or asynchronous operations.

### Pipelines and Function Composition

#### What is a Pipeline?

A pipeline is a design pattern that allows you to chain functions together, passing the output of one function as the input to the next. Pipelines are a powerful way to compose functions and create complex operations from simple building blocks.

#### Implementing a Pipeline in PHP

Let's implement a simple pipeline in PHP:

```php
<?php

class Pipeline {
    private $stages;

    public function __construct(array $stages = []) {
        $this->stages = $stages;
    }

    public function pipe(callable $stage) {
        $this->stages[] = $stage;
        return $this;
    }

    public function process($input) {
        return array_reduce($this->stages, fn($carry, $stage) => $stage($carry), $input);
    }
}

// Usage
$pipeline = (new Pipeline())
    ->pipe(fn($x) => $x * 2)
    ->pipe(fn($x) => $x + 3);

$result = $pipeline->process(5);

echo $result; // Outputs: 13
```

In this example, the `Pipeline` class allows you to chain functions together using the `pipe` method. The `process` method applies each function in the pipeline to the input value.

#### Key Characteristics of Pipelines

- **Function Composition**: Pipelines allow you to compose functions together, creating complex operations from simple building blocks.
- **Flexibility**: Pipelines provide a flexible way to chain functions together, allowing you to easily modify the sequence of operations.

### Real-World Applications of Functional Programming Patterns

Functional programming patterns can be applied to a wide range of real-world applications, from data processing to web development. Here are a few examples:

#### Data Processing

Functional programming patterns are well-suited for data processing tasks, where you need to apply a series of transformations to a dataset. For example, you can use a pipeline to process a CSV file, applying a series of transformations to each row.

#### Web Development

In web development, functional programming patterns can be used to create more maintainable and testable code. For example, you can use functors and monads to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.

#### Error Handling

Monads are particularly useful for handling errors in a functional programming style. You can use a monad to represent a computation that may fail, chaining operations together and handling errors automatically.

### Visualizing Functional Programming Patterns

To better understand how these patterns work, let's visualize the flow of data through a pipeline using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Value] -->|pipe(fn1)| B[Stage 1: fn1];
    B -->|pipe(fn2)| C[Stage 2: fn2];
    C -->|pipe(fn3)| D[Stage 3: fn3];
    D --> E[Output Value];
```

In this diagram, the input value is passed through a series of stages, each represented by a function (`fn1`, `fn2`, `fn3`). The output of each stage is passed as the input to the next stage, resulting in the final output value.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored some of the key functional programming patterns in PHP, it's time to try them out for yourself. Here are a few suggestions for experimenting with these patterns:

- **Modify the Functor Example**: Try adding additional transformations to the functor example, such as applying a square root function or a logarithm function.
- **Extend the Monad Example**: Implement a monad that handles error cases, such as a division by zero error.
- **Create a Complex Pipeline**: Build a pipeline that processes a dataset, applying a series of transformations to each element.

### Summary

In this section, we've explored some of the key functional programming patterns in PHP, including functors, monads, and pipelines. These patterns provide powerful tools for creating efficient and maintainable code, allowing you to compose functions, manage context, and chain operations together. By applying these patterns to real-world applications, you can create more robust and flexible software.
