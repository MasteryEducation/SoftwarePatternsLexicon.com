## 4.2 Functional Programming Features in PHP

Functional programming (FP) is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. PHP, traditionally known for its imperative and object-oriented capabilities, has embraced functional programming features over the years. This section will delve into these features, focusing on first-class functions, higher-order functions, immutability, recursion, and pure functions.

### First-Class Functions and Higher-Order Functions

#### First-Class Functions

In PHP, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This capability allows for more flexible and reusable code.

**Example: Assigning a Function to a Variable**

```php
<?php

// Define a simple function
function greet($name) {
    return "Hello, $name!";
}

// Assign the function to a variable
$greeter = 'greet';

// Call the function using the variable
echo $greeter('World'); // Outputs: Hello, World!

?>
```

**Explanation:** Here, the `greet` function is assigned to the `$greeter` variable, demonstrating PHP's support for first-class functions.

#### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are a cornerstone of functional programming, enabling powerful abstractions and code reuse.

**Example: Using a Higher-Order Function**

```php
<?php

// Define a higher-order function
function applyFunction($func, $value) {
    return $func($value);
}

// Define a simple function
function square($n) {
    return $n * $n;
}

// Use the higher-order function
echo applyFunction('square', 4); // Outputs: 16

?>
```

**Explanation:** The `applyFunction` is a higher-order function that takes another function (`square`) and a value as arguments, applying the function to the value.

### Immutability and Its Importance in FP

Immutability refers to the concept of data that cannot be changed after it is created. In functional programming, immutability is crucial because it helps avoid side effects and makes code easier to reason about.

#### Implementing Immutability in PHP

While PHP does not enforce immutability, developers can adopt practices to simulate it, such as using constants or creating new instances instead of modifying existing ones.

**Example: Simulating Immutability**

```php
<?php

class ImmutablePoint {
    private $x;
    private $y;

    public function __construct($x, $y) {
        $this->x = $x;
        $this->y = $y;
    }

    public function withX($x) {
        return new self($x, $this->y);
    }

    public function withY($y) {
        return new self($this->x, $y);
    }

    public function getX() {
        return $this->x;
    }

    public function getY() {
        return $this->y;
    }
}

$point = new ImmutablePoint(1, 2);
$newPoint = $point->withX(3);

echo $point->getX(); // Outputs: 1
echo $newPoint->getX(); // Outputs: 3

?>
```

**Explanation:** The `ImmutablePoint` class demonstrates immutability by returning new instances with modified values instead of altering the original object.

### Recursion and Pure Functions

#### Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is often used in functional programming to replace iterative loops.

**Example: Recursive Function to Calculate Factorial**

```php
<?php

function factorial($n) {
    if ($n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return $n * factorial($n - 1);
}

echo factorial(5); // Outputs: 120

?>
```

**Explanation:** The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion, calling itself with a decremented value until it reaches the base case.

#### Pure Functions

Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. They are a fundamental concept in functional programming, promoting predictability and testability.

**Example: Pure Function**

```php
<?php

function add($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}

echo add(2, 3); // Outputs: 5

?>
```

**Explanation:** The `add` function is pure because it consistently returns the same result for the same inputs and does not modify any external state.

### Visualizing Functional Programming Concepts

To better understand these concepts, let's visualize how functions interact in a functional programming context.

```mermaid

    A[First-Class Functions] --> B[Higher-Order Functions];
    B --> C[Immutability];
    C --> D[Recursion];
    D --> E[Pure Functions];
    E --> A;
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the `applyFunction` example to use different functions, or create your own immutable class. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of functional programming in PHP.
