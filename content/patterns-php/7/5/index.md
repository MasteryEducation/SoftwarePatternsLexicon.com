## 7.5 Mediator Pattern

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object to encapsulate how a set of objects interact. By promoting loose coupling, it allows objects to communicate without directly referencing each other, thus reducing dependencies and enhancing maintainability.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Mediator Pattern is to centralize complex communication and control logic between related objects. Instead of having objects refer to each other explicitly, they communicate through a mediator. This approach simplifies object protocols, prevents tight coupling, and enhances the flexibility of the system.

### Key Participants

1. **Mediator**: Defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects.
2. **ConcreteMediator**: Implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects.
3. **Colleague**: Each Colleague class knows its Mediator object and communicates with it whenever it would have otherwise communicated with another Colleague.

### Applicability

Use the Mediator Pattern when:

- A set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways.
- Reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects.
- A behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing.

### Implementing Mediator in PHP

To implement the Mediator Pattern in PHP, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Mediator Interface**: This interface will declare the methods used for communication between Colleague objects.
2. **Create Concrete Mediator**: Implement the Mediator interface and manage the communication between Colleague objects.
3. **Define Colleague Classes**: These classes will interact with each other through the Mediator.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's consider a chat room scenario where users can send messages to each other through a central mediator.

#### Step 1: Define the Mediator Interface

```php
<?php

interface ChatMediator {
    public function showMessage(User $user, string $message);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Mediator

```php
<?php

class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    public function showMessage(User $user, string $message) {
        $time = date('H:i');
        $username = $user->getName();
        echo "$time [$username]: $message\n";
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define Colleague Classes

```php
<?php

class User {
    private $name;
    private $chatMediator;

    public function __construct(string $name, ChatMediator $chatMediator) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->chatMediator = $chatMediator;
    }

    public function getName(): string {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function sendMessage(string $message) {
        $this->chatMediator->showMessage($this, $message);
    }
}
```

#### Usage Example

```php
<?php

$mediator = new ChatRoom();

$user1 = new User("Alice", $mediator);
$user2 = new User("Bob", $mediator);

$user1->sendMessage("Hello, Bob!");
$user2->sendMessage("Hi, Alice!");
```

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ChatMediator {
        <<interface>>
        +showMessage(User, string)
    }
    class ChatRoom {
        +showMessage(User, string)
    }
    class User {
        -name : string
        -chatMediator : ChatMediator
        +__construct(string, ChatMediator)
        +getName() : string
        +sendMessage(string)
    }

    ChatMediator <|-- ChatRoom
    User --> ChatMediator
```

### Design Considerations

- **Decoupling**: The Mediator Pattern effectively decouples the colleagues, allowing them to vary independently.
- **Complexity**: While it simplifies communication, it can introduce a single point of control that might become complex.
- **Flexibility**: It allows for easy addition of new colleague classes without altering existing code.

### PHP Unique Features

- **Type Declarations**: PHP allows for strict typing, which can be leveraged in the Mediator Pattern to ensure type safety.
- **Anonymous Classes**: PHP's anonymous classes can be used for quick implementations of mediators or colleagues for testing purposes.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Mediator vs. Observer**: While both patterns promote loose coupling, the Mediator centralizes communication, whereas the Observer pattern allows for dynamic subscription to events.
- **Mediator vs. Facade**: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a subsystem, while the Mediator pattern centralizes communication between objects.

### Use Cases and Examples

- **GUI Component Interactions**: In GUI applications, the Mediator Pattern can manage interactions between buttons, text fields, and other components.
- **Chat Room Implementations**: As demonstrated, chat applications can use the Mediator Pattern to manage message exchanges between users.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by adding more users or modifying the message format. Try implementing additional features like private messaging or user status updates.
