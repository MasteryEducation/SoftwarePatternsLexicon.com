## 7.15 Event Sourcing Pattern

### Intent

The Event Sourcing Pattern is a powerful design pattern that focuses on storing changes to an application's state as a sequence of events. This approach allows developers to reconstruct the state of an application at any point in time by replaying these events. It is particularly useful for applications that require auditing, temporal queries, and complex data histories.

### Understanding Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a design pattern where state changes are captured as a series of events. Instead of storing just the current state of an entity, every change is recorded as an event. This allows for a complete history of changes, enabling the reconstruction of past states and the ability to audit changes over time.

#### Key Concepts

- **Event**: A record of a change in state. Events are immutable and represent facts that have occurred in the system.
- **Event Store**: A database or storage system that holds all events. It acts as the source of truth for the application's state.
- **Event Replay**: The process of reconstructing the current state by replaying all events from the event store.
- **Projection**: A derived view of the event data, often used to create read models or views for querying.

### Implementing Event Sourcing in PHP

Implementing Event Sourcing in PHP involves several steps, including recording events, storing them in an event store, and replaying them to reconstruct the state.

#### Recording Events

Events are typically recorded as objects that encapsulate the details of the change. Each event should include information such as the type of change, the entity affected, and any relevant data.

```php
<?php

class UserRegisteredEvent
{
    private string $userId;
    private string $email;
    private DateTimeImmutable $occurredOn;

    public function __construct(string $userId, string $email)
    {
        $this->userId = $userId;
        $this->email = $email;
        $this->occurredOn = new DateTimeImmutable();
    }

    public function getUserId(): string
    {
        return $this->userId;
    }

    public function getEmail(): string
    {
        return $this->email;
    }

    public function getOccurredOn(): DateTimeImmutable
    {
        return $this->occurredOn;
    }
}
```

#### Storing Events

Events are stored in an event store, which can be implemented using a database or a specialized event storage system. Each event is stored with its metadata, such as the timestamp and event type.

```php
<?php

class EventStore
{
    private array $events = [];

    public function append(Event $event): void
    {
        $this->events[] = $event;
    }

    public function getEvents(): array
    {
        return $this->events;
    }
}
```

#### Replaying Events

To reconstruct the state of an entity, events are replayed in the order they occurred. This involves applying each event to an initial state to derive the current state.

```php
<?php

class User
{
    private string $userId;
    private string $email;

    public function apply(UserRegisteredEvent $event): void
    {
        $this->userId = $event->getUserId();
        $this->email = $event->getEmail();
    }
}

function replayEvents(array $events): User
{
    $user = new User();
    foreach ($events as $event) {
        $user->apply($event);
    }
    return $user;
}
```

### Use Cases and Examples

Event Sourcing is particularly beneficial in scenarios where a detailed history of changes is required. Some common use cases include:

- **Auditing**: Event Sourcing provides a complete audit trail of changes, making it easy to track who made changes and when.
- **Temporal Queries**: By replaying events, you can reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time, enabling temporal queries.
- **Complex Data Histories**: Applications with complex data histories, such as financial systems, can benefit from the detailed event logs.

### Visualizing Event Sourcing

To better understand how Event Sourcing works, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant EventStore
    participant Application

    User->>Application: Register User
    Application->>EventStore: Store UserRegisteredEvent
    Application->>User: Confirmation

    Note over EventStore: Event Store contains all events

    Application->>EventStore: Replay Events
    EventStore->>Application: Return Events
    Application->>User: Reconstruct State
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing Event Sourcing, consider the following:

- **Event Versioning**: As your application evolves, you may need to change the structure of events. Implement versioning to handle changes gracefully.
- **Performance**: Replaying a large number of events can be resource-intensive. Consider using snapshots to reduce the number of events that need to be replayed.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that events are stored consistently and that the event store is the single source of truth.

### PHP Unique Features

PHP offers several features that can be leveraged when implementing Event Sourcing:

- **Anonymous Classes**: Use anonymous classes to create lightweight event handlers.
- **Traits**: Use traits to share common event handling logic across multiple classes.
- **Namespaces**: Organize your event classes and handlers using PHP namespaces for better code organization.

### Differences and Similarities

Event Sourcing is often confused with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern. While both patterns can be used together, they serve different purposes. Event Sourcing focuses on storing state changes as events, while CQRS separates read and write operations.

### Try It Yourself
