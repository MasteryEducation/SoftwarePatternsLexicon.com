## 7.1 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles it. This pattern promotes loose coupling in your code by allowing you to chain multiple handlers together without the sender needing to know which handler will process the request.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to decouple the sender of a request from its receivers by allowing more than one object to handle the request. This is achieved by chaining the receiving objects and passing the request along the chain until an object handles it.

### Key Participants

1. **Handler**: Defines an interface for handling requests and optionally implements the successor link.
2. **ConcreteHandler**: Handles requests it is responsible for and forwards requests to the next handler if it cannot handle the request.
3. **Client**: Initiates the request to a handler in the chain.

### Applicability

Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when:

- You have multiple objects that can handle a request, and you want to leave it to the handler objects to decide who handles the request.
- You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
- The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.

### Implementing Chain of Responsibility in PHP

Let's explore how to implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern in PHP by creating a simple logging system where different loggers handle different levels of logging messages.

#### Step 1: Define the Handler Interface

First, we define a `Logger` interface that declares a method for handling requests and a method for setting the next handler in the chain.

```php
<?php

interface Logger
{
    public function setNext(Logger $logger): Logger;
    public function log(string $message, int $level): void;
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Handlers

Next, we create concrete handlers that implement the `Logger` interface. Each handler will process the request if it meets certain criteria or pass it to the next handler.

```php
<?php

class InfoLogger implements Logger
{
    private ?Logger $nextLogger = null;

    public function setNext(Logger $logger): Logger
    {
        $this->nextLogger = $logger;
        return $logger;
    }

    public function log(string $message, int $level): void
    {
        if ($level === 1) {
            echo "Info: $message\n";
        } elseif ($this->nextLogger !== null) {
            $this->nextLogger->log($message, $level);
        }
    }
}

class ErrorLogger implements Logger
{
    private ?Logger $nextLogger = null;

    public function setNext(Logger $logger): Logger
    {
        $this->nextLogger = $logger;
        return $logger;
    }

    public function log(string $message, int $level): void
    {
        if ($level === 2) {
            echo "Error: $message\n";
        } elseif ($this->nextLogger !== null) {
            $this->nextLogger->log($message, $level);
        }
    }
}

class DebugLogger implements Logger
{
    private ?Logger $nextLogger = null;

    public function setNext(Logger $logger): Logger
    {
        $this->nextLogger = $logger;
        return $logger;
    }

    public function log(string $message, int $level): void
    {
        if ($level === 3) {
            echo "Debug: $message\n";
        } elseif ($this->nextLogger !== null) {
            $this->nextLogger->log($message, $level);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure the Chain

Now, we configure the chain of loggers. The client will initiate the request to the first logger in the chain.

```php
<?php

$infoLogger = new InfoLogger();
$errorLogger = new ErrorLogger();
$debugLogger = new DebugLogger();

$infoLogger->setNext($errorLogger)->setNext($debugLogger);

// Client code
$infoLogger->log("This is an information.", 1);
$infoLogger->log("This is an error.", 2);
$infoLogger->log("This is a debug message.", 3);
```

### Visualizing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of a request through the chain of responsibility:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] -->|Request| B[InfoLogger]
    B -->|Pass| C[ErrorLogger]
    C -->|Pass| D[DebugLogger]
    B -->|Handle| E[Info Handling]
    C -->|Handle| F[Error Handling]
    D -->|Handle| G[Debug Handling]
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is widely used in various scenarios, including:

- **Event Handling Systems**: In GUI applications, event handling can be managed by passing events through a chain of handlers until one of them processes the event.
- **Logging Mechanisms**: As demonstrated in the example above, different loggers can handle different levels of logging messages.
- **Middleware in Web Applications**: HTTP requests can be processed by a chain of middleware components, each performing a specific task such as authentication, logging, or data transformation.

### Design Considerations

- **Flexibility**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects. You can easily add or remove handlers from the chain.
- **Performance**: Be cautious of performance implications, as requests may pass through many handlers before being processed.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that requests are eventually handled, or provide a default handler to catch unhandled requests.

### PHP Unique Features

PHP's dynamic nature and support for anonymous functions and closures make it easy to implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern. You can use closures to define handlers inline, providing a more concise and flexible implementation.

### Differences and Similarities

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is often confused with the Decorator pattern. While both involve chaining objects, the Decorator pattern focuses on adding behavior to objects, whereas the Chain of Responsibility pattern focuses on passing requests along a chain of handlers.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Chain of Responsibility pattern by modifying the code examples:

- Add a new logger for a different log level.
- Change the order of the loggers in the chain.
- Implement a default handler that logs unhandled requests to a file.
