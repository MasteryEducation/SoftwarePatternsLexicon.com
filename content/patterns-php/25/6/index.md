## 25.6 Functional Programming Concepts in PHP

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. While PHP is traditionally known as an object-oriented language, it has evolved to incorporate functional programming concepts, allowing developers to write cleaner, more maintainable code. In this section, we will explore the key concepts of functional programming in PHP, including first-class functions, higher-order functions, and the use of functional libraries.

### Introduction to Functional Programming in PHP

Functional programming emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. This paradigm encourages immutability and stateless functions, which can lead to code that is easier to reason about and test.

#### Key Concepts

- **First-Class Functions:** Functions in PHP can be treated like any other variable. They can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
- **Anonymous Functions:** Also known as closures, these are functions without a name. They can capture variables from their surrounding scope.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Immutability:** The concept of not modifying data after it has been created. Instead, new data structures are created with the desired changes.
- **Pure Functions:** Functions that have no side effects and return the same output given the same input.

### First-Class Functions in PHP

In PHP, functions are first-class citizens. This means you can assign them to variables, pass them as arguments, and return them from other functions. This flexibility allows for powerful abstractions and code reuse.

#### Example: Assigning Functions to Variables

```php
<?php

// Assigning a function to a variable
$square = function($x) {
    return $x * $x;
};

// Using the function
echo $square(4); // Outputs: 16
?>
```

In this example, we define an anonymous function that calculates the square of a number and assign it to the variable `$square`. We can then call this function using the variable name.

### Anonymous Functions and Closures

Anonymous functions, or closures, are functions without a name. They can capture variables from their surrounding scope, making them useful for callbacks and functional programming.

#### Example: Using Closures

```php
<?php

$factor = 10;

// Define a closure that uses a variable from the outer scope
$multiply = function($x) use ($factor) {
    return $x * $factor;
};

echo $multiply(5); // Outputs: 50
?>
```

In this example, the closure `$multiply` captures the variable `$factor` from its surrounding scope. This allows the closure to use `$factor` even though it is not passed as an argument.

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are a key feature of functional programming, enabling powerful abstractions and code reuse.

#### Example: Using Higher-Order Functions

```php
<?php

// A function that applies a given function to each element of an array
function map(array $arr, callable $func) {
    $result = [];
    foreach ($arr as $item) {
        $result[] = $func($item);
    }
    return $result;
}

// Using the map function with an anonymous function
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$squaredNumbers = map($numbers, function($n) {
    return $n * $n;
});

print_r($squaredNumbers); // Outputs: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 4 [2] => 9 [3] => 16 [4] => 25 )
?>
```

In this example, the `map` function is a higher-order function that takes an array and a callable function as arguments. It applies the callable function to each element of the array, returning a new array with the results.

### Immutability and Pure Functions

Immutability is a core concept in functional programming. It involves creating new data structures instead of modifying existing ones. Pure functions are functions that do not have side effects and return the same output given the same input.

#### Example: Immutability and Pure Functions

```php
<?php

// A pure function that does not modify the input array
function addOneToEach(array $numbers) {
    $result = [];
    foreach ($numbers as $number) {
        $result[] = $number + 1;
    }
    return $result;
}

$originalNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
$newNumbers = addOneToEach($originalNumbers);

print_r($originalNumbers); // Outputs: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 2 [2] => 3 )
print_r($newNumbers); // Outputs: Array ( [0] => 2 [1] => 3 [2] => 4 )
?>
```

In this example, the function `addOneToEach` is a pure function. It does not modify the input array but returns a new array with each element incremented by one.

### Functional Libraries in PHP

PHP has several libraries that facilitate functional programming. One popular library is [Functional PHP](https://github.com/lstrojny/functional-php), which provides a set of functional primitives for PHP.

#### Using Functional PHP

Functional PHP offers a variety of functions for working with arrays, collections, and more. It allows you to write more expressive and concise code.

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use function Functional\map;

// Using Functional PHP to map over an array
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$squaredNumbers = map($numbers, function($n) {
    return $n * $n;
});

print_r($squaredNumbers); // Outputs: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 4 [2] => 9 [3] => 16 [4] => 25 )
?>
```

In this example, we use the `map` function from the Functional PHP library to apply a function to each element of an array. This is similar to the earlier example but uses the library's implementation.

### Benefits of Functional Programming in PHP

Functional programming offers several benefits, including:

- **Easier to Reason About:** Functional code is often easier to understand because it avoids side effects and mutable state.
- **Improved Testability:** Pure functions are easier to test because they do not depend on or modify external state.
- **Enhanced Reusability:** Higher-order functions and first-class functions enable powerful abstractions and code reuse.
- **Concurrency:** Immutability and stateless functions make it easier to write concurrent and parallel code.

### Visualizing Functional Programming Concepts

To better understand the flow of functional programming in PHP, let's visualize the process of using higher-order functions and closures.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Define Function]
    B --> C[Assign to Variable]
    C --> D[Pass as Argument]
    D --> E[Return from Function]
    E --> F[Execute Function]
    F --> G[End]
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of using functions as first-class citizens in PHP. We start by defining a function, assigning it to a variable, passing it as an argument, returning it from another function, and finally executing it.
