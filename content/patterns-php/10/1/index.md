## 10.1 Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern

In the realm of software design patterns, the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern stands out as a critical tool for managing data access logic in a structured and efficient manner. This pattern is particularly useful in PHP applications where database interaction is a common requirement. By abstracting and encapsulating all access to the data source, the DAO pattern provides a simple API that promotes code reuse and maintainability.

### Intent

The primary intent of the DAO pattern is to separate the data access logic from the business logic of an application. This separation allows developers to focus on the core functionality of their application without being bogged down by the intricacies of database interactions. By providing a clear and consistent API for data access, the DAO pattern simplifies the process of performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database.

### Key Participants

1. **DAO Interface**: Defines the standard operations to be performed on a model object(s).
2. **Concrete DAO Class**: Implements the DAO interface and interacts with the data source.
3. **Model/Entity Class**: Represents the data structure that the DAO will manage.
4. **Client**: Uses the DAO to perform data operations.

### Applicability

The DAO pattern is applicable in scenarios where:
- You need to separate data access logic from business logic.
- You want to promote code reuse and maintainability.
- You are working with multiple data sources or databases.
- You need to implement a consistent API for data operations.

### Implementing DAO in PHP

Let's delve into the implementation of the DAO pattern in PHP. We'll create a simple application that manages a list of users in a database. This example will demonstrate how to create DAO classes for each data entity and implement CRUD operations.

#### Step 1: Define the Model Class

The model class represents the data structure that the DAO will manage. In this case, we'll create a `User` class.

```php
<?php

class User {
    private $id;
    private $name;
    private $email;

    public function __construct($id, $name, $email) {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    public function getId() {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function getEmail() {
        return $this->email;
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the DAO Interface

The DAO interface defines the standard operations to be performed on the `User` object.

```php
<?php

interface UserDAO {
    public function getUserById($id);
    public function getAllUsers();
    public function insertUser(User $user);
    public function updateUser(User $user);
    public function deleteUser($id);
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Concrete DAO Class

The concrete DAO class implements the DAO interface and interacts with the database. We'll use PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction.

```php
<?php

class UserDAOImpl implements UserDAO {
    private $pdo;

    public function __construct(PDO $pdo) {
        $this->pdo = $pdo;
    }

    public function getUserById($id) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id");
        $stmt->bindParam(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $stmt->execute();
        $row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

        if ($row) {
            return new User($row['id'], $row['name'], $row['email']);
        }

        return null;
    }

    public function getAllUsers() {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->query("SELECT * FROM users");
        $users = [];

        while ($row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
            $users[] = new User($row['id'], $row['name'], $row['email']);
        }

        return $users;
    }

    public function insertUser(User $user) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (:name, :email)");
        $stmt->bindParam(':name', $user->getName());
        $stmt->bindParam(':email', $user->getEmail());
        $stmt->execute();
    }

    public function updateUser(User $user) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("UPDATE users SET name = :name, email = :email WHERE id = :id");
        $stmt->bindParam(':name', $user->getName());
        $stmt->bindParam(':email', $user->getEmail());
        $stmt->bindParam(':id', $user->getId(), PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $stmt->execute();
    }

    public function deleteUser($id) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("DELETE FROM users WHERE id = :id");
        $stmt->bindParam(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $stmt->execute();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Using the DAO

Now that we have our DAO implemented, we can use it to perform data operations.

```php
<?php

// Database connection
$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb', 'username', 'password');

// Create DAO
$userDAO = new UserDAOImpl($pdo);

// Insert a new user
$newUser = new User(null, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
$userDAO->insertUser($newUser);

// Get all users
$users = $userDAO->getAllUsers();
foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->getName() . " - " . $user->getEmail() . "\n";
}

// Update a user
$existingUser = $userDAO->getUserById(1);
if ($existingUser) {
    $existingUser = new User($existingUser->getId(), 'Jane Doe', 'jane.doe@example.com');
    $userDAO->updateUser($existingUser);
}

// Delete a user
$userDAO->deleteUser(2);
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use the DAO pattern when you need to separate data access logic from business logic, especially in applications with complex data interactions.
- **Considerations**: Ensure that the DAO layer is well-defined and consistent. Avoid mixing business logic with data access logic within the DAO.

### PHP Unique Features

PHP offers several features that make implementing the DAO pattern straightforward:
- **PDO**: PHP Data Objects provide a consistent interface for accessing databases, making it easier to implement DAOs.
- **Type Hinting**: PHP's type hinting allows for more robust and error-free code, especially when dealing with complex data structures.

### Differences and Similarities

The DAO pattern is often confused with the Repository pattern. While both patterns deal with data access, the Repository pattern is more focused on the business logic layer and often includes domain-specific operations.

### Visualizing the DAO Pattern

To better understand the DAO pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the different components using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +int id
        +string name
        +string email
        +getId()
        +getName()
        +getEmail()
    }

    class UserDAO {
        <<interface>>
        +getUserById(id)
        +getAllUsers()
        +insertUser(user)
        +updateUser(user)
        +deleteUser(id)
    }

    class UserDAOImpl {
        -PDO pdo
        +getUserById(id)
        +getAllUsers()
        +insertUser(user)
        +updateUser(user)
        +deleteUser(id)
    }

    UserDAOImpl --> UserDAO
    UserDAOImpl --> User
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The DAO pattern is widely used in applications that require a clear separation between data access and business logic. Here are some common use cases:

- **Enterprise Applications**: Large-scale applications with complex data interactions benefit from the DAO pattern's ability to simplify data access logic.
- **Web Applications**: PHP-based web applications often use the DAO pattern to manage database interactions in a structured manner.
- **Microservices**: In a microservices architecture, the DAO pattern can be used to manage data access for individual services, promoting modularity and reusability.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of the DAO pattern, it's time to experiment with the code. Try modifying the `UserDAOImpl` class to add additional methods, such as searching for users by name or email. You can also experiment with different database configurations and see how the DAO pattern simplifies the process of switching between data sources.
