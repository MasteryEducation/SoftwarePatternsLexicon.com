## 10.3 Repository Pattern

The Repository Pattern is a crucial design pattern in software development, particularly when dealing with data access and persistence. It acts as a mediator between the domain and data mapping layers, providing a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. This pattern is especially beneficial in PHP applications, where it helps maintain a clean separation between business logic and data access code.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Repository Pattern is to abstract the data access layer, allowing the domain logic to remain agnostic of the underlying data source. This separation of concerns enhances the maintainability, scalability, and testability of the application.

### Key Participants

- **Repository Interface:** Defines the contract for data access operations.
- **Concrete Repository:** Implements the repository interface, handling the actual data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Domain Model:** Represents the business logic and entities of the application.
- **Data Source:** The underlying database or external data source.

### Applicability

The Repository Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You need to separate domain logic from data access logic.
- The application requires a flexible data access layer that can be easily swapped or mocked.
- You want to enhance testability by isolating the domain logic from the data source.

### Implementing Repository in PHP

Let's dive into the implementation of the Repository Pattern in PHP. We'll create a simple application that manages a collection of `Product` entities. Our goal is to separate the domain logic from the data access logic using the Repository Pattern.

#### Step 1: Define the Domain Model

First, we define the `Product` class, which represents the domain model.

```php
<?php

class Product
{
    private int $id;
    private string $name;
    private float $price;

    public function __construct(int $id, string $name, float $price)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->price = $price;
    }

    public function getId(): int
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function getPrice(): float
    {
        return $this->price;
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Repository Interface

Next, we define the `ProductRepositoryInterface`, which outlines the contract for data access operations.

```php
<?php

interface ProductRepositoryInterface
{
    public function findById(int $id): ?Product;
    public function findAll(): array;
    public function save(Product $product): void;
    public function delete(Product $product): void;
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Concrete Repository

Now, we implement the `ProductRepositoryInterface` in a concrete class, `ProductRepository`. This class will handle the actual data retrieval and manipulation.

```php
<?php

class ProductRepository implements ProductRepositoryInterface
{
    private array $products = [];

    public function findById(int $id): ?Product
    {
        foreach ($this->products as $product) {
            if ($product->getId() === $id) {
                return $product;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public function findAll(): array
    {
        return $this->products;
    }

    public function save(Product $product): void
    {
        $this->products[$product->getId()] = $product;
    }

    public function delete(Product $product): void
    {
        unset($this->products[$product->getId()]);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Using the Repository

With the repository in place, we can now use it to manage `Product` entities without worrying about the underlying data source.

```php
<?php

$productRepository = new ProductRepository();

// Create and save a new product
$product = new Product(1, "Laptop", 999.99);
$productRepository->save($product);

// Retrieve a product by ID
$retrievedProduct = $productRepository->findById(1);
echo $retrievedProduct->getName(); // Output: Laptop

// Delete a product
$productRepository->delete($product);
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Repository Pattern, consider the following:

- **Consistency:** Ensure that the repository interface provides a consistent and meaningful set of operations.
- **Performance:** Be mindful of performance implications, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Flexibility:** Design the repository to be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the data source or domain model.

### PHP Unique Features

PHP offers several unique features that can enhance the implementation of the Repository Pattern:

- **Type Declarations:** Use PHP's type declarations to enforce type safety in repository interfaces and implementations.
- **Anonymous Classes:** Leverage anonymous classes for quick prototyping or testing of repository implementations.
- **Traits:** Use traits to share common functionality across multiple repository implementations.

### Differences and Similarities

The Repository Pattern is often confused with the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. While both patterns abstract data access, the Repository Pattern focuses on domain logic, whereas the DAO pattern is more concerned with the persistence mechanism.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Repository Pattern is widely used in PHP applications, particularly those that require a clean separation between domain logic and data access. Here are some common use cases:

- **Enhancing Testability:** By abstracting the data access layer, repositories can be easily mocked or stubbed in unit tests.
- **Supporting Multiple Data Sources:** Repositories can be designed to support multiple data sources, such as databases, APIs, or file systems.
- **Facilitating Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The Repository Pattern aligns well with DDD principles, promoting a clear separation between domain and infrastructure concerns.

### Visualizing the Repository Pattern

To better understand the Repository Pattern, let's visualize its components and interactions using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Product {
        +int id
        +string name
        +float price
        +getId()
        +getName()
        +getPrice()
    }

    class ProductRepositoryInterface {
        <<interface>>
        +findById(int id) Product
        +findAll() array
        +save(Product product) void
        +delete(Product product) void
    }

    class ProductRepository {
        +findById(int id) Product
        +findAll() array
        +save(Product product) void
        +delete(Product product) void
    }

    ProductRepositoryInterface <|.. ProductRepository
    ProductRepository --> Product
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of the Repository Pattern, it's time to experiment with the code. Try modifying the `ProductRepository` to use a different data storage mechanism, such as a database or an external API. This exercise will help reinforce your understanding of the pattern and its flexibility.
