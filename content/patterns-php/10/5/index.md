## 10.5 Query Builder Pattern

### Intent

The Query Builder Pattern provides a programmatic way to construct database queries. It abstracts the complexity of SQL syntax, allowing developers to build queries using a fluent API. This pattern enhances code readability, maintainability, and security by preventing SQL injection attacks.

### Introduction to Query Builder Pattern

In modern PHP applications, interacting with databases is a common requirement. While raw SQL queries offer flexibility, they can be error-prone and challenging to maintain. The Query Builder Pattern addresses these issues by providing a structured way to build queries programmatically.

### Implementing Query Builder in PHP

#### Method Chaining and Fluent Interfaces

The Query Builder Pattern often employs method chaining and fluent interfaces to construct queries. This approach allows developers to chain method calls in a readable and intuitive manner.

**Example:**

```php
$query = (new QueryBuilder())
    ->select('name', 'email')
    ->from('users')
    ->where('status', '=', 'active')
    ->orderBy('created_at', 'DESC')
    ->limit(10);
```

In this example, each method call returns the QueryBuilder instance, enabling a chain of calls that build the query step by step.

#### Key Components of a Query Builder

1. **Select**: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
2. **From**: Defines the table to query.
3. **Where**: Adds conditions to filter results.
4. **Order By**: Sorts the results.
5. **Limit**: Restricts the number of results.

### Framework Examples

#### Doctrine QueryBuilder

Doctrine's QueryBuilder is a powerful tool for building complex SQL queries. It supports a wide range of SQL operations and integrates seamlessly with Doctrine ORM.

**Link:** [Doctrine QueryBuilder](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/query-builder.html)

**Example:**

```php
use Doctrine\DBAL\Query\QueryBuilder;

$queryBuilder = new QueryBuilder($connection);
$queryBuilder
    ->select('u.name', 'u.email')
    ->from('users', 'u')
    ->where('u.status = :status')
    ->setParameter(':status', 'active')
    ->orderBy('u.created_at', 'DESC')
    ->setMaxResults(10);

$sql = $queryBuilder->getSQL();
```

#### Laravel Query Builder

Laravel's Query Builder provides a fluent interface for building database queries. It supports a wide range of database operations and is highly expressive.

**Link:** [Laravel Query Builder](https://laravel.com/docs/queries)

**Example:**

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
    ->select('name', 'email')
    ->where('status', 'active')
    ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
    ->limit(10)
    ->get();
```

### Design Considerations

#### When to Use the Query Builder Pattern

- **Complex Queries**: When building complex queries with multiple conditions and joins.
- **Dynamic Queries**: When query conditions are determined at runtime.
- **Readability**: When improving code readability and maintainability is a priority.
- **Security**: To prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.

#### Important Considerations

- **Performance**: While query builders enhance readability, they may introduce a slight performance overhead compared to raw SQL.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn the specific API of the query builder being used.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure the query builder supports the database features required by your application.

### PHP Unique Features

PHP's dynamic nature and extensive library support make it an ideal language for implementing the Query Builder Pattern. Features like anonymous functions and closures can be leveraged to create powerful and flexible query builders.

### Differences and Similarities

The Query Builder Pattern is often compared to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) patterns. While both abstract database interactions, query builders focus on constructing SQL queries, whereas ORMs map database tables to objects.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code example by modifying the query conditions and observing the generated SQL:

```php
$query = (new QueryBuilder())
    ->select('id', 'username')
    ->from('accounts')
    ->where('active', '=', true)
    ->orderBy('last_login', 'ASC')
    ->limit(5);

echo $query->getSQL();
```

### Visualizing the Query Builder Pattern

```mermaid

    class QueryBuilder {
        +select(columns)
        +from(table)
        +where(condition)
        +orderBy(column, direction)
        +limit(count)
        +getSQL()
    }
    QueryBuilder : +string select
    QueryBuilder : +string from
    QueryBuilder : +string where
    QueryBuilder : +string orderBy
    QueryBuilder : +string limit
    QueryBuilder : +string getSQL
```
