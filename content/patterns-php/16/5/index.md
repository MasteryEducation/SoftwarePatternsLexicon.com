## 16.5 Password Hashing and Storage

In today's digital age, securing user credentials is paramount. Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access, and their protection is critical to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user data. In this section, we will delve into the best practices for password hashing and storage in PHP, focusing on modern techniques and tools that ensure robust security.

### Understanding Password Hashing

Password hashing is a one-way cryptographic operation that transforms a password into a fixed-length string of characters, which is not meant to be reversed. Unlike encryption, which is reversible, hashing is designed to be a one-way function, making it ideal for storing passwords securely.

#### Why Hash Passwords?

- **Security**: Hashing ensures that even if a database is compromised, the actual passwords remain protected.
- **Irreversibility**: A good hash function makes it computationally infeasible to retrieve the original password from the hash.
- **Uniqueness**: Even small changes in the input (password) produce significantly different hashes.

### Best Practices for Passwords

1. **Never Store Passwords in Plain Text**: Storing passwords in plain text is a critical security flaw. If your database is breached, attackers will have direct access to user credentials.

2. **Use Strong, Adaptive Hashing Algorithms**: Algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, and PBKDF2 are designed to be computationally intensive, making brute-force attacks more difficult.

3. **Implement Salting**: A salt is a random value added to the password before hashing. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different.

4. **Regularly Update Hashing Algorithms**: As computational power increases, older algorithms may become vulnerable. Regularly review and update the hashing algorithms used in your application.

### Using `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`

PHP provides built-in functions for password hashing and verification, making it easier to implement secure password storage.

#### `password_hash()`

The `password_hash()` function in PHP automatically uses strong algorithms and generates salts. It is designed to be simple and secure, abstracting the complexities of hashing from the developer.

```php
<?php
// Hash a password using the default algorithm (bcrypt)
$password = 'user_password';
$hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

// Output the hashed password
echo $hashedPassword;
?>
```

- **Automatic Salting**: `password_hash()` automatically generates a salt, ensuring that each hash is unique.
- **Algorithm Options**: You can specify the algorithm to use, such as `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` or `PASSWORD_ARGON2I`.

#### `password_verify()`

The `password_verify()` function is used to validate a password against a hashed value. It compares the input password with the stored hash and returns `true` if they match.

```php
<?php
// Verify a password against a hash
$inputPassword = 'user_password';
$isPasswordValid = password_verify($inputPassword, $hashedPassword);

if ($isPasswordValid) {
    echo 'Password is valid!';
} else {
    echo 'Invalid password.';
}
?>
```

- **Secure Comparison**: `password_verify()` uses a constant-time algorithm to prevent timing attacks.

### Password Policies

Implementing strong password policies is crucial for enhancing security. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Enforce Strong Password Requirements**: Require users to create passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

2. **Implement Rate Limiting on Login Attempts**: Protect against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts from a single IP address.

3. **Encourage Regular Password Changes**: Prompt users to change their passwords periodically to mitigate the risk of compromised credentials.

### Advanced Techniques for Password Security

#### Argon2: The Modern Hashing Algorithm

Argon2 is a memory-hard hashing algorithm that won the Password Hashing Competition in 2015. It is designed to resist both GPU and ASIC attacks, making it a robust choice for password hashing.

```php
<?php
// Hash a password using Argon2
$hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_ARGON2I);

// Verify the password
$isPasswordValid = password_verify($inputPassword, $hashedPassword);
?>
```

- **Memory-Hardness**: Argon2 requires a significant amount of memory to compute, making it resistant to parallel attacks.

#### Using PBKDF2

PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is another secure hashing algorithm that uses a pseudorandom function and applies it iteratively.

```php
<?php
// Hash a password using PBKDF2
$iterations = 10000;
$salt = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(16);
$hashedPassword = hash_pbkdf2('sha256', $password, $salt, $iterations, 64);
?>
```

- **Customizable Iterations**: The number of iterations can be adjusted to increase the computational cost of hashing.

### Visualizing Password Hashing Process

To better understand the password hashing process, let's visualize it using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Password] --> B[Add Salt];
    B --> C[Hash with Algorithm];
    C --> D[Store Hash in Database];
    E[User Login] --> F[Input Password];
    F --> G[Retrieve Stored Hash];
    G --> H[Verify with password_verify()];
    H --> I{Match?};
    I -->|Yes| J[Grant Access];
    I -->|No| K[Deny Access];
```

**Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of hashing a password and verifying it during user login. The password is first salted and hashed before being stored in the database. During login, the input password is verified against the stored hash.
