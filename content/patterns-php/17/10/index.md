## 17.10 Code Coverage and Static Analysis

In the realm of PHP development, ensuring that your code is both robust and maintainable is paramount. Two critical components in achieving this are **code coverage** and **static analysis**. These tools and techniques help developers identify potential issues early, enforce coding standards, and ultimately deliver high-quality software.

### Understanding Code Coverage

**Code coverage** is a metric used to measure the amount of code executed during automated tests. It provides insights into which parts of your codebase are being tested and which are not, helping you identify untested paths and improve your test suite.

#### Types of Code Coverage

1. **Line Coverage:** Measures the percentage of lines executed.
2. **Function Coverage:** Determines which functions have been called.
3. **Branch Coverage:** Evaluates whether each branch of control structures (like `if` statements) has been executed.
4. **Path Coverage:** Considers all possible paths through the code.

### Generating Code Coverage Reports

To generate code coverage reports in PHP, we commonly use **PHPUnit** in conjunction with extensions like **Xdebug** or **pcov**.

#### Setting Up PHPUnit with Xdebug

1. **Install Xdebug:** Ensure Xdebug is installed and configured in your `php.ini` file.
2. **Configure PHPUnit:** Add the following configuration to your `phpunit.xml`:

   ```xml
   <phpunit>
       <coverage processUncoveredFiles="true">
           <report>
               <clover outputFile="build/logs/clover.xml"/>
               <html outputDirectory="build/coverage"/>
           </report>
       </coverage>
   </phpunit>
   ```

3. **Run Tests with Coverage:** Execute your tests with coverage enabled:

   ```bash
   phpunit --coverage-html build/coverage
   ```

#### Using pcov for Code Coverage

**pcov** is an alternative to Xdebug, optimized for code coverage. It is lightweight and faster, making it suitable for CI environments.

1. **Install pcov:** Use PECL to install pcov:

   ```bash
   pecl install pcov
   ```

2. **Enable pcov:** Add the following to your `php.ini`:

   ```ini
   extension=pcov.so
   pcov.enabled=1
   ```

3. **Run PHPUnit with pcov:** Ensure pcov is enabled when running PHPUnit:

   ```bash
   phpunit --coverage-html build/coverage
   ```

### Interpreting Code Coverage Reports

Once you have generated a code coverage report, you can analyze it to identify areas of your code that lack test coverage. Focus on increasing coverage for critical parts of your application, such as business logic and complex algorithms.

### Static Analysis in PHP

**Static analysis** involves examining your code without executing it to find potential errors, enforce coding standards, and ensure code quality. It helps catch issues early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of bugs in production.

#### Popular Static Analysis Tools

1. **PHPStan:** A powerful static analysis tool that helps you find bugs in your code without running it. It focuses on type safety and can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.

   - **Installation:**

     ```bash
     composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
     ```

   - **Configuration:**

     Create a `phpstan.neon` file to configure PHPStan:

     ```yaml
     parameters:
         level: max
         paths:
             - src
             - tests
     ```

   - **Running PHPStan:**

     ```bash
     vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
     ```

   - **Link:** [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)

2. **Psalm:** Another static analysis tool that focuses on finding errors and improving code quality. It offers features like type inference and can be customized to suit your project's needs.

   - **Installation:**

     ```bash
     composer require --dev vimeo/psalm
     ```

   - **Configuration:**

     Initialize Psalm with:

     ```bash
     vendor/bin/psalm --init
     ```

   - **Running Psalm:**

     ```bash
     vendor/bin/psalm
     ```

   - **Link:** [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/)

### Benefits of Code Coverage and Static Analysis

- **Early Detection of Issues:** Identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities before they reach production.
- **Enforcement of Coding Standards:** Ensure consistency and maintainability across your codebase.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Enhance the reliability and robustness of your software.
- **Increased Confidence:** Gain assurance that your code behaves as expected.

### Visualizing Code Coverage and Static Analysis

To better understand the flow of code coverage and static analysis, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.
