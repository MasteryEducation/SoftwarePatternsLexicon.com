## 17.3 Mocking and Test Doubles

In the realm of software testing, particularly in PHP, the concepts of mocking and test doubles play a crucial role in ensuring that our code is reliable, maintainable, and robust. This section will delve into the intricacies of mocking, explore various types of test doubles, demonstrate how to use PHPUnit for creating mock objects, and emphasize the importance of isolation in tests.

### Concept of Mocking

Mocking is a technique used in unit testing to simulate the behavior of real objects. It allows developers to test a unit of code in isolation by replacing its dependencies with mock objects that mimic the behavior of the real ones. This is particularly useful when the real objects are complex, slow, or have side effects that are undesirable during testing.

#### Why Mocking?

- **Isolation**: By mocking dependencies, we can focus on testing the unit of code without interference from external factors.
- **Speed**: Mock objects are typically faster than real objects, especially if the real objects involve network calls or database access.
- **Control**: Mocks allow us to simulate different scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions, which might be difficult to reproduce with real objects.
- **Independence**: Tests can be run independently of the environment, making them more reliable and easier to automate.

### Types of Test Doubles

Test doubles are objects that stand in for real objects in a test. They come in various forms, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Mocks**: These are objects pre-programmed with expectations, which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. Mocks are used to verify that the interactions with the object are as expected.

2. **Stubs**: These provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. Stubs are used to simulate the behavior of real objects.

3. **Spies**: These are similar to mocks but are used to record information about how they were called, such as the number of times a method was invoked.

4. **Fakes**: These are objects with working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (e.g., an in-memory database).

5. **Dummies**: These are objects that are passed around but never actually used. They are usually just used to fill parameter lists.

### Using PHPUnit Mock Objects

PHPUnit is a popular testing framework in PHP that provides robust support for creating mock objects. Let's explore how to create and use mock objects with PHPUnit.

#### Creating Mocks with `createMock()`

The `createMock()` method is the simplest way to create a mock object in PHPUnit. It creates a mock object for a specified class or interface.

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class UserServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testUserCreation()
    {
        // Create a mock for the UserRepository class
        $userRepositoryMock = $this->createMock(UserRepository::class);

        // Configure the mock to return a specific value when the find method is called
        $userRepositoryMock->method('find')
                           ->willReturn(new User('John Doe'));

        // Inject the mock into the UserService
        $userService = new UserService($userRepositoryMock);

        // Assert that the user creation process works as expected
        $this->assertEquals('John Doe', $userService->createUser()->getName());
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a mock for the `UserRepository` class and configure it to return a specific `User` object when the `find` method is called. This allows us to test the `UserService` class in isolation.

#### Creating Mocks with `getMockBuilder()`

For more complex mocking scenarios, you can use the `getMockBuilder()` method. This provides more control over the mock object, allowing you to set expectations, configure methods, and more.

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class OrderServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testOrderProcessing()
    {
        // Create a mock for the PaymentGateway class
        $paymentGatewayMock = $this->getMockBuilder(PaymentGateway::class)
                                   ->setMethods(['charge'])
                                   ->getMock();

        // Set up the expectation for the charge method
        $paymentGatewayMock->expects($this->once())
                           ->method('charge')
                           ->with($this->equalTo(100))
                           ->willReturn(true);

        // Inject the mock into the OrderService
        $orderService = new OrderService($paymentGatewayMock);

        // Assert that the order processing works as expected
        $this->assertTrue($orderService->processOrder(100));
    }
}
```

Here, we use `getMockBuilder()` to create a mock for the `PaymentGateway` class and set an expectation that the `charge` method will be called once with a specific argument.

### Isolation in Tests

Isolation is a fundamental principle in unit testing. By isolating the unit under test from its dependencies, we can ensure that our tests are reliable and focused solely on the behavior of the unit.

#### Mocking External Dependencies

Mocking is a powerful tool for achieving isolation in tests. By replacing external dependencies with mock objects, we can:

- **Eliminate Side Effects**: Avoid unintended consequences that might arise from interacting with real dependencies.
- **Simulate Edge Cases**: Easily create scenarios that might be difficult to reproduce with real dependencies.
- **Improve Test Speed**: Reduce the time it takes to run tests by avoiding slow operations, such as network calls or database queries.

### Visualizing Mocking and Test Doubles

To better understand the relationship between the different types of test doubles and their roles in testing, let's visualize them using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TestDouble {
        <<interface>>
        +void act()
    }
    class Mock {
        +void act()
        +void verify()
    }
    class Stub {
        +void act()
        +void returnValue()
    }
    class Spy {
        +void act()
        +void recordCall()
    }
    class Fake {
        +void act()
        +void shortcut()
    }
    class Dummy {
        +void act()
    }

    TestDouble <|-- Mock
    TestDouble <|-- Stub
    TestDouble <|-- Spy
    TestDouble <|-- Fake
    TestDouble <|-- Dummy
```

This diagram illustrates the hierarchy of test doubles, with each type implementing the `TestDouble` interface and providing specific functionality for testing.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of mocking and test doubles, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Experiment with Different Return Values**: Change the return values of the mock methods to see how it affects the test outcomes.
- **Add More Expectations**: Use `expects()` to set additional expectations on the mock objects and observe how they influence the tests.
- **Create Your Own Test Doubles**: Implement custom test doubles for a class in your project and use them in your tests.
