## 17.13 Using Code Quality Tools (PHPStan, Psalm)

In the world of PHP development, maintaining high code quality is crucial for building robust, maintainable, and error-free applications. Static analysis tools like PHPStan and Psalm have become indispensable in achieving this goal. These tools help developers identify potential issues in their code without executing it, thus saving time and reducing the risk of bugs in production.

### Static Analysis Benefits

Static analysis tools offer several advantages:

- **Early Bug Detection**: Identify potential issues before they manifest as runtime errors.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Enforce coding standards and best practices.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Simplify code reviews by automatically catching common mistakes.
- **Increased Developer Productivity**: Reduce the time spent on debugging and testing.

### PHPStan Features

PHPStan is a popular static analysis tool for PHP that focuses on finding bugs in your code. It offers a level-based analysis system, allowing you to progressively improve your codebase.

#### Key Features of PHPStan

- **Level-Based Analysis**: PHPStan uses a level system (0-8) to gradually increase the strictness of analysis. Start at a lower level and work your way up as your code improves.
- **Type Safety**: Enforces type safety by checking for type-related errors.
- **Custom Rules**: Extend PHPStan with custom rules to enforce project-specific standards.
- **IDE Integration**: Integrates with popular IDEs for real-time feedback.

#### Installing PHPStan

To get started with PHPStan, you need to install it via Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
```

#### Configuring PHPStan

Create a `phpstan.neon` configuration file to customize PHPStan's behavior:

```yaml
parameters:
    level: 5
    paths:
        - src
    autoload_files:
        - %rootDir%/../../vendor/autoload.php
```

#### Running PHPStan

Run PHPStan from the command line to analyze your code:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

### Psalm Features

Psalm is another powerful static analysis tool for PHP, known for its advanced type inference capabilities and comprehensive static analysis.

#### Key Features of Psalm

- **Type Inference**: Automatically infers types, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
- **Advanced Static Analysis**: Detects a wide range of issues, including unused code and potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Plugin System**: Extend Psalm's functionality with plugins.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Easily integrate Psalm into your CI/CD pipelines.

#### Installing Psalm

Install Psalm using Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev vimeo/psalm
```

#### Configuring Psalm

Create a `psalm.xml` configuration file to define your project's analysis settings:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<psalm>
    <projectFiles>
        <directory name="src" />
    </projectFiles>
    <issueHandlers>
        <MissingReturnType errorLevel="info" />
    </issueHandlers>
</psalm>
```

#### Running Psalm

Execute Psalm to analyze your codebase:

```bash
vendor/bin/psalm
```

### Integration with CI

Integrating PHPStan and Psalm into your Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines ensures that code quality checks are automated and enforced consistently across your team.

#### Setting Up CI Integration

1. **Choose a CI Service**: Select a CI service like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Travis CI.
2. **Configure CI Pipeline**: Add steps to your CI configuration to run PHPStan and Psalm.
3. **Fail on Errors**: Configure the pipeline to fail if either tool detects issues.

#### Example: GitHub Actions

Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that runs PHPStan and Psalm:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  static-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.0'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: composer install
      - name: Run PHPStan
        run: vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
      - name: Run Psalm
        run: vendor/bin/psalm
```

### Code Examples

Let's explore some code examples to see how PHPStan and Psalm can help improve code quality.

#### Example 1: Detecting Type Errors

Consider the following PHP code:

```php
function add(int $a, int $b): int {
    return $a + $b;
}

echo add(5, '10'); // This will cause a type error
```

Running PHPStan or Psalm on this code will flag the type mismatch, helping you catch the error before runtime.

#### Example 2: Identifying Unused Code

Static analysis tools can also identify unused code, which can clutter your codebase and lead to maintenance challenges.

```php
function unusedFunction() {
    return "This function is never called";
}
```

Both PHPStan and Psalm will alert you to the presence of unused functions, encouraging you to clean up your code.

### Visualizing Static Analysis Workflow

To better understand how static analysis tools fit into the development workflow, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Write Code] --> B[Run Static Analysis]
    B --> C{Issues Found?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Fix Issues]
    C -->|No| E[Proceed to Testing]
    D --> B
    E --> F[Deploy Code]
```

**Description**: This flowchart illustrates the integration of static analysis tools into the development workflow. After writing code, developers run static analysis to identify issues. If issues are found, they are fixed, and the analysis is rerun. Once the code passes static analysis, it proceeds to testing and deployment.
