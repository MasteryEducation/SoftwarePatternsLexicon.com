## 20.10 Handling and Reporting Errors in Production

In the world of PHP development, handling and reporting errors effectively in a production environment is crucial for maintaining application stability and ensuring a seamless user experience. This section will guide you through the best practices, configurations, and tools necessary to manage errors in production efficiently.

### Understanding Error Handling in PHP

Before diving into production-specific strategies, let's briefly revisit how PHP handles errors. PHP provides several mechanisms for error handling, including error reporting levels, custom error handlers, and exception handling. Understanding these concepts is essential for configuring error handling in production.

#### Error Reporting Levels

PHP allows you to define the types of errors that should be reported using the `error_reporting()` function or the `error_reporting` directive in the `php.ini` file. Common error levels include:

- **E_ERROR**: Fatal run-time errors.
- **E_WARNING**: Run-time warnings (non-fatal errors).
- **E_NOTICE**: Run-time notices (minor issues).
- **E_ALL**: All errors and warnings.

In a production environment, it's crucial to suppress detailed error messages to prevent sensitive information from being exposed to users.

```php
// Suppress detailed error messages in production
error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE);
ini_set('display_errors', 0);
```

### Configuring Error Handling for Production

#### Suppressing Detailed Errors

In production, you should suppress detailed error messages and instead log them for developers to review. This prevents sensitive information from being exposed to end-users and ensures a professional user experience.

```php
// Configure error reporting for production
ini_set('display_errors', '0');
ini_set('log_errors', '1');
ini_set('error_log', '/path/to/error.log');
```

#### User-Friendly Error Pages

When errors occur, it's important to provide users with friendly error pages rather than exposing raw error messages. Custom error pages for common HTTP errors like 404 (Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) can enhance user experience.

```php
// Example of a custom error page for HTTP 500 errors
header("HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error");
include('500.html');
exit();
```

### Leveraging Error Reporting Services

To streamline error tracking and reporting, consider integrating third-party error reporting services. These tools provide real-time error monitoring, alerting, and detailed error reports.

#### Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is a popular error tracking tool that provides real-time error monitoring and alerting. It captures errors and exceptions, aggregates them, and provides insights into their frequency and impact.

```php
// Example of integrating Sentry with PHP
\Sentry\init(['dsn' => 'https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0']);

try {
    // Your code here
} catch (Exception $e) {
    \Sentry\captureException($e);
}
```

#### Bugsnag

[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) is another robust error monitoring tool that provides automatic error detection, alerting, and detailed error reports. It supports various platforms, including PHP.

```php
// Example of integrating Bugsnag with PHP
$bugsnag = Bugsnag\Client::make('your-api-key');
Bugsnag\Handler::register($bugsnag);

try {
    // Your code here
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $bugsnag->notifyException($e);
}
```

### Best Practices for Error Handling in Production

#### Secure Error Logging

Ensure that error logs are stored securely and accessible only to authorized personnel. Use file permissions and access controls to protect log files.

#### Alerting Developers

Set up alerts for critical errors to notify developers promptly. This can be achieved through email notifications, Slack integrations, or other communication channels.

#### Regular Log Review

Regularly review error logs to identify recurring issues and address them proactively. This helps in maintaining application stability and improving user experience.

### Visualizing Error Handling Workflow

To better understand the error handling workflow in production, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Error Occurs] --> B{Is Error Critical?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Log Error];
    C --> D[Notify Developers];
    B -- No --> E[Log Error];
    E --> F[Display User-Friendly Error Page];
    D --> F;
```

**Diagram Description:** This flowchart illustrates the error handling workflow in production. When an error occurs, it is logged, and developers are notified if it's critical. A user-friendly error page is displayed to the user.

### Try It Yourself
