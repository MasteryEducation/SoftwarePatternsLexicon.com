## 23.2 Case Study: Building an eCommerce Platform

In this case study, we will explore how to build a robust and scalable eCommerce platform using PHP design patterns. By leveraging patterns such as MVC, Factory Method, Strategy, Observer, and Decorator, we can create a modular system that efficiently handles product catalogs, user carts, orders, and payments. This approach not only enhances maintainability but also facilitates future growth and feature additions.

### Challenges in Building an eCommerce Platform

Building an eCommerce platform involves several challenges, including:

- **Handling Product Catalogs:** Efficiently managing a large number of products with varying attributes.
- **User Carts and Orders:** Ensuring seamless user experience from adding products to the cart to placing orders.
- **Payment Processing:** Supporting multiple payment gateways securely and reliably.
- **Stock Management:** Keeping track of inventory levels and updating them in real-time.
- **Promotional Features:** Implementing discounts, offers, and other promotional strategies.

### Patterns Implemented

To address these challenges, we will implement the following design patterns:

1. **MVC Pattern:** For structuring the application and separating concerns.
2. **Factory Method:** For creating product objects dynamically based on their type.
3. **Strategy Pattern:** For implementing multiple payment gateways.
4. **Observer Pattern:** For updating stock levels and notifying users.
5. **Decorator Pattern:** For adding promotional features to products.

Let's dive into each pattern and see how they contribute to building our eCommerce platform.

### MVC Pattern: Structuring the Application

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is fundamental in structuring our eCommerce application. It separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the presentation layer.
- **Controller:** Acts as an interface between Model and View, processing user input.

#### Implementing MVC in PHP

```php
// Model: Product.php
class Product {
    private $id;
    private $name;
    private $price;
    private $stock;

    public function __construct($id, $name, $price, $stock) {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->price = $price;
        $this->stock = $stock;
    }

    // Getters and setters...
}

// View: productView.php
function displayProduct($product) {
    echo "<h1>{$product->getName()}</h1>";
    echo "<p>Price: {$product->getPrice()}</p>";
    echo "<p>Stock: {$product->getStock()}</p>";
}

// Controller: ProductController.php
class ProductController {
    private $model;
    private $view;

    public function __construct($model, $view) {
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->view = $view;
    }

    public function showProduct() {
        $this->view->displayProduct($this->model);
    }
}

// Usage
$product = new Product(1, "Laptop", 999.99, 10);
$view = new ProductView();
$controller = new ProductController($product, $view);
$controller->showProduct();
```

### Factory Method: Creating Product Objects Dynamically

The Factory Method pattern allows us to create product objects dynamically based on their type. This is particularly useful when dealing with a diverse product catalog.

#### Implementing Factory Method in PHP

```php
// ProductFactory.php
abstract class ProductFactory {
    abstract public function createProduct($type);
}

class ConcreteProductFactory extends ProductFactory {
    public function createProduct($type) {
        switch ($type) {
            case 'Electronics':
                return new ElectronicsProduct();
            case 'Clothing':
                return new ClothingProduct();
            default:
                throw new Exception("Invalid product type");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
$factory = new ConcreteProductFactory();
$product = $factory->createProduct('Electronics');
```

### Strategy Pattern: Implementing Multiple Payment Gateways

The Strategy pattern is ideal for implementing multiple payment gateways. It allows us to define a family of algorithms (payment methods) and make them interchangeable.

#### Implementing Strategy Pattern in PHP

```php
// PaymentStrategy.php
interface PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay($amount);
}

class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay($amount) {
        echo "Paying $amount using PayPal.";
    }
}

class CreditCardStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay($amount) {
        echo "Paying $amount using Credit Card.";
    }
}

// Usage
$paymentMethod = new PayPalStrategy();
$paymentMethod->pay(100);
```

### Observer Pattern: Updating Stock Levels and Notifying Users

The Observer pattern helps in updating stock levels and notifying users about changes. It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

#### Implementing Observer Pattern in PHP

```php
// Observer.php
interface Observer {
    public function update($product);
}

class StockObserver implements Observer {
    public function update($product) {
        echo "Stock updated for product: {$product->getName()}";
    }
}

// Subject.php
interface Subject {
    public function attach(Observer $observer);
    public function detach(Observer $observer);
    public function notify();
}

class Product implements Subject {
    private $observers = [];

    public function attach(Observer $observer) {
        $this->observers[] = $observer;
    }

    public function detach(Observer $observer) {
        $key = array_search($observer, $this->observers);
        if ($key !== false) {
            unset($this->observers[$key]);
        }
    }

    public function notify() {
        foreach ($this->observers as $observer) {
            $observer->update($this);
        }
    }

    // Other methods...
}

// Usage
$product = new Product();
$stockObserver = new StockObserver();
$product->attach($stockObserver);
$product->notify();
```

### Decorator Pattern: Adding Promotional Features to Products

The Decorator pattern allows us to add new functionality to existing objects without altering their structure. This is useful for adding promotional features to products.

#### Implementing Decorator Pattern in PHP

```php
// ProductDecorator.php
abstract class ProductDecorator extends Product {
    protected $product;

    public function __construct(Product $product) {
        $this->product = $product;
    }
}

class DiscountDecorator extends ProductDecorator {
    private $discount;

    public function __construct(Product $product, $discount) {
        parent::__construct($product);
        $this->discount = $discount;
    }

    public function getPrice() {
        return $this->product->getPrice() - $this->discount;
    }
}

// Usage
$product = new Product(1, "Laptop", 999.99, 10);
$discountedProduct = new DiscountDecorator($product, 100);
echo $discountedProduct->getPrice(); // Outputs: 899.99
```

### Outcome: A Modular, Scalable Platform

By integrating these design patterns, we have built a modular and scalable eCommerce platform. The use of MVC ensures a clean separation of concerns, while the Factory Method and Strategy patterns provide flexibility in product creation and payment processing. The Observer pattern keeps our stock levels updated, and the Decorator pattern allows for easy addition of promotional features.
