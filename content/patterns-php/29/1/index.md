## 29.1 Glossary of Terms

In this section, we provide a comprehensive glossary of key terms and acronyms used throughout the guide. This glossary serves as a quick reference to clarify concepts and enhance your understanding of PHP design patterns and related topics.

### A

**Abstract Factory Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows for the creation of objects that follow a general pattern.

**Abstraction**  
A fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

**Adapter Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

**Agile Development**  
A methodology for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement.

### B

**Behavioral Patterns**  
Design patterns that focus on communication between objects, how they interact, and how responsibilities are distributed among them. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

**Builder Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### C

**Chain of Responsibility Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled. It decouples the sender of a request from its receiver.

**Class**  
A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It defines a set of properties and methods that the created objects will have.

**Closure**  
A feature in PHP that allows the creation of anonymous functions that can capture variables from the surrounding scope. Closures are often used for callback functions.

**Command Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Composite Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**Creational Patterns**  
Design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, and Builder patterns.

### D

**Data Mapper Pattern**  
A structural pattern that separates the in-memory objects from the database. It moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself.

**Decorator Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

**Dependency Injection**  
A design pattern used to implement IoC, allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class through different ways. It helps in making the code more flexible and easier to test.

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
An approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

### E

**Encapsulation**  
A principle of object-oriented programming that restricts access to certain components of an object and can prevent the accidental modification of data. It is achieved by using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.

**Event Sourcing**  
A pattern in which changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events. It ensures that all changes to the application state are stored as a sequence of events, which can be replayed to reconstruct past states.

**Exception Handling**  
A mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing the program to continue its execution or terminate gracefully. PHP provides try, catch, and finally blocks for exception handling.

### F

**Facade Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

**Factory Method Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Fluent Interface Pattern**  
A design pattern that provides an easily readable and flowing interface by using method chaining. It is often used in query builders and configuration APIs.

**Flyweight Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows for the sharing of objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. It reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

### G

Refers to the authors of the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," which introduced 23 classic design patterns. The authors are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

**GraphQL**  
A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST.

### H

**Hexagonal Architecture**  
Also known as Ports and Adapters, it is an architectural pattern used to create loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment.

**HATEOAS**  
Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, a constraint of the REST application architecture that keeps the RESTful style unique. It allows clients to dynamically navigate to related resources by following hyperlinks in the responses.

### I

**Inheritance**  
A mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a subtype from an existing object.

**Interface**  
A contract in object-oriented programming that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It provides a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.

**Inversion of Control (IoC)**  
A design principle in which the control of object creation and management is transferred from the application code to a container or framework. It is often implemented through dependency injection.

**Iterator Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for transmitting data in web applications.

### K

**KISS Principle**  
"Keep It Simple, Stupid" is a design principle that states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Simplicity should be a key goal in design.

### L

**Lazy Initialization**  
A design pattern that delays the initialization of an object until it is needed. It can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations and memory usage.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**  
A principle in object-oriented programming that states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### M

**Magic Methods**  
Special methods in PHP that allow you to perform operations on objects in a more dynamic way. Examples include `__construct()`, `__destruct()`, `__call()`, and `__get()`.

**Mediator Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

**Microservices Architecture**  
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. It enables continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex applications.

**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**  
An architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

**Multiton Pattern**  
A design pattern that ensures a class has only a limited number of instances and provides a global point of access to them. It is a variation of the Singleton pattern.

### N

**Namespace**  
A way of encapsulating items so that they can be grouped together and avoid name collisions. PHP namespaces provide a way to group related classes, interfaces, functions, and constants.

**Null Object Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that uses an object with defined neutral (null) behavior to represent the absence of an object. It can simplify the code by eliminating the need for null checks.

### O

**Observer Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Open/Closed Principle**  
A principle in object-oriented programming that states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. It encourages the design of software that can be extended without changing existing code.

**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**  
A programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm.

### P

**Polymorphism**  
A principle in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

**Prototype Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that allows cloning of objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes. It involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

**Proxy Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object. It acts as an intermediary, controlling access to the original object.

### Q

**Query Builder Pattern**  
A design pattern that provides an easy-to-use, programmatic interface for building SQL queries. It abstracts the complexity of raw SQL queries and provides a fluent interface for query construction.

### R

**Reactive Programming**  
A programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. It allows for the creation of responsive and resilient applications.

**Repository Pattern**  
A design pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. It provides a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**  
An architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on stateless, client-server communication, and uses HTTP methods for CRUD operations.

### S

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**  
An architectural style that supports service orientation. It is a way of designing software in the form of interoperable services, which can be used and reused across different systems.

**Singleton Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is often used for managing shared resources.

**SOLID Principles**  
A set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They include the Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.

**State Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changes its class.

**Strategy Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

### T

**Template Method Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

**Trait**  
A mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages like PHP. Traits are similar to classes, but are intended to group functionality in a fine-grained and consistent way.

### U

**Unit of Work Pattern**  
A design pattern that maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes and the resolution of concurrency problems. It ensures that all changes are committed or rolled back as a single unit.

**Union Types**  
A feature introduced in PHP 8 that allows a variable to hold multiple types. It is useful for functions that can accept multiple types of arguments.

### V

**Visitor Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures.

### W

**WebSocket**  
A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is used for real-time web applications.

### X

**XML (Extensible Markup Language)**  
A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is often used for data interchange between systems.

### Y

**YAGNI Principle**  
"You Aren't Gonna Need It" is a principle of extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until it is necessary. It helps in avoiding unnecessary complexity.
