## 22.10 Refactoring Anti-Patterns

Refactoring is a critical aspect of software development, aimed at improving the structure and readability of code without altering its external behavior. However, the process is fraught with potential pitfalls known as anti-patterns. In this section, we'll delve into common refactoring anti-patterns in PHP, such as the Big Rewrite and ignoring tests, and provide best practices to ensure effective and safe refactoring.

### Understanding Refactoring Anti-Patterns

Refactoring anti-patterns are practices that developers might inadvertently adopt, which can lead to negative consequences such as increased complexity, introduction of bugs, or wasted effort. Recognizing these anti-patterns is the first step towards avoiding them and ensuring that refactoring efforts lead to cleaner, more maintainable code.

### Big Rewrite (Second-System Syndrome)

#### Concept

The Big Rewrite, often referred to as Second-System Syndrome, is the temptation to completely rewrite an existing system from scratch. This anti-pattern arises from the belief that starting over will lead to a cleaner, more efficient system. However, it often results in significant delays, increased costs, and the introduction of new bugs.

#### Why It Happens

- **Frustration with Legacy Code:** Developers may find existing codebases difficult to work with due to poor documentation, lack of tests, or convoluted logic.
- **Desire for Perfection:** The allure of creating a "perfect" system can lead developers to believe that a fresh start is the best approach.
- **Underestimating Complexity:** Developers may underestimate the complexity and effort required to replicate existing functionality.

#### Consequences

- **Delays and Cost Overruns:** Rewriting a system from scratch is time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- **Loss of Valuable Features:** Important features and bug fixes from the original system may be overlooked or lost.
- **Introduction of New Bugs:** New code is prone to new bugs, which may not be immediately apparent.

#### Best Practices

- **Incremental Refactoring:** Focus on refactoring small parts of the system incrementally. This approach allows for continuous improvement without the risks associated with a complete rewrite.
- **Prioritize Critical Areas:** Identify and refactor the most problematic areas of the codebase first.
- **Leverage Existing Tests:** Use existing tests to ensure that refactoring does not break current functionality.

### Ignoring Tests During Refactoring

#### Concept

Ignoring tests during refactoring is a dangerous anti-pattern where developers modify code without running or updating tests. This practice can lead to the introduction of new bugs and regression issues.

#### Why It Happens

- **Time Constraints:** Developers may skip testing due to tight deadlines or perceived time savings.
- **Lack of Test Coverage:** Inadequate test coverage can make it difficult to identify which tests need to be updated.
- **Overconfidence:** Developers may believe that their changes are minor and do not require testing.

#### Consequences

- **Introduction of Bugs:** Without tests, it's easy to introduce bugs that go unnoticed until they cause significant issues.
- **Regression Issues:** Changes may inadvertently break existing functionality, leading to regression issues.
- **Increased Maintenance Costs:** Debugging and fixing issues post-refactoring can be costly and time-consuming.

#### Best Practices

- **Maintain Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Ensure that your codebase has comprehensive test coverage before refactoring.
- **Run Tests Continuously:** Use automated testing tools to run tests continuously during the refactoring process.
- **Update Tests as Needed:** Modify existing tests or write new ones to cover changes made during refactoring.

### Code Examples

Let's explore some code examples to illustrate these concepts.

#### Example: Incremental Refactoring

Consider a legacy PHP function that calculates the total price of items in a cart, including tax and discounts:

```php
function calculateTotalPrice($items, $taxRate, $discount) {
    $total = 0;
    foreach ($items as $item) {
        $total += $item['price'] * $item['quantity'];
    }
    $total += $total * $taxRate;
    $total -= $discount;
    return $total;
}
```

This function can be refactored incrementally to improve readability and maintainability:

```php
function calculateItemTotal($item) {
    return $item['price'] * $item['quantity'];
}

function applyTax($total, $taxRate) {
    return $total + ($total * $taxRate);
}

function applyDiscount($total, $discount) {
    return $total - $discount;
}

function calculateTotalPrice($items, $taxRate, $discount) {
    $total = array_reduce($items, function($carry, $item) {
        return $carry + calculateItemTotal($item);
    }, 0);

    $total = applyTax($total, $taxRate);
    $total = applyDiscount($total, $discount);

    return $total;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Modular Functions:** Break down the function into smaller, reusable functions.
- **Improved Readability:** Each function has a clear purpose, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

#### Example: Testing During Refactoring

Suppose we have a test case for the original `calculateTotalPrice` function:

```php
class PriceCalculatorTest extends PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase {
    public function testCalculateTotalPrice() {
        $items = [
            ['price' => 10, 'quantity' => 2],
            ['price' => 5, 'quantity' => 3]
        ];
        $taxRate = 0.1;
        $discount = 5;
        $expectedTotal = 31.5;

        $this->assertEquals($expectedTotal, calculateTotalPrice($items, $taxRate, $discount));
    }
}
```

After refactoring, we should ensure that the test still passes:

```bash
$ phpunit PriceCalculatorTest
```

**Key Points:**

- **Run Tests Continuously:** Ensure that tests are run continuously to catch any issues introduced during refactoring.
- **Update Tests as Needed:** If the refactoring changes the function's behavior, update the tests accordingly.

### Visualizing Refactoring Anti-Patterns

To better understand the impact of refactoring anti-patterns, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid

    B -- No --> D{Ignoring Tests?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Introduction of Bugs]
    D -- No --> F[Incremental Refactoring]
    F --> G[Improved Code Quality]
    C --> H[Delays and Cost Overruns]

    H --> I[Negative Impact]

```
