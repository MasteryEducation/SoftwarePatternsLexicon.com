## 27.4 Implementing a Real-Time Chat Application

In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of building a real-time chat application using PHP. This case study will guide you through the process of implementing a seamless messaging system that allows users to communicate in real-time. We will explore the use of design patterns such as the Mediator and Observer patterns, and leverage WebSocket servers like Ratchet or Swoole to maintain persistent connections.

### Objective

The primary objective of this case study is to provide a comprehensive guide on implementing a real-time chat application that ensures seamless communication between users. The application will focus on:

- Providing real-time message delivery.
- Maintaining persistent connections.
- Ensuring message ordering and reliability.

### Patterns Utilized

To achieve the objectives, we will utilize the following design patterns:

- **Mediator Pattern:** This pattern will be used to handle message routing between users, acting as a central hub that manages communication.
- **Observer Pattern:** This pattern will be employed to update clients on new messages, ensuring that all connected clients receive updates in real-time.

### Implementation Highlights

The implementation will involve setting up a WebSocket server using either Ratchet or Swoole. These tools provide the necessary infrastructure to handle real-time communication efficiently.

- **Ratchet:** A PHP library for building real-time, bi-directional applications between clients and servers over WebSockets.
  - **Link:** [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/)
- **Swoole:** A coroutine-based asynchronous PHP extension that enhances the performance of PHP applications.
  - **Link:** [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/)

### Challenges Addressed

Building a real-time chat application comes with its own set of challenges. In this guide, we will address:

- **Maintaining Persistent Connections:** Ensuring that connections remain open and stable for real-time communication.
- **Ensuring Message Delivery and Ordering:** Guaranteeing that messages are delivered in the correct order and without loss.

### Setting Up the Environment

Before we dive into the implementation, let's set up the environment required for building our chat application.

#### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Composer
- A WebSocket server (Ratchet or Swoole)
- A database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) for storing chat history

#### Installing Ratchet

To install Ratchet, use Composer to add it to your project:

```bash
composer require cboden/ratchet
```

#### Installing Swoole

To install Swoole, you can use the following command:

```bash
pecl install swoole
```

Ensure that the Swoole extension is enabled in your `php.ini` file.

### Designing the Chat Application

Let's start by designing the architecture of our chat application. We'll use the Mediator and Observer patterns to manage communication and updates.

#### Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern will serve as the central hub for message routing. It will manage the communication between different clients, ensuring that messages are delivered to the correct recipients.

**Key Participants:**

- **Mediator Interface:** Defines the contract for communication.
- **Concrete Mediator:** Implements the communication logic.
- **Colleague Classes:** Represent the clients that communicate through the mediator.

#### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern will be used to notify clients of new messages. When a message is sent, all connected clients will be updated in real-time.

**Key Participants:**

- **Subject Interface:** Defines the contract for managing observers.
- **Concrete Subject:** Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
- **Observer Interface:** Defines the contract for receiving updates.
- **Concrete Observer:** Implements the update logic.

### Implementing the Chat Application

Now that we have a clear understanding of the design, let's implement the chat application.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the WebSocket Server

We'll start by setting up a WebSocket server using Ratchet. The server will handle incoming connections and messages.

```php
<?php

use Ratchet\MessageComponentInterface;
use Ratchet\ConnectionInterface;

class ChatServer implements MessageComponentInterface {
    protected $clients;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->clients = new \SplObjectStorage;
    }

    public function onOpen(ConnectionInterface $conn) {
        // Store the new connection
        $this->clients->attach($conn);
        echo "New connection! ({$conn->resourceId})\n";
    }

    public function onMessage(ConnectionInterface $from, $msg) {
        // Broadcast the message to all clients
        foreach ($this->clients as $client) {
            if ($from !== $client) {
                $client->send($msg);
            }
        }
    }

    public function onClose(ConnectionInterface $conn) {
        // Remove the connection
        $this->clients->detach($conn);
        echo "Connection {$conn->resourceId} has disconnected\n";
    }

    public function onError(ConnectionInterface $conn, \Exception $e) {
        echo "An error has occurred: {$e->getMessage()}\n";
        $conn->close();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Running the WebSocket Server

To run the WebSocket server, create a script that initializes the server and listens for connections.

```php
<?php

use Ratchet\Server\IoServer;
use Ratchet\Http\HttpServer;
use Ratchet\WebSocket\WsServer;

require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$server = IoServer::factory(
    new HttpServer(
        new WsServer(
            new ChatServer()
        )
    ),
    8080
);

$server->run();
```

#### Step 3: Implementing the Client-Side

On the client-side, we'll use JavaScript to establish a WebSocket connection and handle incoming messages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Real-Time Chat</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="chat">
        <div id="messages"></div>
        <input type="text" id="message" placeholder="Type a message...">
        <button id="send">Send</button>
    </div>

    <script>
        const conn = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

        conn.onopen = function() {
            console.log('Connection established!');
        };

        conn.onmessage = function(e) {
            const messages = document.getElementById('messages');
            messages.innerHTML += `<p>${e.data}</p>`;
        };

        document.getElementById('send').onclick = function() {
            const message = document.getElementById('message').value;
            conn.send(message);
            document.getElementById('message').value = '';
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Ensuring Message Delivery and Ordering

To ensure message delivery and ordering, we can implement a message queue or use a database to store messages temporarily. This ensures that messages are not lost and are delivered in the correct order.

### Handling Persistent Connections

Maintaining persistent connections is crucial for a real-time chat application. WebSockets provide a way to keep connections open, allowing for continuous communication between the client and server.

### Visualizing the Architecture

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the flow of messages in our chat application.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client1
    participant WebSocketServer
    participant Client2

    Client1->>WebSocketServer: Send Message
    WebSocketServer->>Client2: Broadcast Message
    Client2->>WebSocketServer: Acknowledge Receipt
    WebSocketServer->>Client1: Acknowledge Delivery
```

### Try It Yourself
