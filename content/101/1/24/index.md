## Introduction

Data Sampling is a vital pattern within data ingestion systems, especially in scenarios where full data capture might be unnecessary or resource-intensive. It involves ingesting only a subset of data, useful in reducing processing load, saving storage, or during testing phases of system development.

## Design Pattern Overview

Data Sampling can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitoring key performance metrics by collecting a fraction of the data rather than all the available data.
- **System Testing**: Testing new systems or processes with a small, representative portion of the data before full-scale deployment.
- **Resource Optimization**: Limiting data ingestion to preserve bandwidth, reduce storage costs, or lower processing requirements.

## Example Use Case

Imagine a web server that produces thousands of log entries every second. For performance monitoring, it might be sufficient to collect every tenth log entry or log entries with specific error codes rather than all entries, significantly reducing the amount of data processed and stored.

## Architectural Approaches

### 1. Random Sampling

Random Sampling involves selecting random data points from the data stream to ensure unbiased representation. It does not require prior knowledge of data but might be inefficient for specific pattern detection.

```scala
def randomSample[T](stream: Stream[T], sampleRate: Double): Stream[T] = {
  stream.filter(_ => Math.random() < sampleRate)
}
```

### 2. Systematic Sampling

Systematic Sampling involves selecting data at regular intervals, such as every nth data point. It is easy to implement and may be more predictable in processing.

```scala
def systematicSample[T](stream: Stream[T], step: Int): Stream[T] = {
  stream.zipWithIndex.collect { case (value, index) if index % step == 0 => value }
}
```

### 3. Stratified Sampling

Stratified Sampling divides data into distinct strata (subsets) and samples within each subsample. It ensures that each category is represented in the sample proportionally.

```kotlin
fun <T> stratifiedSample(stream: List<T>, strata: (T) -> String, rate: Double): List<T> {
  return stream.groupBy(strata).flatMap { (_, list) ->
    list.filter { Math.random() < rate }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Define Sampling Requirements**: Clearly define why and what type of sampling is needed to ensure you get value from the data without wasting resources.
- **Ensure Data Representativeness**: Choose the sampling method that preserves the representativeness of your critical data.
- **Validate Sampled Data**: Continuously monitor and validate the sampled data to avoid biases that could impact decision-making.

## Related Patterns and Concepts

- **Data Filtering Pattern**: Involves filtering incoming data based on specific criteria and is often used in conjunction with data sampling to refine ingest data.
- **Data Compression Pattern**: Focuses on reducing data size while maintaining information that can be combined with data sampling for more effective data handling.
- **Load Shedding Pattern**: Deals with system overloads by reducing the volume of data being processed, where sampling can provide a controlled reduction.

## Summary

Data Sampling is an essential pattern in data processing and ingestion strategies. By focusing resource utilization and enhancing system performance, it allows systems to make informed decisions without consuming excessive data. By selecting the right sampling method and checking its effectiveness, organizations can efficiently handle a wide array of streaming data applications.

Use these strategies and best practices to make the most of Data Sampling in your own architectures while ensuring data validity and representation.
