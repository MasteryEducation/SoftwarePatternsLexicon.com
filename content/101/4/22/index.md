### Accumulating vs. Discarding Windows

When working with stream processing systems, one of the critical decisions is how to handle windowed data: Should the system accumulate states over time or discard them at each window's conclusion? This decision impacts the memory usage, latency, and accuracy of the results generated from the streaming data.

#### Description

The concept of windows in stream processing allows systems to batch sections of the endless data stream so that meaningful computations can be performed. Windows can be time-based, count-based, or triggered by other domain-specific events.

- **Accumulating Windows**: In this pattern, all the state and computations within a window are accumulated and exposed even after the window closes. Thus, subsequent windows can access and use this accumulated state. This is often useful in scenarios where historical context or trending information is necessary.

- **Discarding Windows**: In contrast, this pattern involves discarding the state as soon as the window closes. A new window starts computation from scratch, effectively resetting any state. This is suitable for scenarios focused on short-term or real-time analytics, where past data is irrelevant.

#### Example

Consider a retail analytics application:

- **Accumulating Example**: The system accumulates sales totals across each window and provides cumulative sales data over the respective periods. This aids in recognizing sales trends, generating reports, and forecasting by leveraging historic data accumulation.

- **Discarding Example**: After the sales data is analyzed at the end of a window, the state is reset, and a new window begins with no prior sales data knowledge. This helps in focusing on the current sales performance without bias from historical results.

#### Architectural Considerations

- **State Management**: Accumulating windows require a state store, often implemented using key-value storage systems, capable of efficiently handling large volumes of data over potentially long periods. Technologies like Apache Flink and Kafka Streams offer robust state management features for these use cases.

- **Memory Usage**: The choice between accumulating and discarding windows impact memory usage. Accumulating windows consume more memory as they retain state over window closures, whereas discarding windows clear state and thus require less memory.

- **Latency vs. Complexity**: Accumulating windows potentially introduce latency due to state lookups and management complexity. However, they provide richer insights, as opposed to discarding windows, which prioritize low latency and minimal state management.

#### Example Code

Here is a pseudocode example illustrating accumulating and discarding windows:

```scala
// Accumulating Window Configuration
val salesStream = dataStream
  .window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.hours(1), Time.minutes(30)))
  .reduce((sale1, sale2) => sale1.totalSales + sale2.totalSales)

// Discarding Window Configuration
val salesStream = dataStream
  .window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.hours(1)))
  .reduce((sale1, sale2) => sale1.totalSales + sale2.totalSales)
  .afterWindowClose((window) => window.resetState())
```

#### Related Patterns

- **Sliding Windows**: Windows that slide over time, continuously emitting results and potentially accumulating state.
- **Tumbling Windows**: Fixed-duration windows that do not overlap, often used in discarding window patterns.
- **Session Windows**: Dynamic windows that are defined based on user session activity.

#### Summary

Choosing between accumulating and discarding windows is a vital design decision in stream processing architectures. While accumulating windows offer enriched data contexts and insights over time, discarding windows are optimal for low-latency, real-time stream analytics. Understanding the trade-offs and requirements of your specific application scenario is crucial to selecting the right windowing strategy. As data volume and velocity continue to grow, this decision increasingly impacts the efficiency and usability of streaming data architectures.
