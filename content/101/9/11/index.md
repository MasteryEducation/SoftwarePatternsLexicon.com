## Overview

Data validation and sanitization are critical in stream processing systems to ensure that only clean and valid data is processed. This pattern involves checking incoming data streams to detect incorrect or malicious data formats and structures, and applying transformations or filters to cleanse the data.

## Use Cases

- **Data Compliance**: Enforcing data integrity constraints before processing.
- **Security Enhancement**: Preventing SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks in web applications leveraging data streams.
- **Error Prevention**: Reducing system failures by filtering out duplicates and malformed data.

## Benefits

- **Improved Data Quality**: Ensures that data streams are reliable and trustworthy.
- **Enhanced Security**: Protects against data-driven attacks by sanitizing inputs.
- **Resilience**: Minimizes processing errors and service disruptions by handling unexpected data formats gracefully.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Data Validation**: Verify each incoming data element against predefined validation rules.
   - Example: Check data types, required fields, range constraints, etc.

2. **Data Sanitization**: Modify or remove parts of the data that do not meet the criteria.
   - Example: Escape special characters, strip unwanted tags, convert data to safe formats.

3. **Layered Approach**: Implement validation and sanitization across multiple layers in the data processing pipeline.
   - Pre-ingest checks.
   - In-stream transformation rules.
   - Post-processing audits.

4. **Automation**: Use automated tools and libraries to apply validation rules consistently.
   - Examples: Apache Nifi for data flow automation, libraries like Validator.js for JavaScript.

## Example Code

Here is an example demonstrating data validation and sanitization using a simplified streaming application in JavaScript:

```javascript
const inputData = [
    { name: "<script>alert('XSS')</script>", age: "Twenty" },
    { name: "Alice", age: "30" },
    { name: "Bob", age: 25 }
];

/**
 * Data validation and sanitization function.
 * @param {Array} dataStream - Array of data objects in the stream.
 * @returns {Array} - Array of validated and sanitized data objects.
 */
function validateAndSanitizeData(dataStream) {
    return dataStream
        .filter(validateData)
        .map(sanitizeData);
}

/**
 * Validate data object.
 * @param {Object} data - Data object from the stream.
 * @returns {boolean} - Return true if the data object is valid.
 */
function validateData(data) {
    const hasValidAge = typeof data.age === 'number';
    const hasValidName = typeof data.name === 'string' && data.name.trim().length > 0;
    return hasValidAge && hasValidName;
}

/**
 * Sanitize data object.
 * @param {Object} data - Data object from the stream.
 * @returns {Object} - Sanitized data object.
 */
function sanitizeData(data) {
    return {
        name: data.name.replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;"),
        age: data.age
    };
}

const sanitizedData = validateAndSanitizeData(inputData);
console.log(sanitizedData);
```

## Related Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Provides stability on overload by stopping the flow of data to downstream processors temporarily.
- **Retry Pattern**: Increases data quality and reliability by reprocessing invalid data once it is corrected.

## Summary

The Validation and Sanitization pattern ensures that data processing systems are robust, secure, and reliable. By implementing thorough validation and sanitization mechanisms, systems can handle malicious or unexpected data safely, improving overall data quality and operational efficiency. This pattern is vital in stream processing domains where high data volume and velocity demand thorough input quality controls.
