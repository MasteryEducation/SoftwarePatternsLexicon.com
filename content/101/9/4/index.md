## Acknowledgment Patterns

Acknowledgment Patterns are critical in distributed systems and stream processing environments. They deal with ensuring that messages are processed successfully by requiring acknowledgments from downstream systems before considering a message completely processed and removing it from the queue. This ensures that if a service or system fails before processing, or an error occurs, the message isn’t lost and can be retried.

### Detailed Explanation

Acknowledgment Patterns are essential in environments where message delivery and processing reliability are crucial. This pattern is especially applicable in:

- **Message Queues**: Systems like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Amazon SQS, where acknowledging message reception is integral in maintaining system resilience.
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Ensuring that messages or events reach their intended destination and are processed correctly.
- **Error Recovery**: Assisting in recovery scenarios where message processing failure necessitates re-delivery or delayed processing.

### Architectural Approaches

1. **Manual Acknowledgment**: The consumer of the message explicitly sends an acknowledgment after processing. This allows control over when a message is expunged from the queue.
   
   ```java
   channel.basicConsume(queueName, false, deliverCallback, consumerTag -> { });
   channel.basicAck(delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false);
   ```

2. **Automatic Acknowledgment**: Immediately acknowledges receipt of the message, assuming all messages are processed without incident.
   
   ```java
   channel.basicConsume(queueName, true, deliverCallback, consumerTag -> { });
   ```

3. **Negative Acknowledgment (Nack)**: Signals that a message was `not` processed successfully, indicating it needs redelivery or alternative handling.
   
   ```java
   channel.basicNack(delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false, true);
   ```

4. **Timeout-based Acknowledgment**: Automatic acknowledgment if not explicitly confirmed by the consumer within a predetermined timeframe, useful for preventing deadlocks in processing workflows.

### Best Practices

- Employ **Idempotent Operations** within your message handlers to ensure that reprocessing a message does not produce unintended side effects.
- Use **Delayed Retries** for handling transient failures effectively.
- Implement a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** where unprocessable messages are routed for further inspection and analysis.

### Related Patterns

- **Retry Pattern**: Re-attempts sending messages that result in temporary errors or failures.
- **Dead Letter Queue Pattern**: Segregates failed messages that can't be processed after several retries for future analysis.
- **Idempotency Patterns**: Ensures that operations can be repeated without altering outcomes undesirably.

### Example Code

```java
import com.rabbitmq.client.*;

public class AcknowledgmentExample {
    private final static String QUEUE_NAME = "exampleQueue";

    public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
        ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
        factory.setHost("localhost");
        try (Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
             Channel channel = connection.createChannel()) {
            channel.queueDeclare(QUEUE_NAME, false, false, false, null);
            DeliverCallback deliverCallback = (consumerTag, delivery) -> {
                String message = new String(delivery.getBody(), "UTF-8");
                try {
                    processMessage(message);
                    channel.basicAck(delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    channel.basicNack(delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false, true);
                }
            };
            channel.basicConsume(QUEUE_NAME, false, deliverCallback, consumerTag -> { });
        }
    }

    private static void processMessage(String message) {
        // Process the message
    }
}
```

### Summary

Acknowledgment Patterns in stream processing and distributed systems are crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring message delivery success. By implementing this pattern, systems can achieve higher reliability and fault-tolerance, reducing losses from failed transmissions and processing errors.
