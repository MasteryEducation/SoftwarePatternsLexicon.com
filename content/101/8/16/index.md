## Introduction

The Conditional Pattern Detection design pattern is critical in scenarios where data streams are monitored for complex conditional events. This pattern is pertinent in environments where real-time decisions need to be made on incoming data, such as financial services for fraud detection, IoT environments for anomaly detection, or any system requiring instant alerts and responses based on specific event patterns mixed with conditional logic.

## Problem Statement

In real-time data streams, identifying and responding to patterns based on complex logic is both necessary and challenging. A simple rule-based detection is frequently insufficient for detecting nuanced events where multiple conditions are involved. For example, detecting a high-value transaction without prior authentication in an e-commerce system requires:

- Monitoring the transaction value.
- Checking the authentication status.
- Maintaining context over time to determine the absence of authentication within a specified period.

## Solution

The solution involves the integration of Stream Processing Engines capable of handling Complex Event Processing (CEP). Such engines can handle defined patterns that transcend basic filtering and complex conditional evaluation. The steps to implement the Conditional Pattern Detection include:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Utilize data pipelines to ingest data into a real-time processing engine like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis.
   
2. **Pattern Definition**: Define the conditional pattern logic using a CEP language like Apache Flink SQL or Esper, where complex conditions and temporal constraints can be specified.

3. **State Management**: Employ stateful computations to manage historical context between events, necessary for detecting the absence as well as presence of events over time.

4. **Alerting and Action**: Trigger alerts or automated actions when the pattern is detected, using push notifications, logs, or automated scripts.

## Example Code

Below is a simplified code example using Apache Flink for detecting a high-value transaction without prior authentication within an hour:

```java
DataStream<Event> stream = ... // assume this is your incoming stream

Pattern<Event, ?> pattern = Pattern.<Event>begin("start")
    .where(_.getType() == Event.Type.TRANSACTION)
    .where(event -> event.getValue() > 10000)
    .next("end")
    .where(_.getType() == Event.Type.AUTHENTICATION)
    .notNext("authentication").timesOrMore(0);

PatternStream<Event> patternStream = CEP.pattern(stream, pattern)
    .inProcessingTime.within(Time.hours(1));

patternStream.select((Map<String, List<Event>> pattern) -> {
    Event transaction = pattern.get("start").get(0);

    return new Alert(transaction.getTransactionId(), "High-value transaction without authentication");
});
```

## Related Patterns

- **Event Aggregation Pattern**: Aggregates streaming data into logical structures for easy pattern matching.
- **Stateful Stream Processing**: Maintains state within streams, essential for tracking historical events.
- **Time Window Pattern**: Segments the stream into time-based windows for analysis.

## Summary

The Conditional Pattern Detection design pattern provides a structured approach to detecting complex patterns in real-time data streams. By leveraging advanced stream processing technologies and event processing engines, this pattern can enable sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems, ensuring that critical conditions are not only detected but acted upon swiftly. It plays a vital role in industries requiring immediate response to event sequences, enhancing the decision-making process with timely insights.
