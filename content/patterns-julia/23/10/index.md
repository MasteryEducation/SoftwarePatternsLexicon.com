### Code Examples

To illustrate Julia's capabilities, let's explore a simple example of how Julia can be used for data analysis in the healthcare sector.

```julia
using DataFrames
using CSV

patient_data = CSV.File("patient_data.csv") |> DataFrame

println(first(patient_data, 5))

average_age = mean(patient_data.age)
println("Average Age of Patients: ", average_age)

condition_patients = filter(row -> row.condition == "Hypertension", patient_data)

println("Number of Patients with Hypertension: ", nrow(condition_patients))
```

In this example, we demonstrate how Julia can be used to load and analyze patient data efficiently. The code loads data from a CSV file, calculates the average age of patients, and filters patients with a specific condition. This showcases Julia's ability to handle data analysis tasks with ease and speed.
