## 12.5 Statistical Computing with Statistics.jl and Distributions.jl

Statistical computing is a cornerstone of data analysis, enabling us to extract meaningful insights from data. In Julia, the `Statistics.jl` and `Distributions.jl` packages provide powerful tools for performing statistical computations and working with probability distributions. This section will guide you through the essential features of these packages, helping you to master statistical computing in Julia.

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics provide a way to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Let's explore how to calculate key descriptive statistics using `Statistics.jl`.

#### Summarizing Data

To begin, we need to calculate basic statistics such as the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. These metrics give us a quick overview of the data's central tendency and variability.

```julia
using Statistics

data = [23, 45, 67, 89, 12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 21]

mean_value = mean(data)
println("Mean: $mean_value")

median_value = median(data)
println("Median: $median_value")

variance_value = var(data)
println("Variance: $variance_value")

std_dev_value = std(data)
println("Standard Deviation: $std_dev_value")
```

In this example, we use the `mean`, `median`, `var`, and `std` functions to compute the respective statistics. These functions are part of the `Statistics.jl` package, which is included in Julia's standard library.

### Probability Distributions

Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes. The `Distributions.jl` package in Julia provides a comprehensive suite of tools for working with probability distributions.

#### Defining and Sampling

Let's explore how to define and sample from various probability distributions, including normal, Poisson, and uniform distributions.

```julia
using Distributions

normal_dist = Normal(0, 1)

samples = rand(normal_dist, 5)
println("Normal Distribution Samples: $samples")

poisson_dist = Poisson(3)

poisson_samples = rand(poisson_dist, 5)
println("Poisson Distribution Samples: $poisson_samples")

uniform_dist = Uniform(0, 1)

uniform_samples = rand(uniform_dist, 5)
println("Uniform Distribution Samples: $uniform_samples")
```

In this code, we define three different distributions using `Normal`, `Poisson`, and `Uniform` constructors. We then use the `rand` function to sample random values from these distributions.

### Statistical Tests

Statistical tests are used to make inferences about populations based on sample data. Let's explore how to perform hypothesis testing using `Statistics.jl` and `Distributions.jl`.

#### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing involves comparing sample data to a null hypothesis to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We'll demonstrate how to perform t-tests, chi-squared tests, and ANOVA.

**T-Test**

A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups. Here's how to perform a t-test in Julia:

```julia
using Statistics, HypothesisTests

group1 = [23, 45, 67, 89, 12]
group2 = [34, 56, 78, 90, 21]

t_test_result = ttest(group1, group2)
println("T-Test Result: $(t_test_result.pvalue)")
```

**Chi-Squared Test**

A chi-squared test is used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables. Here's an example:

```julia
using HypothesisTests

observed = [20, 30, 50]

expected = [25, 25, 50]

chi_squared_result = ChisqTest(observed, expected)
println("Chi-Squared Test Result: $(chi_squared_result.pvalue)")
```

**ANOVA**

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to compare the means of three or more groups. Here's how to perform ANOVA in Julia:

```julia
using StatsBase

group1 = [23, 45, 67, 89, 12]
group2 = [34, 56, 78, 90, 21]
group3 = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]

anova_result = anova([group1, group2, group3])
println("ANOVA Result: $(anova_result)")
```

### Use Cases and Examples

Statistical computing is widely used in various fields, including research and quality control. Let's explore some practical use cases.

#### Data Analysis in Research

Researchers often use statistical computing to analyze experimental data. For example, a biologist might use statistical tests to determine if a new drug has a significant effect on a disease.

#### Quality Control in Manufacturing

In manufacturing, statistical computing is used to monitor and control product quality. For instance, a factory might use control charts to detect variations in the production process.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics, it's time to experiment with the code examples. Try modifying the parameters of the distributions or the sample data for the statistical tests. Observe how the results change and think about the implications.

### Visualizing Statistical Concepts

To enhance your understanding, let's visualize some statistical concepts using diagrams.

#### Probability Distribution Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Probability Distribution] --> B[Normal Distribution];
    A --> C[Poisson Distribution];
    A --> D[Uniform Distribution];
    B --> E[Mean = 0, SD = 1];
    C --> F[λ = 3];
    D --> G[Range 0 to 1];
```
