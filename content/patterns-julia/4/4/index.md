## 4.4 Emulating Object-Oriented Programming with Structs and Methods

In the world of software development, object-oriented programming (OOP) has long been a popular paradigm, offering a way to structure code that models real-world entities. While Julia is not inherently an object-oriented language, it provides powerful features that allow developers to emulate OOP concepts effectively. In this section, we will explore how to use Julia's structs and methods to achieve this, focusing on defining structs, associating methods, and emulating inheritance and interfaces.

### Defining Structs

In Julia, structs are used to define composite data types. They are similar to classes in object-oriented languages but come with some differences. Julia offers two types of structs: mutable and immutable.

#### Mutable and Immutable Structs

**Immutable Structs**: These are the default in Julia and are defined using the `struct` keyword. Once an instance of an immutable struct is created, its fields cannot be changed. This immutability can lead to performance optimizations, as the compiler can make certain assumptions about the data.

```julia
struct Point
    x::Float64
    y::Float64
end

p = Point(1.0, 2.0)

println("x: ", p.x, ", y: ", p.y)
```

**Mutable Structs**: If you need to change the fields of a struct after it has been created, you can define a mutable struct using the `mutable struct` keyword.

```julia
mutable struct MutablePoint
    x::Float64
    y::Float64
end

mp = MutablePoint(1.0, 2.0)

mp.x = 3.0
mp.y = 4.0

println("x: ", mp.x, ", y: ", mp.y)
```

### Associating Methods

In Julia, methods are functions that can operate on structs. Unlike traditional OOP languages where methods are defined within classes, Julia separates data (structs) from behavior (methods). This separation allows for more flexible and powerful programming patterns.

#### Implementing Methods that Operate on Structs

To associate methods with a struct, you define functions that take instances of the struct as arguments. This approach leverages Julia's multiple dispatch feature, allowing you to define different behaviors for functions based on the types of their arguments.

```julia
function distance(p::Point)
    return sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)
end

p = Point(3.0, 4.0)
println("Distance from origin: ", distance(p))
```

**Multiple Dispatch**: This feature allows you to define multiple methods for the same function name, each with different argument types. It is a powerful tool for creating flexible and reusable code.

```julia
function distance(p1::Point, p2::Point)
    return sqrt((p2.x - p1.x)^2 + (p2.y - p1.y)^2)
end

p1 = Point(1.0, 2.0)
p2 = Point(4.0, 6.0)
println("Distance between points: ", distance(p1, p2))
```

### Inheritance and Interfaces

While Julia does not support inheritance in the traditional OOP sense, it provides mechanisms to achieve similar functionality through abstract types and composition.

#### Using Abstract Types

Abstract types in Julia allow you to define a hierarchy of types without specifying their implementation. They serve as a blueprint for concrete types (structs) that inherit from them.

```julia
abstract type Shape end

struct Circle <: Shape
    radius::Float64
end

struct Rectangle <: Shape
    width::Float64
    height::Float64
end
```

#### Emulating Inheritance with Composition

Composition is a design principle where a struct contains instances of other structs, allowing you to build complex types from simpler ones. This approach is often preferred over inheritance as it promotes flexibility and reusability.

```julia
struct Wheel
    radius::Float64
end

struct Car
    wheels::Vector{Wheel}
    color::String
end

wheels = [Wheel(15.0), Wheel(15.0), Wheel(15.0), Wheel(15.0)]
car = Car(wheels, "Red")
```

#### Interfaces in Julia

Interfaces in Julia are not explicitly defined like in some other languages. Instead, they are a set of functions that a type must implement to be considered as implementing the interface. This is often documented as a convention.

```julia
function draw(obj)
    error("draw not implemented for $(typeof(obj))")
end

function draw(c::Circle)
    println("Drawing a circle with radius ", c.radius)
end

function draw(r::Rectangle)
    println("Drawing a rectangle with width ", r.width, " and height ", r.height)
end

c = Circle(5.0)
r = Rectangle(4.0, 3.0)
draw(c)
draw(r)
```

### Visualizing Structs and Methods in Julia

To better understand how structs and methods work together in Julia, let's visualize the relationship using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        <<abstract>>
    }
    class Circle {
        radius: Float64
    }
    class Rectangle {
        width: Float64
        height: Float64
    }
    Shape <|-- Circle
    Shape <|-- Rectangle
    class Car {
        wheels: Vector~Wheel~
        color: String
    }
    class Wheel {
        radius: Float64
    }
    Car o-- Wheel
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the relationship between the abstract type `Shape` and its concrete implementations `Circle` and `Rectangle`. It also shows the composition relationship between `Car` and `Wheel`.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples above:

- Add a new struct `Triangle` that implements the `Shape` interface.
- Define a method `area` for each shape that calculates its area.
- Create a new struct `Bicycle` that uses composition with `Wheel`.

### Key Takeaways

- **Structs** in Julia are used to define composite data types and can be mutable or immutable.
- **Methods** are functions that operate on structs, leveraging Julia's multiple dispatch for flexibility.
- **Abstract Types** and **Composition** are used to emulate inheritance and interfaces, promoting code reusability and flexibility.
