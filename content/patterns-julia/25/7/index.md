### Tutorials and Walkthroughs

In addition to sample projects, tutorials and walkthroughs provide step-by-step guidance on building applications in Julia. These resources are invaluable for understanding the intricacies of project development and implementation.

#### Tutorial 1: Building a Data Pipeline

- **Objective**: Learn how to build a data pipeline using Julia's data manipulation and visualization libraries.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Data Ingestion**: Use CSV.jl to read data from CSV files.
  2. **Data Transformation**: Apply transformations using DataFrames.jl.
  3. **Data Visualization**: Create plots using Plots.jl.
  4. **Reporting**: Generate reports with Markdown.jl.

**Code Example**:

```julia
using CSV, DataFrames, Plots

df = CSV.File("data.csv") |> DataFrame

df_transformed = filter(row -> row[:Age] > 18, df)

plot(df_transformed.Age, df_transformed.Salary, title="Age vs Salary", xlabel="Age", ylabel="Salary")

open("report.md", "w") do io
    write(io, "# Data Report\n\n")
    write(io, "## Age vs Salary\n\n")
    write(io, "![Plot](plot.png)\n")
end
```

**Try It Yourself**: Extend the pipeline to include additional data sources and more complex transformations.
