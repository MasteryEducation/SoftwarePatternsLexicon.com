## 7.3 Command Pattern for Reversible Operations

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations, making it a powerful tool in software design.

### Definition

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. This encapsulation also enables logging, queuing, and undoable operations.

### Implementing Command Pattern in Julia

In Julia, implementing the Command Pattern involves creating command structs that encapsulate actions. These structs typically include `execute` and `undo` methods. The pattern also involves an invoker that triggers commands and a receiver that performs the actual operations.

#### Command Structs

To implement the Command Pattern in Julia, we start by defining command structs. These structs represent actions and contain methods to execute and undo these actions.

```julia
abstract type Command end

struct AddCommand <: Command
    element::Int
    list::Vector{Int}
end

function execute(cmd::AddCommand)
    push!(cmd.list, cmd.element)
end

function undo(cmd::AddCommand)
    pop!(cmd.list)
end
```

In this example, `AddCommand` is a struct that implements the `Command` interface. It encapsulates the action of adding an element to a list, with `execute` and `undo` methods to perform and reverse the action, respectively.

#### Invoker and Receiver

The invoker is responsible for triggering commands, while the receiver is the entity that performs the actual operations. In our example, the list acts as the receiver.

```julia
struct Invoker
    history::Vector{Command}
end

function Invoker()
    return Invoker(Vector{Command}())
end

function execute_command(invoker::Invoker, cmd::Command)
    execute(cmd)
    push!(invoker.history, cmd)
end

function undo_last_command(invoker::Invoker)
    if !isempty(invoker.history)
        last_cmd = pop!(invoker.history)
        undo(last_cmd)
    end
end
```

The `Invoker` struct maintains a history of executed commands, allowing for undo functionality. The `execute_command` function executes a command and stores it in the history, while `undo_last_command` undoes the last executed command.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Command Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where actions need to be reversible or queued for later execution. Let's explore some common use cases.

#### Undo/Redo Functionality

Applications like text editors often require undo and redo functionality. The Command Pattern provides a structured way to implement this by maintaining a history of executed commands.

```julia
list = Int[]
invoker = Invoker()

cmd1 = AddCommand(10, list)
execute_command(invoker, cmd1) # list becomes [10]

cmd2 = AddCommand(20, list)
execute_command(invoker, cmd2) # list becomes [10, 20]

undo_last_command(invoker) # list reverts to [10]
undo_last_command(invoker) # list reverts to []
```

In this example, we demonstrate how commands can be executed and undone, providing a simple undo/redo mechanism.

#### Task Scheduling

The Command Pattern can also be used for task scheduling, where tasks are queued and executed in a controlled manner. This is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be executed in a specific order or at specific times.

```julia
struct PrintCommand <: Command
    message::String
end

function execute(cmd::PrintCommand)
    println(cmd.message)
end

function undo(cmd::PrintCommand)
    println("Undo: ", cmd.message)
end

task1 = PrintCommand("Task 1")
task2 = PrintCommand("Task 2")

execute_command(invoker, task1) # prints "Task 1"
execute_command(invoker, task2) # prints "Task 2"

undo_last_command(invoker) # prints "Undo: Task 2"
```

Here, `PrintCommand` is used to encapsulate print tasks, which can be scheduled and executed by the invoker.

### Visualizing the Command Pattern

To better understand the Command Pattern, let's visualize its components and interactions using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        +execute()
        +undo()
    }
    class AddCommand {
        +element: Int
        +list: Vector{Int}
        +execute()
        +undo()
    }
    class Invoker {
        +history: Vector{Command}
        +execute_command(cmd: Command)
        +undo_last_command()
    }
    Command <|-- AddCommand
    Invoker o-- Command
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Command` interface, the `AddCommand` implementation, and the `Invoker`. The `Invoker` maintains a history of commands, allowing for execution and undo operations.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Command Pattern in Julia, consider the following:

- **Reversibility**: Ensure that each command can be undone. This may require additional state management within the command structs.
- **Complexity**: The Command Pattern can introduce complexity, especially when managing a large number of commands. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the complexity for your specific use case.
- **Performance**: Storing a history of commands can consume memory. Optimize the storage and retrieval of commands as needed.

### Differences and Similarities

The Command Pattern is often compared to other behavioral patterns, such as the Strategy Pattern. While both patterns encapsulate actions, the Command Pattern focuses on reversible operations and queuing, whereas the Strategy Pattern is more about selecting algorithms at runtime.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Command Pattern by modifying the code examples. Try creating new command types, such as `RemoveCommand`, and implement their `execute` and `undo` methods. Consider how you might extend the pattern to support redo functionality.
