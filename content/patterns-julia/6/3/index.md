## 6.3 Composite Pattern with Recursive Data Structures

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that enables you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, simplifying the client code and enhancing flexibility. In Julia, the Composite Pattern can be effectively implemented using recursive data structures, unified interfaces, and parametric types.

### Definition

- **Composes objects into tree structures** to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly**, providing a consistent interface for both.

### Implementing Composite Pattern in Julia

#### Recursive Types

In Julia, recursive types are a powerful way to implement the Composite Pattern. By defining structs that can contain instances of themselves, you can create flexible and scalable data structures.

```julia
abstract type FileSystem end

struct File <: FileSystem
    name::String
    size::Int
end

struct Directory <: FileSystem
    name::String
    contents::Vector{FileSystem}
end
```

In this example, we define an abstract type `FileSystem` and two concrete types, `File` and `Directory`. The `Directory` type contains a vector of `FileSystem` instances, allowing it to hold both files and other directories.

#### Unified Interfaces

To treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, implement methods that operate on both single elements and composites. This can be achieved by defining functions that work with the abstract type and dispatching them based on the concrete type.

```julia
function total_size(fs::FileSystem)
    if fs isa File
        return fs.size
    elseif fs isa Directory
        return sum(total_size(item) for item in fs.contents)
    end
end
```

The `total_size` function calculates the total size of a `FileSystem` object. It checks if the object is a `File` or a `Directory` and performs the appropriate calculation, demonstrating how to handle both individual and composite objects uniformly.

#### Parametric Types

Parametric types in Julia allow you to handle different kinds of components within your composite structure. This is particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous collections.

```julia
abstract type Expression{T} end

struct Constant{T} <: Expression{T}
    value::T
end

struct Sum{T} <: Expression{T}
    terms::Vector{Expression{T}}
end
```

Here, we define a parametric type `Expression{T}` with two concrete types: `Constant{T}` and `Sum{T}`. This setup allows for building expression trees where each node can be a constant or a sum of expressions.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### File System Hierarchies

The Composite Pattern is ideal for representing file system hierarchies, where directories can contain both files and other directories. This structure allows for operations like calculating total size, listing contents, or searching for files to be implemented uniformly across the hierarchy.

```julia
file1 = File("file1.txt", 100)
file2 = File("file2.txt", 200)
subdir = Directory("subdir", [file1, file2])
root = Directory("root", [subdir, File("file3.txt", 300)])

println("Total size: ", total_size(root))  # Output: Total size: 600
```

In this example, we create a simple file system hierarchy and calculate the total size using the `total_size` function.

#### Mathematical Expressions

Another common use case for the Composite Pattern is in building mathematical expression trees, which are useful for symbolic computations and evaluations.

```julia
function evaluate(expr::Expression{T}) where T
    if expr isa Constant
        return expr.value
    elseif expr isa Sum
        return sum(evaluate(term) for term in expr.terms)
    end
end

expr = Sum{Int}([Constant{Int}(5), Constant{Int}(10), Sum{Int}([Constant{Int}(3), Constant{Int}(2)])])
println("Expression value: ", evaluate(expr))  # Output: Expression value: 20
```

This example demonstrates how to build and evaluate a mathematical expression tree using the Composite Pattern.

### Visualizing the Composite Pattern

To better understand the Composite Pattern, let's visualize a simple file system hierarchy using a tree diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Root Directory] --> B[Subdirectory]
    A --> C[File3.txt]
    B --> D[File1.txt]
    B --> E[File2.txt]
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram represents a file system hierarchy with a root directory containing a subdirectory and a file. The subdirectory further contains two files.

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: The Composite Pattern is ideal when you need to represent part-whole hierarchies and want to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of performance implications when dealing with large hierarchies, as recursive operations can be costly.
- **Flexibility**: The pattern provides flexibility in adding new component types without altering existing code.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Similar Patterns**: The Composite Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern, but while both involve tree-like structures, the Decorator Pattern focuses on adding responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Unique Features in Julia**: Julia's multiple dispatch and parametric types make it particularly well-suited for implementing the Composite Pattern, allowing for flexible and efficient designs.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by modifying the structures and methods. For instance, try adding a new type of expression, such as a `Product`, to the mathematical expression tree and implement the corresponding evaluation logic.
