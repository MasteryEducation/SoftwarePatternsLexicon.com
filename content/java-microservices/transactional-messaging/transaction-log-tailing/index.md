## Transaction Log Tailing and Transactional Messaging

Microservices often need to publish messages as part of a database transaction to ensure data consistency and reliability. This guide covers two techniques that address this requirement: **Transaction Log Tailing** and **Transactional Messaging**.

### Transaction Log Tailing

#### Definition

Transaction Log Tailing involves reading database transaction logs to identify changes that need to be published as messages to other systems. This technique ensures messages are published reliably as it leverages the existing database transaction mechanics.

#### Intent

The primary intent of Transaction Log Tailing is to ensure that any modify operation in the database is captured and propagated accurately to other microservices through messaging systems.

#### Also Known As
- **CDC (Change Data Capture)**
- **Database Replication**

#### Key Features
- **Consistency**: Ensures data consistency by leveraging the database's transaction log.
- **Reliability**: Reduces chances of missing a change event.
- **Decoupling**: Allows for asynchronous processing of data changes.

#### Detailed Explanations

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DatabaseLog {
        +String logEntries
        +void tailLog()
    }

    class MessageBroker {
        +void sendMessage(String message)
    }

    class TailingService {
        DatabaseLog dbLog
        MessageBroker broker
        +void processLogEntries()
    }

    DatabaseLog --> TailingService
    MessageBroker --> TailingService

    class Diagram {
        Database --> Changes
    }
```

#### Code Example

```java
public class TransactionLogService {

    @Autowired
    private DatabaseLogExtractor logExtractor;

    @Autowired
    private MessagePublisher messagePublisher;

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 10000)
    public void tailLog() {
        List<LogEntry> logEntries = logExtractor.extractLogEntries();
        logEntries.forEach(entry -> {
            String message = createMessage(entry);
            messagePublisher.publish(message);
        });
    }

    private String createMessage(LogEntry entry) {
        // Format the message from log entry
    }
}

@Component
public class DatabaseLogExtractor {

    public List<LogEntry> extractLogEntries() {
        // Logic to extract log entries from the database
    }
}

@Component
public class MessagePublisher {

    @Autowired
    private MessageBroker broker;

    public void publish(String message) {
        // Publish message to broker
    }
}
```

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DB as Database
    participant T as TransactionLogService
    participant P as MessagePublisher
    participant B as MessageBroker

    DB-->>T: Fetch log entries
    T-->>T: Process log entries
    T-->>P: Create message
    P-->>B: Publish message
```

#### Benefits
- Aligns well with most existing databases.
- Allows backtracking and re-processing.
- Ensures strong consistency and reliability.

#### Trade-offs
- May add latency due to periodic log reading.
- Requires access to database internals or configuration.

#### When to Use
- When strong data consistency is crucial.
- For propagating data changes across services.
- When using databases that support transaction logging.

#### When Not to Use
- When dealing with highly time-sensitive operations.
- Databases that don't provide easy access to transaction logs.

#### Related Patterns
- **Event Sourcing**: Instead of capturing changes from logs, captures state changes as events.

### Transactional Messaging

#### Definition

Transactional Messaging ensures that messages publish as part of the same transaction as the database operation. This guarantees that either both actions complete successfully or neither does.

#### Intent

To achieve atomicity in distributed systems by ensuring message publication is consistent with database transactions.

#### Also Known As
- **Outbox Pattern**
- **Reliable Messaging**

#### Key Features
- **Atomicity**: Ensures operations on both sides of the transaction succeed or fail together.
- **Reliability**: Reduces chances of message loss or failure.
- **Consistency**: Provides strong data consistency guarantees.

#### Detailed Explanations

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Outbox {
        +String id
        +String message
    }

    class Database {
        +void save(Object obj)
        +void saveOutboxMessage(Outbox message)
    }

    class TransactionManager {
        Database db
        +void beginTransaction()
        +void commitTransaction()
        +void rollbackTransaction()
    }

    Database --> Outbox

    class Diagram {
        Outbox --> TransactionalConsistency
    }
```

#### Code Example

```java
@Service
public class TransactionalMessagingService {
    
    @Autowired
    private DatabaseService databaseService;

    @Autowired
    private OutboxRepository outboxRepository;

    @Autowired
    private MessageSender messageSender;

    @Transactional
    public void performActionAndSendMessage(Object data, String message) {
        databaseService.save(data);
        Outbox outboxMessage = new Outbox(message);
        outboxRepository.save(outboxMessage);
    }

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 10000)
    @Transactional
    public void processOutbox() {
        List<Outbox> messages = outboxRepository.findUnsentMessages();
        messages.forEach(message -> {
            messageSender.send(message);
            outboxRepository.markAsSent(message);
        });
    }
}

interface OutboxRepository extends JpaRepository<Outbox, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT o FROM Outbox o WHERE o.sent = false")
    List<Outbox> findUnsentMessages();
}

@Component
public class MessageSender {
    @Autowired
    private MessageBroker messageBroker;

    public void send(Outbox message) {
        // Publish message to message broker
    }
}
```

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as TransactionalMessagingService
    participant D as DatabaseService
    participant O as OutboxRepository
    participant M as MessageBroker

    C->>S: performActionAndSendMessage()
    S->>D: save(data)
    S->>O: save(outboxMessage)
    S->>C: Success!

    S->>O: findUnsentMessages()
    O->>S: Return messages
    S->>M: Publish message
    S->>O: markAsSent(message)
```

#### Benefits
- Ensures atomicity of message publication.
- Strongly consistent messaging.
- Reliable, avoiding duplicated or missing messages.

#### Trade-offs
- Additional storage mechanism (Outbox table).
- Slight complexity in implementation.
- Requires periodic Outbox processing which can introduce latency.

#### When to Use
- Critical transactions requiring strong atomicity.
- Propagating state changes across microservices.
- When working with asynchronous messaging systems.

#### When Not to Use
- High-throughput systems where outbox processing overhead is unmanageable.

#### Related Patterns
- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**: Distributed transaction algorithm that coordinates all the processes participating in a transaction.
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction pattern for rolling back or compensating incomplete transactions in microservices.
