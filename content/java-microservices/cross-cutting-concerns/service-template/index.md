## Definition
The Service Template pattern offers a standardized template that implements common functionalities (cross-cutting concerns) for services, allowing developers to quickly start developing new services by copying the template.

## Intent
- To streamline the creation and onboarding of new services by providing a ready-to-use, standardized starting template.
- To consistently address cross-cutting concerns such as logging, monitoring, error handling, security, etc.

## Also Known As
- Service Blueprints
- Boilerplate Service Template

## Detailed Definitions and Explanations

### Key Features
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity across different services.
- **Standardization**: Standardizes the implementation of cross-cutting concerns.
- **Reusability**: Encourages code reuse.
- **Fast Setup**: Reduces the setup time for new services.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that tend to affect other parts of the system and include:
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Security
- Configuration
- Exception Handling
- Transaction Management

### Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractServiceTemplate {
        - Logger logger
        + generateId() : UUID
        + logMessage(String level, String message) : void
        + handleException(Exception e) : void
    }
    
    class ConcreteService extends AbstractServiceTemplate {
        + performServiceOperation()
    }

    AbstractServiceTemplate <|-- ConcreteService
```

### Explanation
- **AbstractServiceTemplate**: Implements the common functionalities that address cross-cutting concerns.
- **ConcreteService**: Inherits the template and adds service-specific operations.

### Code Example

```java
// AbstractServiceTemplate.java
import java.util.UUID;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public abstract class AbstractServiceTemplate {
    protected Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass());
    
    protected UUID generateId() {
        return UUID.randomUUID();
    }
    
    protected void logMessage(String level, String message) {
        switch(level) {
            case "INFO":
                logger.info(message);
                break;
            case "ERROR":
                logger.error(message);
                break;
            default:
                logger.debug(message);
                break;
        }
    }

    protected void handleException(Exception e) {
        logger.error("Exception occurred: ", e);
    }
}
```

### Concrete Example

```java
// ConcreteService.java
public class ConcreteService extends AbstractServiceTemplate {

    public void performServiceOperation() {
        try {
            UUID id = generateId();
            logMessage("INFO", "Operation started with ID: " + id);
            // Service specific code
            logMessage("INFO", "Operation succeeded with ID: " + id);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            handleException(e);
        }
    }
}
```

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ConcreteService
    participant AbstractServiceTemplate
    
    Client ->> ConcreteService: performServiceOperation()
    ConcreteService ->> AbstractServiceTemplate: generateId()
    AbstractServiceTemplate -->> ConcreteService: id
    ConcreteService ->> AbstractServiceTemplate: logMessage("INFO", "Operation started with ID: <id>")
    ConcreteService ->> ConcreteService: Perform specific operations
    ConcreteService ->> AbstractServiceTemplate: logMessage("INFO", "Operation succeeded with ID: <id>")
```

### Benefits
- **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Spares developers from writing repetitive code.
- **Uniformity**: Ensures a consistent approach to handling cross-cutting concerns.
- **Rapid Onboarding**: Speeds up setting up new services.
- **Improved Maintenance**: Makes the system easier to maintain.

### Trade-offs
- **Overhead**: Might introduce some performance overhead due to additional abstractions.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn and understand the template thoroughly.
- **Inflexibility**: It might be rigid in scenarios needing unique customizations.

### When to Use
- When you want to speed up the set-up of new microservices.
- When standardizing the implementation of cross-cutting concerns is necessary.

### Example Use Cases
- Rapidly growing organizations where new services are a regular necessity.
- Applications where consistency in logging, monitoring, and security is mandatory.

### When Not to Use
- For very unique services that don’t align with the standardized approaches.
- When performance overheads are not acceptable.

### Anti-patterns
- **Ignoring** customization needs that certain services may have.
- **Overloading** the template with too many generalized functionalities.

### Related Design Patterns
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Handles cross-cutting concerns via aspects.
- **Microservices Chassis**: Combines multiple cross-cutting concerns into a single framework.
