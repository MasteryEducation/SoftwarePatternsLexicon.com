## 3rd Party Registration

### Definition
3rd Party Registration is a pattern where a third-party service registers itself with a service registry.

### Intent
To enable service instances to register themselves with a central service registry, making them available to be discovered by other services.

### Also Known As
- Service Registry Registration
- Self-Registration

### Detailed Definition and Explanations
In microservices architecture, each service instance must be discoverable by other services. This enables interservice communication and collaboration. The 3rd Party Registration pattern allows a service to register its existence, network location, and other metadata with a service registry like Consul, Zookeeper, or Eureka.

### Key Features
- **Automated registration:** Services register automatically upon initialization.
- **Decentralization:** Service instances handle their own registration and removal.
- **Health checks:** Ensure that only healthy instances appear in the registry.

### Code Example

#### Spring Boot Setup with Eureka
```java
// pom.xml Dependencies
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>

// Application class
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}

// application.yml configuration
eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: true
    fetch-registry: true
  instance:
    hostname: ${HOSTNAME}
```

### Example Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ServiceInstance {
        +String hostname
        +int port
        +register()
    }
    
    class ServiceRegistry {
        +Map instances
        +registerInstance(ServiceInstance instance)
        +deregisterInstance(ServiceInstance instance)
    }

    ServiceInstance --|> ServiceRegistry
    ServiceInstance : +register()
    ServiceRegistry : +registerInstance(ServiceInstance)
```

### Explanation
The `ServiceInstance` class has a `register()` method to register itself with the `ServiceRegistry` which holds a map of all registered service instances.

### Benefits
- **Decentralized management:** Empowers services to manage their own presence in the registry.
- **Dynamic scaling:** Automatically accommodate new instances without manual intervention.

### Trade-Offs
- **Complexity:** Additional setup for initial registration logic in services.
- **Dependency:** Service registry becomes a single point of failure if not managed properly.

### When to Use
- When services need to be dynamically discovered by other services.
- In environments where services can scale dynamically, like Kubernetes or cloud platforms.

### Example Use Cases
- Microservices infrastructures where services need to discover each other.
- Scenarios requiring automated and scalable service management.

### When Not to Use and Anti-Patterns
- Do not use if services will never need dynamic discovery or if they have static endpoints.
- Antipattern: Static lists of service endpoints hardcoded into service configurations.

### Related Design Patterns
- **Service Discovery:** How clients discover network locations of registered services.
- **Self-Registration:** Where service instances self-register with the registry.

## Service Discovery

### Definition
Service Discovery is a pattern that allows clients to find the network location of service instances dynamically.

### Intent
To enable clients to locate service instances by querying a service registry, facilitating smooth interservice communication.

### Also Known As
- Service Lookup
- Dynamic Service Resolution

### Detailed Definition and Explanations
As the number of service instances changes due to scaling, updates, or failures, clients need a reliable way to find the active instances. Service Discovery allows them to query a service registry, ensuring they always have the current network location of available services.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic resolution:** Clients can find the current network location of a service instance.
- **Load balancing:** Integrates with client-side load-balancing mechanisms to distribute loads.

### Code Example

#### Spring Boot Client with Eureka
```java
// pom.xml Dependencies
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>

// Application class
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class ClientApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ClientApplication.class, args);
    }
}

// Rest Client Example
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/client")
public class ClientController {
    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;
    
    @GetMapping("/callService")
    public String callService() {
        return restTemplate.getForObject("http://SERVICE-NAME/endpoint", String.class);
    }
}

// Configuration file
@Bean
@LoadBalanced
public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
}
```

### Example Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ServiceRegistry
    participant ServiceInstance
    
    Client->>ServiceRegistry: Request service instance
    ServiceRegistry-->>Client: Response with service instance address
    Client->>ServiceInstance: Call service instance
    ServiceInstance-->>Client: Response
```

### Explanation
The diagram above shows the client querying the service registry to get a service's network address and then calling the service instance directly.

### Benefits
- **Flexibility:** Supports dynamic environment changes without reconfiguring clients.
- **Scalability:** More resilient to scale and changes in the services landscape.

### Trade-Offs
- **Registry dependency:** Consistent network performance relies on the availability and performance of the service registry.
- **Increased latency:** Extra step of querying the registry can introduce slight delays.

### When to Use
- For RPC-based service calls where service instances change dynamically.
- In environments requiring auto-scaling and robust service communication.

### Example Use Cases
- Discovery of microservices by clients in a cloud platform.
- Scenarios requiring dynamic coloring of services for deployment strategies.

### When Not to Use and Anti-Patterns
- In monolithic applications where all services are co-located.
- Antipattern: Directly hardcoding the URIs of services in clients.

### Related Design Patterns
- **3rd Party Registration:** Ensures services are available in the registry to be discovered.
- **API Gateway:** Routes and load balances requests among instances using service discovery.

## Grouping Patterns Solving Service Discovery
```mermaid
graph TD
  Service[Service]
  ServiceRegistry[Service Registry]
  LoadBalancer[Load Balancer]
  
  Service -->|self-register| ServiceRegistry
  ServiceRegistry -->|provides instances| Service
  ServiceRegistry -->|provides instances| LoadBalancer
  LoadBalancer -->|distributes traffic| Service
```

### Description
Grouping related patterns such as 3rd Party Registration and Service Discovery resolve issues of service availability and interservice communication in a microservices architecture. Service instances register themselves, and clients perform service discovery efficiently using a robust load balancing mechanism.
