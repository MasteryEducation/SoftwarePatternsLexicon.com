## Definition 
The *Multiple Service Instances per Host* pattern involves deploying multiple service instances on a single host machine. A host machine can be a physical server or a virtual machine, and multiple containers or application processes are executed on it.

## Intent
The intent behind this pattern is to efficiently utilize resources, simplify deployment, and manage resources more effectively by co-locating services on a single host.

## Also Known As
- Co-located Services
- Service Collocation

## Detailed Definitions and Explanations
This pattern is vital when you need to maximize resource usage and manage multiple service instances with minimal overhead. Instead of deploying each service instance on a separate host, you can bundle them on one host to save costs and simplify management.

## Key Features
- **Resource Efficiency**: Maximizes usage of CPU, memory, and storage.
- **Simplified Management**: Fewer hosts to manage compared to one host per service instance.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces infrastructure and operational costs.
- **Improved Performance**: Decreased latency as services are closer on the same host.

## Code Example
### Docker Compose Example
Using Docker Compose to deploy multiple services on a single host.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  service1:
    image: my-service1-image
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"

  service2:
    image: my-service2-image
    ports:
      - "8082:8080"
```

### Java Spring Boot Services
#### Service 1
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Service1Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Service1Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

#### Service 2
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Service2Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Service2Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

## Example Class Diagram with Explanation
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Host {
        +CPU : int
        +Memory : int
        +Storage : int
    }
    class Service1 {
        +port : int
    }
    class Service2 {
        +port : int
    }

    Host "1" *-- "0..*" Service1
    Host "1" *-- "0..*" Service2
```
### Explanation:
This class diagram shows that a single `Host` can have multiple instances of `Service1` and `Service2`.

## Example Sequence Diagram with Explanation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Host
    participant Service1
    participant Service2

    Client->>+Host: Request to Service 1
    Host->>+Service1: Forward request
    Service1->>-Host: Response
    Host->>-Client: Response

    Client->>+Host: Request to Service 2
    Host->>+Service2: Forward request
    Service2->>-Host: Response
    Host->>-Client: Response
```

### Explanation:
This sequence diagram illustrates how a `Client` requests services from multiple `Service` instances co-located on a single `Host`.

## Benefits
- **Resource Utilization**: Better use of available resources.
- **Reduced Costs**: Lower infrastructure and maintenance costs.
- **Simplified Network Setup**: Services on the same host communicate faster.

## Trade-offs
- **Resource Competition**: Services might compete for resources on the same host.
- **Management Complexity**: Despite fewer hosts, managing multiple services requires monitoring tools.
- **Security Risks**: Fault isolation might be harder; a compromised service could affect others on the same host.

## When to Use
- When you need to maximize the utilization of server resources.
- To reduce costs for deployment and maintenance.
- For environments where deploying individual hosts for each service is unnecessary.

## Example Use Cases
- DevOps and CI/CD environments to run multiple services for automated testing.
- Local development environments to replicate production setup at low cost.
- Applications with low to moderate resource demands.

## When Not to Use and Anti-patterns
- For services with high resource demand where shared resources might cause latency.
- When strict isolation between services is required.
- Avoid deploying critical services together where a single compromise can take down multiple services.

## Related Design Patterns with Descriptions and Comparisons
- **Single Service Instance per Host**: Deploying a single service per host provides better isolation.
- **Service Instance per VM or Container**: Uses lightweight containers for isolation, balancing between resource usage and security.
