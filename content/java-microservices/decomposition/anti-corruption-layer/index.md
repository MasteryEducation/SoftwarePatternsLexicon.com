## Definition
The Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) pattern helps to isolate legacy systems and protect new systems from unintended side effects caused by outdated or incompatible system changes. It acts as a shield ensuring that the new system communicates with legacy systems without getting "polluted" by their complexities or inconsistencies.

## Intent
To create a layer that translates requests and responses between a modern microservices application and a legacy system, facilitating integration while protecting the new application from the legacy system's design issues or technical debts.

## Also Known As
- Boundary Layer
- Adapter Pattern

## Detailed Explanation
The ACL essentially works as a translator or adapter that sits between the microservices and the legacy system. It ensures that the modern system only interacts through the clean, well-defined interfaces of the ACL, thus keeping the new system "clean." 

### Key Features
- **Isolation**: Protects the microservices architecture from the internal complexity and possibly poor design of the legacy system.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples the new system's implementation details from the legacy system.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the communication between different systems.
- **Transformation**: Converts data and requests to formats acceptable by both systems.

## Code Example

```java
// Assume `LegacySystemService` is a class that represents a legacy system's API.

@Data
class LegacyData {
    private String legacyField1;
    private int legacyField2;
}

@Data
class ModernData {
    private String modernField1;
    private int modernField2;
}

interface LegacySystemService {
    LegacyData getLegacyData();
    void sendLegacyData(LegacyData data);
}

class AntiCorruptionLayer {
    private final LegacySystemService legacySystemService;

    public AntiCorruptionLayer(LegacySystemService legacySystemService) {
        this.legacySystemService = legacySystemService;
    }

    public ModernData getModernData() {
        LegacyData legacyData = legacySystemService.getLegacyData();
        return transformToModern(legacyData);
    }

    public void sendModernData(ModernData data) {
        LegacyData legacyData = transformToLegacy(data);
        legacySystemService.sendLegacyData(legacyData);
    }

    private ModernData transformToModern(LegacyData legacyData) {
        ModernData modernData = new ModernData();
        modernData.setModernField1(legacyData.getLegacyField1());
        modernData.setModernField2(legacyData.getLegacyField2());
        return modernData;
    }

    private LegacyData transformToLegacy(ModernData modernData) {
        LegacyData legacyData = new LegacyData();
        legacyData.setLegacyField1(modernData.getModernField1());
        legacyData.setLegacyField2(modernData.getModernField2());
        return legacyData;
    }
}
```

### Example Class Diagram

```mermaid

    class LegacySystemService {
        +getLegacyData() LegacyData
        +sendLegacyData(data LegacyData)
    }
    
    class AntiCorruptionLayer {
        -LegacySystemService legacySystemService
        +getModernData() ModernData
        +sendModernData(data ModernData)
        -transformToModern(LegacyData) ModernData
        -transformToLegacy(ModernData) LegacyData
    }

    AntiCorruptionLayer *-- LegacySystemService
    LegacySystemService ..> LegacyData
    AntiCorruptionLayer ..> ModernData
    ModernData o.. Data
    LegacyData o.. Data

    class ModernData {
        +String modernField1
        +int modernField2
    }
    
    class LegacyData {
        +String legacyField1
        +int legacyField2
    }
```

### Example Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ModernService
    participant AntiCorruptionLayer
    participant LegacySystem
    ModernService->>AntiCorruptionLayer: requestModernData()
    AntiCorruptionLayer->>LegacySystem: getLegacyData()
    LegacySystem-->>AntiCorruptionLayer: return LegacyData
    AntiCorruptionLayer-->>ModernService: return transformToModern(LegacyData)
    ModernService->>AntiCorruptionLayer: sendModernData(ModernData)
    AntiCorruptionLayer->>LegacySystem: sendLegacyData(transformToLegacy(ModernData))
    LegacySystem-->>AntiCorruptionLayer: Data Processed
    AntiCorruptionLayer-->>ModernService: Ack

## Benefits
- Protects the new system from the outdated or poorly designed interfaces of a legacy system.
- Encourages the incremental migration of systems by isolating legacy code.
- Reduces the risk and complexity when integrating with legacy systems.
- Facilitates ongoing improvements and refactoring of the legacy system without affecting the new system.

## Trade-Offs
- Adds additional complexity to the new system due to the creation and maintenance of the ACL.
- May have performance overhead due to the overhead of transformation and translation.

## When to Use
- When integrating with legacy systems that have poorly designed interfaces or data structures.
- When you want to keep your microservices architecture clean and free from legacy issues.
- When migrating functionalities incrementally from legacy systems to new systems.

## Example Use Cases
- Modernizing a monolithic application by gradually extracting microservices.
- Integrating with a third-party system that has a complex API.
- Situations where the legacy system cannot be refactored or only incrementally updated.

## When Not to Use
- If the legacy system is simple and changes infrequently.
- When the overheads of implementing and maintaining the ACL outweigh the benefits.
- In cases where the integration can be handled via simpler adapter patterns.

## Anti-Patterns
- Directly exposing the legacy system's complex and inefficient APIs to new client applications.
- Creating monolithic ACLs that become a bottleneck or single point of failure.
- Tight coupling between the ACL and the new system's core services.

## Related Design Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: Usually used for simple adaptations, ACLs are more complex, encompassing transformations and business logic.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem; ACL also transforms data structures and commands.
- **Gateway Pattern**: Provides a way for the microservices to access external services. ACL extends this by incorporating data translation.
