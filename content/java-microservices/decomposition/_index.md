## Decomposing an Application into Services

## Definition
Decomposing an application into services involves breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, well-defined, cohesive, and loosely-coupled services that each handle a specific part of the application's functionality.

## Also Known As
- Service decomposition
- Microservice splitting
- Microservice segmentation

## Detailed Explanation
Decomposing into services aims to enhance modularity, making applications easier to manage, scale, and evolve. Effective decomposition involves identifying boundaries, modules, and responsibilities that can become discrete services.

### Patterns for Decomposition

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- Using bounded contexts to define service boundaries and ensure services align with business domains.
- Example:
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        Domain -->|Part| BoundedContext1
        Domain -->|Aux| BoundedContext2
        BoundedContext1 -->|Activity| Service1
        BoundedContext1 -->|Business| Service2
        BoundedContext2 -->|Line| Service3
        BoundedContext2 -->|2ndAct| Service4
    ```

2. **Business Capability**
- Decomposing services along business capabilities ensures that services encapsulate a distinct piece of business functionality.
- Example Entities: InventoryService, OrderService, PaymentService

3. **Subdomains**
- Deconstructing by subdomains where each subdomain encapsulates closely related tasks and commands.
- Example Entities: Shopping Cart Service, Customer Profile Service.

4. **Event-Storming**
- Using event-storming sessions to identify domain events that pinpoint integral components that can form services.
6. **Strangler Fig Pattern**
- Incrementally extracting services by replacing parts of a monolithic application with microservices.
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Monolithic Application]
        A-->B[Extracted Service 1]
        B-->C[Strangler Fig Proxy]
        A-->C
        C-->D[Client]
        subgraph EdgeProxy
            C
        end
        subgraph Monolithic
            A
        end
    ```

### Example Use Cases
- Large applications needing scaling and better modular structure.
- Systems facing operational bottlenecks in a monolithic setup.
- Application modernization initiatives.

### When Not to Use
- Small and simple applications.
- Teams without DevOps capabilities to manage multiple services.

## Trade-Offs
- Increased complexity in inter-service communication.
- Additional overhead due to multiple deployments, monitoring, and increased network latency.

## Related Patterns
- **Service Mesh**: Handles inter-service communication.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized request routing.
- **Saga**: Manages distributed transaction consistency.

# Patterns Tackling Service Communication

## Overview

Effective service-to-service communication is essential for achieving the benefits of a microservices architecture, such as scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance. The following patterns address key aspects of service communication:

### Patterns Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    S1[Service Communication Patterns]
    S1 -->|Synchronous| S2[Circuit Breaker Pattern]
    S1 -->|Uses| S3[Hystrix]
    S1 -->|Boundaries| S4[API Gateway]
    S1 -->|State| SE[Saga Pattern]
    S1 -->|Consistency| SC[Event Sourcing]
    S1 -->|Data| SYB[Database per Service]
    S2 -->|Fault Tolerance| CBD[Circuit Breaker Database]
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

- **Definition**: Helps prevent repeated access to a failing service, thereby preserving system stability.
- **Use Cases**: Services encountering temporal slowdowns.
- **Related Patterns**: Fallback Service.

### Hystrix

- **Definition**: Library focusing on latency tolerance and fault tolerance using Circuit Breaker.
- **Use Cases**: Services prone to failures and requiring fallback strategies.
- **Related Patterns**: Circuit Breaker.

### API Gateway

- **Definition**: Entry point to mask internal service topology.
- **Use Cases**: Centralized API control and service discovery.
- **Related Patterns**: Edge Service, Load Balancer.

### Saga Pattern

- **Definition**: Orchestration based pattern ensuring distributed data consistency.
- **Use Cases**: Distributed transactions scenarios.
- **Related Patterns**: Orchestration, State Machine.

### Event Sourcing

- **Definition**: Ensures consistency by storing sequence events to reconstruct state.
- **Use Cases**: Audit logging, Event reconstruction.
- **Related Patterns**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

### Database per Service

- **Definition**: Each service keeps its own database for data management.
- **Use Cases**: Service-specific schema needs.
- **Related Patterns**: Shared Database, CQRS.

## Conclusion
Understanding various service communication patterns and effectively implementing them can significantly improve the robustness and maintainability of microservices architecture.
