## 13.9 Reprocessing and Replay Patterns

Reprocessing and replay patterns in Apache Kafka are crucial for maintaining fault tolerance and reliability in distributed systems. These patterns enable systems to recover from processing errors, apply new logic to historical data, or populate new systems. This section delves into the reasons for reprocessing messages, techniques for replaying messages safely, and provides examples of implementing reprocessing workflows. Additionally, it discusses considerations for data consistency and system load.

### Intent

- **Description**: Reprocessing and replay patterns are designed to handle scenarios where messages need to be reprocessed due to errors, changes in business logic, or system migrations. These patterns ensure that systems can recover gracefully and maintain data integrity.

### Motivation

- **Explanation**: In distributed systems, processing errors, logic changes, or the need to populate new systems often necessitate reprocessing messages. Kafka's architecture supports these needs by allowing messages to be replayed from topics, enabling systems to handle such scenarios effectively.

### Applicability

- **Guidelines**: Reprocessing and replay patterns are applicable in scenarios where:
  - Processing errors have occurred, and messages need to be reprocessed.
  - Business logic has changed, requiring historical data to be re-evaluated.
  - New systems need to be populated with historical data.
  - Data consistency and integrity must be maintained across distributed systems.

### Structure

- **Diagram**:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
        A[Producer] -->|Publish Messages| B[Kafka Topic];
        B -->|Consume Messages| C[Consumer];
        C -->|Process Messages| D[Processing Logic];
        D -->|Store Results| E[Data Store];
        E -->|Detect Error/Change| F[Reprocessing Trigger];
        F -->|Replay Messages| B;
    ```

- **Caption**: This diagram illustrates the flow of messages from producers to consumers, through processing logic, and into a data store. It also shows how reprocessing triggers can replay messages from the Kafka topic.

### Participants

- **Producer**: Publishes messages to Kafka topics.
- **Kafka Topic**: Stores messages for consumption and replay.
- **Consumer**: Consumes messages from Kafka topics for processing.
- **Processing Logic**: Applies business logic to consumed messages.
- **Data Store**: Stores processed results.
- **Reprocessing Trigger**: Initiates message replay based on errors or changes.

### Collaborations

- **Interactions**: Producers publish messages to Kafka topics, which are consumed by consumers. Processing logic is applied, and results are stored in a data store. Reprocessing triggers can replay messages from the Kafka topic when necessary.

### Consequences

- **Analysis**: Reprocessing and replay patterns provide fault tolerance and reliability by allowing systems to recover from errors and apply new logic to historical data. However, they can increase system load and require careful management of data consistency.

### Implementation

#### Sample Code Snippets

- **Java**:

    ```java
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
    import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer;

    import java.util.Collections;
    import java.util.Properties;

    public class ReplayConsumer {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "replay-group");
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, "earliest");

            KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
            consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));

            while (true) {
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                    // Process each record
                    System.out.printf("Offset = %d, Key = %s, Value = %s%n", record.offset(), record.key(), record.value());
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- **Scala**:

    ```scala
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.{ConsumerConfig, KafkaConsumer}
    import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
    import java.util.Properties
    import scala.collection.JavaConverters._

    object ReplayConsumer {
      def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        val props = new Properties()
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092")
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "replay-group")
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, classOf[StringDeserializer].getName)
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, classOf[StringDeserializer].getName)
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, "earliest")

        val consumer = new KafkaConsumer[String, String](props)
        consumer.subscribe(List("my-topic").asJava)

        while (true) {
          val records = consumer.poll(100).asScala
          for (record <- records) {
            // Process each record
            println(s"Offset = ${record.offset()}, Key = ${record.key()}, Value = ${record.value()}")
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Kotlin**:

    ```kotlin
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer
    import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
    import java.util.*

    fun main() {
        val props = Properties().apply {
            put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092")
            put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "replay-group")
            put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer::class.java.name)
            put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer::class.java.name)
            put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, "earliest")
        }

        val consumer = KafkaConsumer<String, String>(props)
        consumer.subscribe(listOf("my-topic"))

        while (true) {
            val records = consumer.poll(100)
            for (record in records) {
                // Process each record
                println("Offset = ${record.offset()}, Key = ${record.key()}, Value = ${record.value()}")
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- **Clojure**:

    ```clojure
    (ns replay-consumer
      (:import [org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer KafkaConsumer ConsumerConfig]
               [org.apache.kafka.common.serialization StringDeserializer])
      (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]))

    (defn create-consumer []
      (let [props (doto (java.util.Properties.)
                    (.put ConsumerConfig/BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG "localhost:9092")
                    (.put ConsumerConfig/GROUP_ID_CONFIG "replay-group")
                    (.put ConsumerConfig/KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG StringDeserializer)
                    (.put ConsumerConfig/VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG StringDeserializer)
                    (.put ConsumerConfig/AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG "earliest"))]
        (KafkaConsumer. props)))

    (defn -main []
      (let [consumer (create-consumer)]
        (.subscribe consumer ["my-topic"])
        (while true
          (let [records (.poll consumer 100)]
            (doseq [record records]
              ;; Process each record
              (println (format "Offset = %d, Key = %s, Value = %s"
                               (.offset record) (.key record) (.value record))))))))
    ```

- **Explanation**: These code examples demonstrate how to implement a replay consumer in various languages. The consumer subscribes to a Kafka topic and processes messages from the beginning of the topic, allowing for reprocessing of historical data.

### Sample Use Cases

- **Real-world Scenarios**: 
  - **Error Recovery**: Reprocessing messages after a processing error to ensure data consistency.
  - **Logic Changes**: Replaying messages to apply new business logic to historical data.
  - **System Migration**: Populating a new system with historical data by replaying messages from Kafka topics.

### Related Patterns

- **Connections**: Reprocessing and replay patterns are related to [4.4 Reliable Data Delivery Patterns]({{< ref "/kafka/4/4" >}} "Reliable Data Delivery Patterns") and [13.4 Ensuring Message Delivery Guarantees]({{< ref "/kafka/13/4" >}} "Ensuring Message Delivery Guarantees"), as they all focus on ensuring data integrity and reliability in distributed systems.

### Considerations for Data Consistency and System Load

- **Data Consistency**: Ensure that reprocessing does not lead to data duplication or inconsistency. Use idempotent operations where possible.
- **System Load**: Reprocessing can increase system load. Consider scheduling reprocessing during off-peak hours or using throttling mechanisms to manage load.
