**Example Code: MQTT to Kafka Integration**

- **Java**:

    ```java
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
    import org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.*;

    public class MqttToKafkaBridge {
        private static final String MQTT_BROKER = "tcp://localhost:1883";
        private static final String KAFKA_TOPIC = "iot-data";
        private static final String KAFKA_BROKER = "localhost:9092";

        public static void main(String[] args) throws MqttException {
            MqttClient mqttClient = new MqttClient(MQTT_BROKER, MqttClient.generateClientId());
            mqttClient.connect();
            mqttClient.subscribe("sensor/temperature", (topic, message) -> {
                String payload = new String(message.getPayload());
                KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(getKafkaProperties());
                producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(KAFKA_TOPIC, payload));
                producer.close();
            });
        }

        private static Properties getKafkaProperties() {
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.put("bootstrap.servers", KAFKA_BROKER);
            props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
            props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
            return props;
        }
    }
    ```

    object MqttToKafkaBridge extends App {
      val mqttBroker = "tcp://localhost:1883"
      val kafkaTopic = "iot-data"
      val kafkaBroker = "localhost:9092"

      val mqttClient = new MqttClient(mqttBroker, MqttClient.generateClientId())
      mqttClient.connect()
      mqttClient.subscribe("sensor/temperature", (topic: String, message: MqttMessage) => {
        val payload = new String(message.getPayload)
        val producer = new KafkaProducer[String, String](getKafkaProperties)
        producer.send(new ProducerRecord[String, String](kafkaTopic, payload))
        producer.close()
      })

      def getKafkaProperties: java.util.Properties = {
        val props = new java.util.Properties()
        props.put("bootstrap.servers", kafkaBroker)
        props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer")
        props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer")

                              producer (KafkaProducer. (get-kafka-properties))]
                          (.send producer (ProducerRecord. kafka-topic payload))
                          (.close producer)))))))
    ```

### Best Practices for Securing IoT Data Streams

Securing IoT data streams is critical to protect sensitive information and ensure data integrity. Here are some best practices:

- **Encryption**: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between IoT devices and Kafka brokers.
- **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or SASL, to verify the identity of devices and users.
- **Access Control**: Use Kafka's Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive topics and data.
- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize sensitive data before processing to protect user privacy.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Continuously monitor data streams for anomalies and audit access logs to detect unauthorized access.

### Visualizing IoT Data Processing with Kafka
