## 5.2 Consumer API Deep Dive

The Kafka Consumer API is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and efficient data processing applications. This section delves into the advanced aspects of the Kafka Consumer API, providing expert insights into custom deserializers, manual offset management, commit strategies, and handling partition rebalances with listeners. By mastering these techniques, you can optimize your Kafka consumers for complex real-world scenarios.

### Understanding the Kafka Consumer API

The Kafka Consumer API is designed to allow applications to read streams of data from Kafka topics. It provides a high-level abstraction for consuming messages, managing offsets, and handling partition assignments. Understanding the structure and flow of the Kafka Consumer API is crucial for implementing advanced consumer patterns.

#### Key Concepts

- **Consumer Group**: A group of consumers that work together to consume messages from a set of topics. Each partition in a topic is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group.
- **Offset**: A unique identifier for each message within a partition. Consumers track offsets to know which messages have been processed.
- **Rebalance**: The process of redistributing partitions among consumers in a group when there is a change in the group (e.g., a consumer joins or leaves).

### Implementing Custom Deserializers

Kafka consumers use deserializers to convert byte arrays into Java objects. While Kafka provides default deserializers for common data types, you may need to implement custom deserializers for complex data formats.

#### Custom Deserializer Example

Let's implement a custom deserializer for a JSON object using Java:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class CustomJsonDeserializer<T> implements Deserializer<T> {
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
    private Class<T> targetType;

    public CustomJsonDeserializer(Class<T> targetType) {
        this.targetType = targetType;
    }

    @Override
    public T deserialize(String topic, byte[] data) {
        try {
            return objectMapper.readValue(data, targetType);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to deserialize JSON", e);
        }
    }
}
```

**Scala Example**:

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper

class CustomJsonDeserializer[T](targetType: Class[T]) extends Deserializer[T] {
  private val objectMapper = new ObjectMapper()

  override def deserialize(topic: String, data: Array[Byte]): T = {
    try {
      objectMapper.readValue(data, targetType)
    } catch {
      case e: Exception => throw new RuntimeException("Failed to deserialize JSON", e)
    }
  }
}
```

**Kotlin Example**:

```kotlin
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper

class CustomJsonDeserializer<T>(private val targetType: Class<T>) : Deserializer<T> {
    private val objectMapper = ObjectMapper()

    override fun deserialize(topic: String, data: ByteArray): T {
        return try {
            objectMapper.readValue(data, targetType)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            throw RuntimeException("Failed to deserialize JSON", e)
        }
    }
}
```

**Clojure Example**:

```clojure
(ns custom-deserializer
  (:import [org.apache.kafka.common.serialization Deserializer]
           [com.fasterxml.jackson.databind ObjectMapper]))

(defn custom-json-deserializer [target-type]
  (reify Deserializer
    (deserialize [_ _ data]
      (try
        (.readValue (ObjectMapper.) data target-type)
        (catch Exception e
          (throw (RuntimeException. "Failed to deserialize JSON" e)))))))
```

### Manual Offset Control

By default, Kafka automatically commits offsets periodically. However, there are scenarios where manual offset control is necessary, such as when processing messages involves complex logic or external systems.

#### When to Use Manual Offset Control

- **Error Handling**: If processing a message fails, you may want to retry without committing the offset.
- **Batch Processing**: Commit offsets only after a batch of messages is processed successfully.
- **Transactional Processing**: Ensure that offsets are committed only after a transaction is completed.

#### Implementing Manual Offset Control

In Java, you can manage offsets manually using the `commitSync` and `commitAsync` methods:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;

public void consumeWithManualOffsetControl(Consumer<String, String> consumer) {
    try {
        while (true) {
            ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
            for (var record : records) {
                // Process record
            }
            consumer.commitSync(); // Commit offsets synchronously
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions
    } finally {
        consumer.close();
    }
}
```

**Scala Example**:

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.{ConsumerRecords, KafkaConsumer}

def consumeWithManualOffsetControl(consumer: KafkaConsumer[String, String]): Unit = {
  try {
    while (true) {
      val records: ConsumerRecords[String, String] = consumer.poll(java.time.Duration.ofMillis(100))
      records.forEach { record =>
        // Process record
      }
      consumer.commitSync() // Commit offsets synchronously
    }
  } catch {
    case e: Exception => // Handle exceptions
  } finally {
    consumer.close()
  }
}
```

### Commit Strategies

Kafka provides different commit strategies to manage offsets, each with its own use cases and trade-offs.

#### Auto Commit

- **Description**: Offsets are committed automatically at a regular interval.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for simple applications where message processing is quick and reliable.
- **Trade-offs**: May lead to message duplication or data loss if a consumer crashes before committing.

#### Manual Commit

- **Description**: Offsets are committed manually by the application.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications requiring precise control over message processing and offset management.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires more complex logic and error handling.

#### Commit Strategies Comparison

| Strategy      | Use Case                          | Pros                          | Cons                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Auto Commit   | Simple, fast processing           | Easy to implement             | Risk of duplication or loss   |
| Manual Commit | Complex, transactional processing | Precise control over offsets  | More complex implementation   |

### Handling Partition Rebalances with Listeners

Partition rebalancing occurs when the membership of a consumer group changes. Handling rebalances effectively is crucial to ensure data consistency and minimize downtime.

#### Implementing Rebalance Listeners

Kafka provides a `ConsumerRebalanceListener` interface to handle partition rebalances:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRebalanceListener;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer;
import org.apache.kafka.common.TopicPartition;

public class CustomRebalanceListener implements ConsumerRebalanceListener {
    private final Consumer<String, String> consumer;

    public CustomRebalanceListener(Consumer<String, String> consumer) {
        this.consumer = consumer;
    }

    @Override
    public void onPartitionsRevoked(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
        // Commit offsets before rebalance
        consumer.commitSync();
    }

    @Override
    public void onPartitionsAssigned(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
        // Seek to the last committed offset
        for (TopicPartition partition : partitions) {
            consumer.seek(partition, consumer.position(partition));
        }
    }
}
```

**Scala Example**:

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.{Consumer, ConsumerRebalanceListener}
import org.apache.kafka.common.TopicPartition

class CustomRebalanceListener(consumer: Consumer[String, String]) extends ConsumerRebalanceListener {
  override def onPartitionsRevoked(partitions: java.util.Collection[TopicPartition]): Unit = {
    // Commit offsets before rebalance
    consumer.commitSync()
  }

  override def onPartitionsAssigned(partitions: java.util.Collection[TopicPartition]): Unit = {
    // Seek to the last committed offset
    partitions.forEach { partition =>
      consumer.seek(partition, consumer.position(partition))
    }
  }
}
```
