## 5.3.6 Interactive Queries and State Stores

### Introduction

Interactive queries in Kafka Streams represent a powerful feature that allows applications to expose the state of stream processing in real-time. This capability enables external access to state stores, facilitating use cases such as dashboards, real-time analytics, and APIs. In this section, we will delve into the concept of interactive queries, how to enable and configure them, and provide practical examples of accessing state stores externally. We will also discuss considerations for scaling and load management, ensuring that your applications remain robust and efficient.

### Understanding Interactive Queries

Interactive queries allow you to query the state of your Kafka Streams application directly, without needing to produce the state to an external system. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require real-time insights or need to expose their state to other services or users. By leveraging interactive queries, you can build applications that are not only reactive but also provide immediate feedback based on the current state of the data.

#### Key Concepts

- **State Stores**: These are the storage mechanisms within Kafka Streams that hold the state of your application. They can be in-memory or persistent, depending on your configuration and requirements.
- **Queryable State**: This refers to the ability to access the state stored in state stores through interactive queries.
- **Interactive Queries**: These are the queries that you perform on the state stores to retrieve the current state of your application.

### Enabling and Configuring Interactive Queries

To enable interactive queries in your Kafka Streams application, you need to configure your state stores to be queryable. This involves setting up the state stores and ensuring that your application is capable of handling query requests.

#### Step-by-Step Configuration

1. **Define State Stores**: Use the Kafka Streams API to define the state stores you need. You can choose between in-memory or persistent stores based on your application's requirements.

2. **Enable Queryable State**: Configure your state stores to be queryable by setting the appropriate configuration parameters. This typically involves specifying the store name and ensuring that the store is registered with the Kafka Streams topology.

3. **Expose State Stores**: Implement a mechanism to expose the state stores to external systems. This could be through a REST API, a gRPC service, or another suitable interface.

4. **Handle Query Requests**: Ensure that your application can handle incoming query requests efficiently. This may involve optimizing your state stores for read-heavy workloads and implementing caching strategies to reduce latency.

#### Example Configuration

Below is an example of how to configure a queryable state store in a Kafka Streams application using Java:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.state.QueryableStoreTypes;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.state.ReadOnlyKeyValueStore;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.state.Stores;

public class InteractiveQueryExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

        // Define a state store
        builder.table("input-topic", Stores.keyValueStoreBuilder(
                Stores.persistentKeyValueStore("my-store"),
                Serdes.String(),
                Serdes.String()
        ));

        KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), getStreamsConfig());
        streams.start();

        // Access the state store
        ReadOnlyKeyValueStore<String, String> keyValueStore =
                streams.store("my-store", QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore());

        // Example query
        String value = keyValueStore.get("some-key");
        System.out.println("Value for 'some-key': " + value);
    }

    private static Properties getStreamsConfig() {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "interactive-query-example");
        props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        return props;
    }
}
```

### Accessing State Stores Externally

Once you have configured your state stores to be queryable, you can expose them to external systems. This is typically done through a REST API or a similar interface that allows other applications or users to query the state.

#### Example: Exposing State Stores via REST API

Here's an example of how you might expose a Kafka Streams state store using a simple REST API in Java:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class StateStoreController {

    private final KafkaStreams streams;

    public StateStoreController(KafkaStreams streams) {
        this.streams = streams;
    }

    @GetMapping("/state")
    public String getState(@RequestParam String key) {
        ReadOnlyKeyValueStore<String, String> store =
                streams.store("my-store", QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore());
        return store.get(key);
    }
}
```

### Use Cases for Interactive Queries

Interactive queries open up a wide range of possibilities for real-time applications. Some common use cases include:

- **Dashboards**: Provide real-time insights and visualizations based on the current state of your data.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Perform on-the-fly analysis of streaming data without the need for batch processing.
- **APIs**: Expose the state of your Kafka Streams application to other services or users through a RESTful interface.

### Considerations for Scaling and Load Management

When implementing interactive queries, it's important to consider the impact on your application's performance and scalability. Here are some key considerations:

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute query requests evenly across your Kafka Streams instances to prevent any single instance from becoming a bottleneck.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce the load on your state stores and improve query response times.
- **Resource Management**: Monitor the resource usage of your Kafka Streams application and adjust your configuration as needed to ensure optimal performance.

### Code Examples Demonstrating Interactive Queries

To further illustrate the concept of interactive queries, let's look at some additional code examples in different programming languages.

#### Scala Example

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.streams.scala._
import org.apache.kafka.streams.scala.kstream._
import org.apache.kafka.streams.state.{QueryableStoreTypes, Stores}
import org.apache.kafka.streams.{KafkaStreams, StreamsConfig}

object InteractiveQueryExample extends App {

  val builder = new StreamsBuilder()

  // Define a state store
  builder.table[String, String]("input-topic", Materialized.as[String, String]("my-store"))

  val streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), getStreamsConfig)
  streams.start()

  // Access the state store
  val keyValueStore = streams.store("my-store", QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore[String, String]())

  // Example query
  val value = keyValueStore.get("some-key")
  println(s"Value for 'some-key': $value")

  def getStreamsConfig: Properties = {
    val props = new Properties()
    props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "interactive-query-example")
    props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092")
    props
  }
}
```

#### Kotlin Example

```kotlin
import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder
import org.apache.kafka.streams.state.QueryableStoreTypes
import org.apache.kafka.streams.state.Stores
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig
import java.util.Properties

fun main() {
    val builder = StreamsBuilder()

    // Define a state store
    builder.table<String, String>("input-topic", Stores.keyValueStoreBuilder(
        Stores.persistentKeyValueStore("my-store"),
        Serdes.String(),
        Serdes.String()
    ))

    val streams = KafkaStreams(builder.build(), getStreamsConfig())
    streams.start()

    // Access the state store
    val keyValueStore = streams.store("my-store", QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore<String, String>())

    // Example query
    val value = keyValueStore["some-key"]
    println("Value for 'some-key': $value")
}

fun getStreamsConfig(): Properties {
    val props = Properties()
    props[StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG] = "interactive-query-example"
    props[StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG] = "localhost:9092"
    return props
}
```

#### Clojure Example

```clojure
(ns interactive-query-example
  (:import [org.apache.kafka.streams KafkaStreams StreamsBuilder]
           [org.apache.kafka.streams.state QueryableStoreTypes Stores]
           [org.apache.kafka.streams StreamsConfig]
           [java.util Properties]))

(defn get-streams-config []
  (doto (Properties.)
    (.put StreamsConfig/APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG "interactive-query-example")
    (.put StreamsConfig/BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG "localhost:9092")))

(defn -main []
  (let [builder (StreamsBuilder.)]

    ;; Define a state store
    (.table builder "input-topic"
            (Stores/keyValueStoreBuilder
              (Stores/persistentKeyValueStore "my-store")
              (Serdes/String)
              (Serdes/String)))

    (let [streams (KafkaStreams. (.build builder) (get-streams-config))]
      (.start streams)

      ;; Access the state store
      (let [keyValueStore (.store streams "my-store" (QueryableStoreTypes/keyValueStore))]
        ;; Example query
        (println "Value for 'some-key':" (.get keyValueStore "some-key"))))))
```

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Optimize State Store Configuration**: Choose the right type of state store (in-memory vs. persistent) based on your application's needs. Persistent stores offer durability, while in-memory stores provide faster access times.
- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly monitor the performance of your Kafka Streams application, especially the state stores, to identify any potential bottlenecks.
- **Implement Security Measures**: Ensure that your interactive queries are secure, especially if you are exposing them to external systems. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect your data.

### Conclusion

Interactive queries in Kafka Streams provide a powerful mechanism for accessing the state of your stream processing applications in real-time. By enabling queryable state stores, you can build applications that offer immediate insights and integrate seamlessly with other systems. Whether you're building dashboards, real-time analytics platforms, or APIs, interactive queries can enhance the capabilities of your Kafka Streams applications.
