## 2.1.3.3 Migration Path to KRaft

### Introduction

The transition from ZooKeeper-based Kafka clusters to the KRaft (Kafka Raft) architecture represents a significant evolution in Kafka's design, aimed at simplifying cluster management and enhancing scalability. This section provides a detailed guide for expert software engineers and enterprise architects on migrating existing Kafka deployments to KRaft. We will explore the migration process, address compatibility issues, and offer best practices for testing and validation to ensure a smooth transition.

### Understanding the KRaft Architecture

Before diving into the migration process, it's essential to understand the [KRaft architecture]({{< ref "/kafka/2/1/3" >}} "KRaft Architecture"). KRaft eliminates the need for ZooKeeper by integrating metadata management directly into Kafka brokers. This change simplifies the architecture and reduces operational complexity.

### Migration Steps

#### 1. Assess Current Kafka Deployment

- **Inventory Existing Infrastructure**: Document the current Kafka cluster setup, including broker configurations, ZooKeeper ensemble, topics, partitions, and replication factors.
- **Evaluate Kafka Version**: Ensure the Kafka version supports KRaft. As of Kafka 2.8, KRaft is available, but production readiness is achieved in Kafka 3.0 and beyond.

#### 2. Plan the Migration

- **Define Migration Goals**: Establish clear objectives, such as reducing operational overhead or improving scalability.
- **Develop a Migration Timeline**: Create a detailed timeline that includes preparation, testing, and execution phases.
- **Identify Stakeholders**: Engage all relevant stakeholders, including DevOps, data engineers, and business units, to ensure alignment.

#### 3. Prepare the Environment

- **Upgrade Kafka**: If necessary, upgrade to a Kafka version that supports KRaft. Follow best practices for [Kafka upgrades]({{< ref "/kafka/3/1" >}} "Installation and Configuration Best Practices").
- **Backup Data**: Perform a comprehensive backup of Kafka data and configurations to prevent data loss during migration.

#### 4. Configure KRaft

- **Enable KRaft Mode**: Modify the `server.properties` file to enable KRaft mode by setting `process.roles=controller,broker` and configuring the `controller.quorum.voters` property.
- **Initialize Metadata Quorum**: Set up the metadata quorum by designating a subset of brokers as controllers.

#### 5. Migrate Metadata

- **Export Metadata from ZooKeeper**: Use Kafka tools to export metadata from ZooKeeper.
- **Import Metadata into KRaft**: Import the exported metadata into the KRaft-enabled cluster.

#### 6. Validate the Migration

- **Conduct Thorough Testing**: Perform extensive testing to validate the migration, including functional, performance, and failover tests.
- **Monitor Cluster Health**: Use monitoring tools to ensure the cluster operates as expected post-migration.

#### 7. Execute the Migration

- **Switch to KRaft**: Transition the cluster to KRaft by updating configurations and restarting brokers.
- **Decommission ZooKeeper**: Once the migration is confirmed successful, decommission the ZooKeeper ensemble.

### Compatibility Issues and Required Kafka Versions

#### Kafka Version Compatibility

- **Minimum Version**: Ensure your Kafka version is at least 2.8 for initial KRaft support, with 3.0 recommended for production use.
- **Feature Parity**: Verify that all required Kafka features are supported in KRaft mode.

#### Configuration Changes

- **Broker Configuration**: Update broker configurations to reflect KRaft settings, including metadata quorum and controller roles.
- **Client Compatibility**: Ensure Kafka clients are compatible with the new architecture. Test client applications to confirm seamless operation.

### Testing and Validation Recommendations

#### Testing Strategies

- **Functional Testing**: Validate that all Kafka functionalities, such as message production and consumption, work correctly in KRaft mode.
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark the KRaft cluster to ensure it meets performance expectations.
- **Failover Testing**: Simulate broker failures to test the resilience and recovery capabilities of the KRaft architecture.

#### Validation Tools

- **Kafka Tools**: Utilize Kafka's built-in tools for testing and validation, such as `kafka-topics.sh` and `kafka-consumer-groups.sh`.
- **Monitoring Solutions**: Implement monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana to track cluster metrics and health.

### Addressing Common Concerns and Risk Mitigation

#### Common Concerns

- **Data Loss**: Mitigate data loss risks by performing thorough backups and validations before migration.
- **Downtime**: Plan for minimal downtime by executing the migration during low-traffic periods and using rolling updates.

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Rollback Plan**: Develop a rollback plan to revert to the ZooKeeper-based setup if issues arise during migration.
- **Incremental Migration**: Consider an incremental migration approach, transitioning a subset of brokers to KRaft first to validate the process.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

#### Case Study: Enterprise Migration

- **Scenario**: A financial services company migrates its Kafka cluster to KRaft to enhance scalability and reduce operational complexity.
- **Outcome**: The migration results in improved cluster performance and simplified management, enabling the company to handle increased data volumes efficiently.

### Conclusion

Migrating to the KRaft architecture offers numerous benefits, including simplified management and enhanced scalability. By following the outlined migration path and adhering to best practices, organizations can transition smoothly from ZooKeeper-based Kafka clusters to KRaft, ensuring continued reliability and performance.
