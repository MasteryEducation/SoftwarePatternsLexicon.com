## 2.1.3.2 Architecture Changes in KRaft

### Introduction

Apache Kafka has long been a cornerstone of real-time data streaming and processing, renowned for its distributed architecture and robust capabilities. Traditionally, Kafka has relied on ZooKeeper for managing metadata and ensuring consensus across the cluster. However, the introduction of the KRaft (Kafka Raft) architecture marks a significant evolution in Kafka's design, eliminating the dependency on ZooKeeper and introducing a new internal consensus mechanism based on the Raft protocol. This section delves into the architectural changes brought about by KRaft, exploring how it enhances Kafka's scalability, reliability, and operational simplicity.

### Eliminating ZooKeeper: A New Era for Kafka

ZooKeeper has been an integral part of Kafka's architecture, responsible for managing cluster metadata, leader election, and configuration management. Despite its reliability, ZooKeeper introduces complexity and operational overhead. KRaft addresses these challenges by embedding metadata management directly within Kafka brokers, streamlining operations and reducing external dependencies.

#### Key Benefits of Removing ZooKeeper

- **Simplified Operations**: By removing the need for a separate ZooKeeper ensemble, Kafka clusters become easier to deploy, manage, and scale.
- **Reduced Latency**: Direct metadata management within Kafka brokers reduces the latency associated with ZooKeeper communication.
- **Enhanced Security**: Fewer components mean a smaller attack surface, simplifying security management.

### The Raft Protocol: Ensuring Consensus in Kafka

The Raft protocol is a consensus algorithm designed to be easy to understand and implement. It provides a robust mechanism for achieving consensus across distributed systems, ensuring that all nodes in a cluster agree on a common state. In the context of KRaft, Raft replaces ZooKeeper's role in managing metadata and leader election.

#### How Raft Works in Kafka

- **Leader Election**: Raft ensures that a single leader is elected among the brokers, responsible for managing metadata updates.
- **Log Replication**: The leader replicates log entries to follower brokers, ensuring consistency across the cluster.
- **Commitment**: Once a majority of brokers acknowledge a log entry, it is considered committed and applied to the state machine.

    participant Follower1
    participant Follower2

    Leader->>Follower1: Append Entry
    Leader->>Follower2: Append Entry
    Follower1-->>Leader: Acknowledge
    Follower2-->>Leader: Acknowledge
    Leader->>Leader: Commit Entry
```

### Metadata Quorum: Internal Management within Brokers

KRaft introduces the concept of a metadata quorum, where a subset of brokers is responsible for managing and replicating metadata. This quorum-based approach ensures high availability and fault tolerance, even in the face of broker failures.

#### Metadata Quorum in Action

- **Quorum Size**: Typically, a quorum consists of a majority of brokers, ensuring that metadata updates can be committed even if some brokers are unavailable.
- **Dynamic Membership**: Brokers can dynamically join or leave the quorum, allowing for flexible scaling and maintenance.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Broker 1] -->|Metadata Quorum| B[Broker 2];
    A -->|Metadata Quorum| C[Broker 3];
    B -->|Metadata Quorum| C;
    B -->|Metadata Quorum| A;
    C -->|Metadata Quorum| A;
    C -->|Metadata Quorum| B;
```

### Improvements in Controller Scalability and Reliability

The KRaft architecture significantly enhances the scalability and reliability of Kafka's controller, the component responsible for managing cluster metadata and orchestrating operations.

#### Scalability Enhancements

- **Decentralized Metadata Management**: By distributing metadata management across brokers, KRaft eliminates bottlenecks associated with a centralized controller.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Brokers can independently manage metadata, reducing the load on any single node and improving overall cluster performance.

#### Reliability Improvements

- **Fault Tolerance**: The Raft protocol ensures that metadata updates are replicated across multiple brokers, providing resilience against failures.
- **Consistent State**: Even in the event of broker failures, the metadata quorum ensures that the cluster maintains a consistent state.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

The architectural changes introduced by KRaft have profound implications for real-world Kafka deployments, particularly in large-scale, mission-critical environments.

#### Use Case: High-Availability Data Pipelines

In scenarios where data availability and consistency are paramount, such as financial services or healthcare, KRaft's enhanced fault tolerance and reliability ensure that data pipelines remain operational even in the face of failures.

#### Use Case: Simplified Cloud Deployments

For organizations deploying Kafka in cloud environments, the elimination of ZooKeeper simplifies infrastructure management and reduces operational costs, making it easier to leverage managed services and scale on demand.

### Code Examples: Implementing KRaft in Kafka

To illustrate the practical implementation of KRaft, let's explore code examples in Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure, demonstrating how to configure and manage a Kafka cluster using the KRaft architecture.

#### Java Example

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClient;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClientConfig;
import java.util.Properties;

public class KafkaKRaftExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(AdminClientConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, "KRaftAdminClient");

        try (AdminClient adminClient = AdminClient.create(props)) {
            // Perform administrative operations
        }
    }
}
```

#### Scala Example

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.{AdminClient, AdminClientConfig}
import java.util.Properties

object KafkaKRaftExample extends App {
  val props = new Properties()
  props.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092")
  props.put(AdminClientConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, "KRaftAdminClient")

  val adminClient = AdminClient.create(props)
  // Perform administrative operations
  adminClient.close()
}
```

#### Kotlin Example

```kotlin
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClient
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClientConfig
import java.util.Properties

fun main() {
    val props = Properties().apply {
        put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092")
        put(AdminClientConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, "KRaftAdminClient")
    }

    AdminClient.create(props).use { adminClient ->
        // Perform administrative operations
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Example

```clojure
(require '[org.apache.kafka.clients.admin AdminClient AdminClientConfig])

(defn create-admin-client []
  (let [props (doto (java.util.Properties.)
                (.put AdminClientConfig/BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG "localhost:9092")
                (.put AdminClientConfig/CLIENT_ID_CONFIG "KRaftAdminClient"))]
    (AdminClient/create props)))

(with-open [admin-client (create-admin-client)]
  ;; Perform administrative operations
  )
```
