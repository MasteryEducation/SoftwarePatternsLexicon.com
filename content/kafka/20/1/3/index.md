#### Security Enhancements in Kafka 3.x

Security is a top priority for Kafka, and the 3.x releases introduce several features to enhance data protection and access control.

##### Advanced Authentication Mechanisms

Kafka 3.x supports advanced authentication protocols, providing more secure and flexible authentication options for clients and brokers:

- **OAuth 2.0 Support**: Kafka 3.x introduces support for OAuth 2.0, allowing for more secure and flexible authentication mechanisms. This is particularly beneficial for integrating Kafka with modern identity management systems.

- **Improved SASL Mechanisms**: The SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) mechanisms have been enhanced to provide better security and flexibility.

##### Fine-Grained Access Control

Access control is critical for ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data. Kafka 3.x introduces fine-grained access control mechanisms:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Kafka 3.x supports role-based access control, allowing administrators to define roles with specific permissions and assign them to users.

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: The ACL system has been enhanced to provide more precise control over who can access specific resources.

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.common.config.SaslConfigs;

import java.util.Properties;

public class OAuthProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        props.put(SaslConfigs.SASL_MECHANISM, "OAUTHBEARER");
        props.put(SaslConfigs.SASL_JAAS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required;");

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
        producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("my-topic", "key", "value"));
        producer.close();
    }
}
```

#### Scala Example: Improved Log Compaction

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.{KafkaProducer, ProducerConfig, ProducerRecord}
import java.util.Properties

object LogCompactionProducer extends App {
  val props = new Properties()
  props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092")
  props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer")
  props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer")
  props.put(ProducerConfig.ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCE_CONFIG, "true")

  val producer = new KafkaProducer[String, String](props)
  producer.send(new ProducerRecord[String, String]("compacted-topic", "key", "value"))
  producer.close()
}
```

#### Kotlin Example: Zero-Copy Data Transfer

```kotlin
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord
import java.util.Properties

fun main() {
    val props = Properties().apply {
        put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092")
        put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer")
        put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer")
        put(ProducerConfig.LINGER_MS_CONFIG, "5")
    }

    KafkaProducer<String, String>(props).use { producer ->
        producer.send(ProducerRecord("zero-copy-topic", "key", "value"))
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Example: Enhanced Monitoring

```clojure
(ns kafka.monitoring
  (:import [org.apache.kafka.clients.producer KafkaProducer ProducerConfig ProducerRecord]
           [java.util Properties]))

(defn create-producer []
  (let [props (doto (Properties.)
                (.put ProducerConfig/BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG "localhost:9092")
                (.put ProducerConfig/KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer")
                (.put ProducerConfig/VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer"))]
    (KafkaProducer. props)))

(defn send-message [producer topic key value]
  (.send producer (ProducerRecord. topic key value)))

(defn -main []
  (let [producer (create-producer)]
    (send-message producer "monitoring-topic" "key" "value")
    (.close producer)))
```
