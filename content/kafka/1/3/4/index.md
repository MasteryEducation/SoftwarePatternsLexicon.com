### Code Examples

To illustrate the practical application of Confluent Platform enhancements, let's explore some code examples demonstrating the use of Kafka Connect with pre-built connectors.

#### Java Example: Using a Kafka Connector for MySQL

```java
import org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.ConnectorConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.WorkerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MySQLConnectorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> props = new HashMap<>();
        props.put(ConnectorConfig.NAME_CONFIG, "mysql-source-connector");
        props.put(ConnectorConfig.CONNECTOR_CLASS_CONFIG, "io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector");
        props.put("connection.url", "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb");
        props.put("connection.user", "user");
        props.put("connection.password", "password");
        props.put("topic.prefix", "mysql-");

        WorkerConfig workerConfig = new WorkerConfig(props);
        FileOffsetBackingStore offsetBackingStore = new FileOffsetBackingStore();
        JsonConverter keyConverter = new JsonConverter();
        JsonConverter valueConverter = new JsonConverter();

        // Initialize and start the connector
        // Note: This is a simplified example. In practice, use Kafka Connect's REST API to manage connectors.
    }
}
```

#### Scala Example: Configuring a Kafka Connector for Amazon S3

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.connect.s3.S3SinkConnector
import org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter

object S3ConnectorExample extends App {
  val props = Map(
    "name" -> "s3-sink-connector",
    "connector.class" -> classOf[S3SinkConnector].getName,
    "topics" -> "my-topic",
    "s3.bucket.name" -> "my-bucket",
    "s3.region" -> "us-west-2",
    "key.converter" -> classOf[StringConverter].getName,
    "value.converter" -> classOf[StringConverter].getName
  )

  // Initialize and start the connector
  // Note: This is a simplified example. In practice, use Kafka Connect's REST API to manage connectors.
}
```

#### Kotlin Example: Setting Up a Kafka Connector for Google Cloud Storage

```kotlin
import org.apache.kafka.connect.gcs.GcsSinkConnector
import org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter

fun main() {
    val props = mapOf(
        "name" to "gcs-sink-connector",
        "connector.class" to GcsSinkConnector::class.java.name,
        "topics" to "my-topic",
        "gcs.bucket.name" to "my-bucket",
        "gcs.region" to "us-central1",
        "key.converter" to StringConverter::class.java.name,
        "value.converter" to StringConverter::class.java.name
    )

    // Initialize and start the connector
    // Note: This is a simplified example. In practice, use Kafka Connect's REST API to manage connectors.
}
```

#### Clojure Example: Configuring a Kafka Connector for MongoDB

```clojure
(ns mongodb-connector-example
  (:require [org.apache.kafka.connect.mongodb.MongoDbSourceConnector :as mongo-connector]
            [org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter :as string-converter]))

(def props
  {"name" "mongodb-source-connector"
   "connector.class" (str mongo-connector/MongoDbSourceConnector)
   "connection.uri" "mongodb://localhost:27017"
   "database" "mydb"
   "collection" "mycollection"
   "key.converter" (str string-converter/StringConverter)
   "value.converter" (str string-converter/StringConverter)})

;; Initialize and start the connector
;; Note: This is a simplified example. In practice, use Kafka Connect's REST API to manage connectors.
```
