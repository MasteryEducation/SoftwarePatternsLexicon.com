### Creational Design Patterns

#### Builder Pattern

- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Structure**:
  - **Director**: Constructs the object using the builder interface.
  - **Builder**: Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.
  - **ConcreteBuilder**: Constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface.
  - **Product**: Represents the complex object under construction.

```rust
struct Computer {
    cpu: String,
    ram: u32,
    storage: u32,
}

struct ComputerBuilder {
    cpu: String,
    ram: u32,
    storage: u32,
}

impl ComputerBuilder {
    fn new() -> Self {
        ComputerBuilder {
            cpu: String::from(""),
            ram: 0,
            storage: 0,
        }
    }

    fn cpu(mut self, cpu: &str) -> Self {
        self.cpu = cpu.to_string();
        self
    }

    fn ram(mut self, ram: u32) -> Self {
        self.ram = ram;
        self
    }

    fn storage(mut self, storage: u32) -> Self {
        self.storage = storage;
        self
    }

    fn build(self) -> Computer {
        Computer {
            cpu: self.cpu,
            ram: self.ram,
            storage: self.storage,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let computer = ComputerBuilder::new()
        .cpu("Intel i7")
        .ram(16)
        .storage(512)
        .build();
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when the construction process must allow different representations for the object being constructed.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Leverage Rust's ownership and borrowing to ensure safe construction without mutable state.

#### Factory Method Pattern

- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Structure**:
  - **Creator**: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product.
  - **ConcreteCreator**: Overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.
  - **Product**: Defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
  - **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the Product interface.

```rust
trait Product {
    fn operation(&self) -> String;
}

struct ConcreteProductA;
struct ConcreteProductB;

impl Product for ConcreteProductA {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        "Result of ConcreteProductA".to_string()
    }
}

impl Product for ConcreteProductB {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        "Result of ConcreteProductB".to_string()
    }
}

trait Creator {
    fn factory_method(&self) -> Box<dyn Product>;
}

struct ConcreteCreatorA;
struct ConcreteCreatorB;

impl Creator for ConcreteCreatorA {
    fn factory_method(&self) -> Box<dyn Product> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductA)
    }
}

impl Creator for ConcreteCreatorB {
    fn factory_method(&self) -> Box<dyn Product> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductB)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let creator_a = ConcreteCreatorA;
    let product_a = creator_a.factory_method();
    println!("{}", product_a.operation());

    let creator_b = ConcreteCreatorB;
    let product_b = creator_b.factory_method();
    println!("{}", product_b.operation());
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Utilize Rust's trait objects to implement polymorphic behavior.

---

### Structural Design Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern

- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
- **Structure**:
  - **Target**: Defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.
  - **Adapter**: Adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.
  - **Adaptee**: Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
  - **Client**: Collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.

```rust
trait Target {
    fn request(&self) -> String;
}

struct Adaptee;

impl Adaptee {
    fn specific_request(&self) -> String {
        "Specific request".to_string()
    }
}

struct Adapter {
    adaptee: Adaptee,
}

impl Target for Adapter {
    fn request(&self) -> String {
        self.adaptee.specific_request()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let adaptee = Adaptee;
    let adapter = Adapter { adaptee };
    println!("{}", adapter.request());
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Use Rust's trait system to define the target interface and implement it for the adapter.

#### Composite Pattern

- **Intent**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Structure**:
  - **Component**: Declares the interface for objects in the composition.
  - **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects in the composition.
  - **Composite**: Defines behavior for components having children.

```rust
trait Component {
    fn operation(&self) -> String;
}

struct Leaf;

impl Component for Leaf {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        "Leaf".to_string()
    }
}

struct Composite {
    children: Vec<Box<dyn Component>>,
}

impl Composite {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Composite {
            children: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add(&mut self, component: Box<dyn Component>) {
        self.children.push(component);
    }
}

impl Component for Composite {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        let mut result = String::from("Composite(");
        for child in &self.children {
            result.push_str(&child.operation());
        }
        result.push(')');
        result
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut composite = Composite::new();
    composite.add(Box::new(Leaf));
    composite.add(Box::new(Leaf));
    println!("{}", composite.operation());
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Use Rust's dynamic dispatch with trait objects to handle components uniformly.

---

### Behavioral Design Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern

- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Structure**:
  - **Strategy**: Declares an interface common to all supported algorithms.
  - **ConcreteStrategy**: Implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface.
  - **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object.

```rust
trait Strategy {
    fn execute(&self) -> String;
}

struct ConcreteStrategyA;
struct ConcreteStrategyB;

impl Strategy for ConcreteStrategyA {
    fn execute(&self) -> String {
        "Strategy A".to_string()
    }
}

impl Strategy for ConcreteStrategyB {
    fn execute(&self) -> String {
        "Strategy B".to_string()
    }
}

struct Context {
    strategy: Box<dyn Strategy>,
}

impl Context {
    fn new(strategy: Box<dyn Strategy>) -> Self {
        Context { strategy }
    }

    fn execute_strategy(&self) -> String {
        self.strategy.execute()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let context_a = Context::new(Box::new(ConcreteStrategyA));
    println!("{}", context_a.execute_strategy());

    let context_b = Context::new(Box::new(ConcreteStrategyB));
    println!("{}", context_b.execute_strategy());
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when you need to use different variants of an algorithm.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Use Rust's trait objects to encapsulate algorithms and switch strategies at runtime.

#### Observer Pattern

- **Intent**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Structure**:
  - **Subject**: Knows its observers and provides an interface for attaching and detaching Observer objects.
  - **Observer**: Defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a Subject.
  - **ConcreteSubject**: Stores state of interest to ConcreteObserver objects.
  - **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the Observer updating interface to keep its state consistent with the Subject's.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

trait Observer {
    fn update(&self, state: &str);
}

struct ConcreteObserver {
    name: String,
}

impl Observer for ConcreteObserver {
    fn update(&self, state: &str) {
        println!("{} received update: {}", self.name, state);
    }
}

struct Subject {
    observers: Vec<Rc<RefCell<dyn Observer>>>,
    state: String,
}

impl Subject {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Subject {
            observers: Vec::new(),
            state: String::new(),
        }
    }

    fn attach(&mut self, observer: Rc<RefCell<dyn Observer>>) {
        self.observers.push(observer);
    }

    fn set_state(&mut self, state: String) {
        self.state = state;
        self.notify();
    }

    fn notify(&self) {
        for observer in &self.observers {
            observer.borrow().update(&self.state);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let observer1 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(ConcreteObserver {
        name: "Observer 1".to_string(),
    }));
    let observer2 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(ConcreteObserver {
        name: "Observer 2".to_string(),
    }));

    let mut subject = Subject::new();
    subject.attach(observer1);
    subject.attach(observer2);

    subject.set_state("New State".to_string());
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Use Rust's `Rc` and `RefCell` for shared ownership and interior mutability.

---

### Concurrency Patterns

#### Actor Model

- **Intent**: Use actors to encapsulate state and behavior, communicating through message passing.
- **Structure**:
  - **Actor**: Encapsulates state and behavior, processes messages asynchronously.
  - **Message**: Represents the data exchanged between actors.
  - **Mailbox**: Queues messages for processing by the actor.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
    Print,
}

struct Actor {
    count: i32,
}

impl Actor {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Actor { count: 0 }
    }

    fn handle_message(&mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment => self.count += 1,
            Message::Decrement => self.count -= 1,
            Message::Print => println!("Count: {}", self.count),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut actor = Actor::new();

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for message in rx {
            actor.handle_message(message);
        }
    });

    tx.send(Message::Increment).unwrap();
    tx.send(Message::Increment).unwrap();
    tx.send(Message::Print).unwrap();
    tx.send(Message::Decrement).unwrap();
    tx.send(Message::Print).unwrap();

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when you need to manage state in a concurrent environment without locks.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Utilize Rust's channels for safe message passing between threads.

---

### Functional Programming Patterns

#### Monad Pattern

- **Intent**: Encapsulate computations in a context, allowing for chaining operations while managing side effects.
- **Structure**:
  - **Monad**: Provides operations to wrap values and chain computations.
  - **Bind**: Chains operations, passing the result of one as the input to the next.

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = Some(2)
        .and_then(|x| Some(x + 3))
        .and_then(|x| Some(x * 2));

    match result {
        Some(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        None => println!("No result"),
    }
}
```

- **Applicability**: Use when you need to sequence operations while managing side effects.
- **Rust Unique Features**: Leverage Rust's `Option` and `Result` types to implement monadic behavior.

### Visualizing Design Patterns

#### Composite Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        <<interface>>
        +operation() String
    }
    class Leaf {
        +operation() String
    }
    class Composite {
        +operation() String
        +add(component: Component)
    }
    Component <|-- Leaf
    Component <|-- Composite
    Composite o-- Component
```

- **Description**: This diagram illustrates the Composite pattern, showing how Leaf and Composite classes implement the Component interface, allowing for tree structures.
