## 8.1. Strategy Pattern with Closures and Traits

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. In Rust, we can implement the Strategy Pattern using traits and closures, providing a powerful way to decouple algorithms from the objects that use them.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a set of interchangeable algorithms and allow the client to choose which one to use at runtime. This pattern promotes flexibility and reusability by enabling the client to switch between different algorithms without altering the client code.

### Key Participants

1. **Strategy**: An interface common to all supported algorithms. In Rust, this can be represented using traits.
2. **Concrete Strategy**: A class or closure implementing the Strategy interface.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to the Strategy.

### Implementing Strategy Pattern with Traits

In Rust, traits are a powerful way to define shared behavior. We can use traits to represent the Strategy interface, allowing different algorithms to be implemented as separate types.

```rust
// Define a trait for the strategy
trait CompressionStrategy {
    fn compress(&self, data: &str) -> String;
}

// Implement a concrete strategy for ZIP compression
struct ZipCompression;

impl CompressionStrategy for ZipCompression {
    fn compress(&self, data: &str) -> String {
        format!("ZIP compressed: {}", data)
    }
}

// Implement a concrete strategy for RAR compression
struct RarCompression;

impl CompressionStrategy for RarCompression {
    fn compress(&self, data: &str) -> String {
        format!("RAR compressed: {}", data)
    }
}

// Context that uses a compression strategy
struct Compressor {
    strategy: Box<dyn CompressionStrategy>,
}

impl Compressor {
    fn new(strategy: Box<dyn CompressionStrategy>) -> Self {
        Compressor { strategy }
    }

    fn compress(&self, data: &str) -> String {
        self.strategy.compress(data)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let zip_strategy = Box::new(ZipCompression);
    let rar_strategy = Box::new(RarCompression);

    let compressor = Compressor::new(zip_strategy);
    println!("{}", compressor.compress("Hello, World!"));

    let compressor = Compressor::new(rar_strategy);
    println!("{}", compressor.compress("Hello, World!"));
}
```

In this example, we define a `CompressionStrategy` trait with a `compress` method. The `ZipCompression` and `RarCompression` structs implement this trait, providing their specific compression logic. The `Compressor` struct acts as the context, holding a reference to a `CompressionStrategy` and delegating the compression task to it.

### Implementing Strategy Pattern with Closures

Closures in Rust provide an alternative way to implement the Strategy Pattern. They allow us to define inline, anonymous functions that can capture their environment, making them a flexible choice for defining strategies.

```rust
// Define a closure for ZIP compression
let zip_compression = |data: &str| -> String {
    format!("ZIP compressed: {}", data)
};

// Define a closure for RAR compression
let rar_compression = |data: &str| -> String {
    format!("RAR compressed: {}", data)
};

// Context that uses a compression strategy
struct Compressor<F>
where
    F: Fn(&str) -> String,
{
    strategy: F,
}

impl<F> Compressor<F>
where
    F: Fn(&str) -> String,
{
    fn new(strategy: F) -> Self {
        Compressor { strategy }
    }

    fn compress(&self, data: &str) -> String {
        (self.strategy)(data)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let compressor = Compressor::new(zip_compression);
    println!("{}", compressor.compress("Hello, World!"));

    let compressor = Compressor::new(rar_compression);
    println!("{}", compressor.compress("Hello, World!"));
}
```

In this example, we define two closures, `zip_compression` and `rar_compression`, each implementing a different compression strategy. The `Compressor` struct is generic over a function type `F`, which represents the strategy. This approach provides a lightweight and flexible way to implement the Strategy Pattern without defining multiple structs.

### Static vs. Dynamic Dispatch

In Rust, we have two primary ways to dispatch method calls: static and dynamic dispatch. Understanding the trade-offs between these two approaches is crucial when implementing the Strategy Pattern.

- **Static Dispatch**: The method to be called is determined at compile time. This approach is more efficient because it avoids the runtime overhead of dynamic dispatch. However, it requires the exact type to be known at compile time, which can limit flexibility.

- **Dynamic Dispatch**: The method to be called is determined at runtime. This approach provides more flexibility, allowing different types to be used interchangeably. However, it introduces a slight runtime overhead due to the indirection involved.

In our trait-based implementation, we use dynamic dispatch with `Box<dyn CompressionStrategy>`, allowing different strategy implementations to be used interchangeably. In contrast, the closure-based implementation uses static dispatch, as the closure type is known at compile time.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Strategy Pattern in Rust, consider the following:

- **Flexibility**: Using traits and dynamic dispatch provides flexibility, allowing different strategies to be swapped at runtime.
- **Performance**: Static dispatch with closures can offer better performance due to the lack of runtime overhead.
- **Complexity**: Traits can introduce additional complexity, especially when dealing with lifetimes and trait objects.

### Rust Unique Features

Rust's ownership model and type system provide unique advantages when implementing the Strategy Pattern:

- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety, preventing common issues like null pointer dereferencing and data races.
- **Traits and Generics**: Rust's trait system allows defining shared behavior across different types, enabling flexible and reusable code.

### Differences and Similarities

The Strategy Pattern is often confused with other behavioral patterns like the State Pattern. While both patterns involve changing behavior at runtime, the Strategy Pattern focuses on selecting an algorithm, whereas the State Pattern focuses on changing the object's state.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try implementing additional compression strategies or modifying the existing ones. Consider using different data types or adding more functionality to the `Compressor` struct.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CompressionStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +compress(data: &str) String
    }

    class ZipCompression {
        +compress(data: &str) String
    }

    class RarCompression {
        +compress(data: &str) String
    }

    class Compressor {
        -strategy: CompressionStrategy
        +compress(data: &str) String
    }

    CompressionStrategy <|.. ZipCompression
    CompressionStrategy <|.. RarCompression
    Compressor --> CompressionStrategy
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `CompressionStrategy` trait, its concrete implementations (`ZipCompression` and `RarCompression`), and the `Compressor` context.
