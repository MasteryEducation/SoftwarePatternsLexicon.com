## 8.9. Memento Pattern for State Preservation

In this section, we delve into the Memento Pattern, a behavioral design pattern that allows us to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo functionality or maintain a history of states.

### What is the Memento Pattern?

The Memento Pattern is a design pattern used to capture an object's state and store it in a way that allows the object to be restored to this state later. The key aspect of this pattern is that it preserves encapsulation boundaries, meaning the internal state of the object is not exposed to the outside world.

#### Intent

The intent of the Memento Pattern is to:

- Capture and externalize an object's internal state.
- Allow the object to be restored to this state later.
- Preserve encapsulation by not exposing the internal state to other objects.

#### Key Participants

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. **Memento**: The object that stores the state of the Originator.
3. **Caretaker**: The object responsible for storing and restoring the Memento.

### Implementing the Memento Pattern in Rust

Let's explore how to implement the Memento Pattern in Rust, taking into account Rust's unique features such as ownership and borrowing.

#### Step 1: Define the Originator

The Originator is the object whose state we want to capture. We'll define a simple struct to represent this.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Originator {
    state: String,
}

impl Originator {
    fn new(state: &str) -> Self {
        Originator {
            state: state.to_string(),
        }
    }

    fn set_state(&mut self, state: &str) {
        self.state = state.to_string();
    }

    fn get_state(&self) -> &str {
        &self.state
    }

    fn save_to_memento(&self) -> Memento {
        Memento::new(self.state.clone())
    }

    fn restore_from_memento(&mut self, memento: Memento) {
        self.state = memento.get_state();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the Memento

The Memento stores the state of the Originator. In Rust, we can use a struct to encapsulate this state.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Memento {
    state: String,
}

impl Memento {
    fn new(state: String) -> Self {
        Memento { state }
    }

    fn get_state(&self) -> String {
        self.state.clone()
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Caretaker

The Caretaker is responsible for managing the Mementos. It does not modify or inspect the contents of the Memento.

```rust
struct Caretaker {
    mementos: Vec<Memento>,
}

impl Caretaker {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Caretaker { mementos: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_memento(&mut self, memento: Memento) {
        self.mementos.push(memento);
    }

    fn get_memento(&self, index: usize) -> Option<Memento> {
        if index < self.mementos.len() {
            Some(self.mementos[index].clone())
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

### Saving and Restoring Object States

Now that we have defined the components of the Memento Pattern, let's see how we can use them to save and restore the state of an object.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut originator = Originator::new("State1");
    let mut caretaker = Caretaker::new();

    // Save the current state
    caretaker.add_memento(originator.save_to_memento());

    // Change state
    originator.set_state("State2");
    caretaker.add_memento(originator.save_to_memento());

    // Change state again
    originator.set_state("State3");

    // Restore to previous state
    if let Some(memento) = caretaker.get_memento(1) {
        originator.restore_from_memento(memento);
    }

    println!("Restored State: {}", originator.get_state());
}
```

### Ownership and Cloning Considerations

In Rust, managing ownership and borrowing is crucial. The Memento Pattern involves cloning the state to preserve it, which can have performance implications if the state is large. Consider the following:

- **Cloning**: Ensure that the state being cloned is not excessively large, or use more efficient data structures if necessary.
- **Ownership**: The Memento should own its state to ensure that it remains valid even if the Originator's state changes.

### Use Cases for the Memento Pattern

The Memento Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:

- Implement undo functionality in applications.
- Maintain a history of states for objects.
- Temporarily save and restore states during complex operations.

### Rust Unique Features

Rust's ownership model and type system provide unique advantages when implementing the Memento Pattern:

- **Safety**: Rust's borrow checker ensures that the state is not modified while being saved or restored.
- **Concurrency**: The pattern can be extended to work in concurrent environments, leveraging Rust's concurrency primitives.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

The Memento Pattern is often confused with the Command Pattern. While both can be used to implement undo functionality, the Memento Pattern focuses on capturing and restoring state, whereas the Command Pattern encapsulates operations.

### Visualizing the Memento Pattern

To better understand the Memento Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the Originator, Memento, and Caretaker.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Originator {
        -state: String
        +new(state: &str)
        +set_state(state: &str)
        +get_state() String
        +save_to_memento() Memento
        +restore_from_memento(memento: Memento)
    }

    class Memento {
        -state: String
        +new(state: String)
        +get_state() String
    }

    class Caretaker {
        -mementos: Vec~Memento~
        +new()
        +add_memento(memento: Memento)
        +get_memento(index: usize) Option~Memento~
    }

    Originator --> Memento
    Caretaker --> Memento
```
