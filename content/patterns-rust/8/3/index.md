## 8.3. Command Pattern via Enums and Dispatchers

### Introduction

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations, as well as support for undoable operations. In Rust, we can leverage enums and dispatchers to implement the Command Pattern effectively, offering a robust solution for encapsulating requests and enhancing code flexibility.

### Intent of the Command Pattern

The primary intent of the Command Pattern is to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests. It also provides support for undoable operations, which is a significant advantage in applications requiring reversible actions.

### Key Participants

1. **Command**: Declares an interface for executing an operation.
2. **ConcreteCommand**: Defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action. Implements the Execute method by invoking the corresponding operations on Receiver.
3. **Client**: Creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.
4. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request.
5. **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.

### Representing Commands Using Enums

In Rust, enums are a powerful way to represent a set of related commands. Each variant of the enum can encapsulate different data and behavior, making it an excellent choice for implementing the Command Pattern.

```rust
enum Command {
    Add(i32),
    Subtract(i32),
    Multiply(i32),
    Divide(i32),
}
```

In this example, each variant of the `Command` enum represents a different operation, encapsulating the necessary data to perform that operation.

### Command Execution Through Match Statements

Once we have defined our commands using an enum, we can execute them using Rust's powerful pattern matching capabilities. This approach allows us to dispatch commands to the appropriate handler based on the variant.

```rust
fn execute_command(command: Command, current_value: i32) -> i32 {
    match command {
        Command::Add(value) => current_value + value,
        Command::Subtract(value) => current_value - value,
        Command::Multiply(value) => current_value * value,
        Command::Divide(value) => {
            if value != 0 {
                current_value / value
            } else {
                println!("Cannot divide by zero");
                current_value
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Implementing a Dispatcher

A dispatcher can be used to manage and execute commands. It acts as an invoker in the Command Pattern, maintaining a history of executed commands for potential undo/redo functionality.

```rust
struct CommandDispatcher {
    history: Vec<Command>,
}

impl CommandDispatcher {
    fn new() -> Self {
        CommandDispatcher { history: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn execute(&mut self, command: Command, current_value: &mut i32) {
        *current_value = execute_command(command.clone(), *current_value);
        self.history.push(command);
    }

    fn undo(&mut self, current_value: &mut i32) {
        if let Some(command) = self.history.pop() {
            *current_value = match command {
                Command::Add(value) => *current_value - value,
                Command::Subtract(value) => *current_value + value,
                Command::Multiply(value) => *current_value / value,
                Command::Divide(value) => *current_value * value,
            };
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Using the Command Pattern

- **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code, adhering to the open/closed principle.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: By maintaining a history of commands, we can easily implement undo and redo operations.
- **Parameterization**: Clients can be parameterized with different requests, allowing for flexible and dynamic behavior.

### Rust Unique Features

Rust's ownership model and pattern matching provide unique advantages when implementing the Command Pattern. The use of enums allows for a type-safe way to represent commands, while pattern matching offers a concise and expressive way to dispatch commands.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

The Command Pattern is often compared to the Strategy Pattern. While both encapsulate behavior, the Command Pattern focuses on encapsulating requests as objects, whereas the Strategy Pattern is about selecting an algorithm at runtime.

### Visualizing the Command Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Command Pattern, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    participant Command
    participant Receiver

    Client->>Invoker: Create Command
    Invoker->>Command: Execute
    Command->>Receiver: Action
    Receiver-->>Command: Result
    Command-->>Invoker: Result
    Invoker-->>Client: Result
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code by adding new command variants, such as `Power` or `Modulo`, and implement their execution logic. Try extending the dispatcher to support redo functionality.
