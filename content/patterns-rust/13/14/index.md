## 13.14. Error Handling and Logging in Web Contexts

In the realm of web development, effective error handling and logging are crucial for building robust, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. Rust, with its strong emphasis on safety and performance, provides powerful tools and patterns for managing errors and implementing logging. In this section, we will explore best practices for error handling in web applications, demonstrate how to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages, and introduce logging frameworks and techniques for monitoring and debugging.

### Best Practices for Error Handling in Web Applications

Error handling in web applications involves more than just catching exceptions. It requires a systematic approach to anticipate potential failures, provide meaningful feedback to users, and ensure that the application remains stable and secure. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Use Result and Option Types**: Rust's `Result` and `Option` types are fundamental for error handling. Use `Result` for operations that can fail and `Option` for optional values. This encourages explicit error handling and reduces the likelihood of runtime errors.

2. **Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes**: When an error occurs in a web application, it's important to return the correct HTTP status code. This helps clients understand the nature of the error and take appropriate action. For example, return `404 Not Found` for missing resources and `500 Internal Server Error` for server-side issues.

3. **Provide Meaningful Error Messages**: Error messages should be clear and informative, helping users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages to prevent security vulnerabilities.

4. **Implement Custom Error Handlers**: Custom error handlers allow you to define how different types of errors are processed and presented to users. This can include rendering custom error pages or logging errors for further analysis.

5. **Use Structured Error Types**: Define structured error types that encapsulate different error scenarios. This makes it easier to handle errors consistently and provides a clear contract for error handling.

### Returning Appropriate HTTP Status Codes and Error Messages

In Rust web applications, returning the correct HTTP status code and error message is essential for effective error handling. Let's explore how to achieve this using Actix-web and Rocket, two popular web frameworks in Rust.

#### Actix-web Example

Actix-web provides a flexible way to handle errors and return appropriate HTTP responses. Here's an example of how to define a custom error type and implement error handling in an Actix-web application:

```rust
use actix_web::{error, web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Result};
use derive_more::{Display, Error};

#[derive(Debug, Display, Error)]
enum MyError {
    #[display(fmt = "Not Found")]
    NotFound,
    #[display(fmt = "Internal Server Error")]
    InternalServerError,
}

impl error::ResponseError for MyError {
    fn error_response(&self) -> HttpResponse {
        match *self {
            MyError::NotFound => HttpResponse::NotFound().json("Resource not found"),
            MyError::InternalServerError => HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Internal server error"),
        }
    }
}

async fn index() -> Result<&'static str, MyError> {
    Err(MyError::NotFound)
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/", web::get().to(index))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

In this example, we define a custom error type `MyError` using the `derive_more` crate for convenience. We implement the `ResponseError` trait to map errors to HTTP responses. The `index` handler returns a `Result` type, allowing us to return errors that are automatically converted to HTTP responses.

#### Rocket Example

Rocket simplifies error handling by allowing you to define custom error catchers. Here's an example of how to handle errors in a Rocket application:

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

use rocket::http::Status;
use rocket::response::status;
use rocket::Request;

#[catch(404)]
fn not_found(req: &Request) -> status::Custom<&'static str> {
    status::Custom(Status::NotFound, "Resource not found")
}

#[catch(500)]
fn internal_error(req: &Request) -> status::Custom<&'static str> {
    status::Custom(Status::InternalServerError, "Internal server error")
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build()
        .register("/", catchers![not_found, internal_error])
}
```

In this Rocket example, we define custom error catchers for `404 Not Found` and `500 Internal Server Error`. These catchers return a `Custom` response with a status code and message. The `rocket` function registers these catchers with the application.

### Implementing Custom Error Handlers

Custom error handlers allow you to define how errors are processed and presented to users. In Actix-web, you can implement custom error handlers by defining a type that implements the `ResponseError` trait. In Rocket, you can define custom error catchers as shown in the previous example.

Custom error handlers are useful for:

- **Rendering Custom Error Pages**: Instead of returning plain text error messages, you can render HTML error pages that provide a better user experience.
- **Logging Errors**: Custom error handlers can log errors for further analysis, helping you identify and fix issues in your application.
- **Handling Specific Error Types**: You can define different handlers for different error types, allowing you to tailor the response based on the error.

### Introducing Logging Frameworks

Logging is an essential part of any web application, providing insights into the application's behavior and helping diagnose issues. Rust offers several logging frameworks that can be integrated into web applications.

#### The `log` Crate

The `log` crate provides a lightweight logging facade that allows you to log messages at different levels (e.g., error, warn, info, debug, trace). Here's how to use it in a Rust application:

```rust
use log::{info, warn, error};

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();

    info!("Application started");
    warn!("This is a warning message");
    error!("An error occurred");
}
```

In this example, we use the `env_logger` crate to initialize the logger. We then log messages at different levels using the `log` macros.

#### Structured Logging with `slog`

Structured logging provides more context for log messages, making it easier to analyze logs. The `slog` crate is a popular choice for structured logging in Rust:

```rust
use slog::{Drain, Logger, o, info};

fn main() {
    let decorator = slog_term::TermDecorator::new().build();
    let drain = slog_term::CompactFormat::new(decorator).build().fuse();
    let drain = slog_async::Async::new(drain).build().fuse();
    let log = Logger::root(drain, o!("version" => "1.0"));

    info!(log, "Application started"; "user" => "admin");
}
```

In this example, we create a `Logger` with structured fields using `slog`. The `info` macro logs a message with additional context.

### The Importance of Structured Logging and Correlation IDs

Structured logging enhances the usefulness of logs by providing additional context. This can include information such as request IDs, user IDs, and other metadata. Correlation IDs are unique identifiers assigned to each request, allowing you to trace the flow of a request through the application.

#### Implementing Correlation IDs

To implement correlation IDs, you can generate a unique ID for each request and include it in log messages. Here's an example using Actix-web:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, HttpRequest, Result};
use uuid::Uuid;
use log::info;

async fn index(req: HttpRequest) -> Result<&'static str> {
    let correlation_id = Uuid::new_v4();
    info!("Handling request"; "correlation_id" => correlation_id.to_string());
    Ok("Hello, world!")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    env_logger::init();

    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .wrap_fn(|req, srv| {
                let correlation_id = Uuid::new_v4();
                req.extensions_mut().insert(correlation_id);
                srv.call(req)
            })
            .route("/", web::get().to(index))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

In this example, we generate a `Uuid` for each request and include it in log messages. The correlation ID is stored in the request's extensions, allowing it to be accessed throughout the request's lifecycle.

### Monitoring Tools and Techniques

Monitoring is crucial for detecting and diagnosing issues in web applications. It involves collecting metrics, logs, and traces to gain insights into the application's performance and behavior.

#### Integrating Sentry for Error Monitoring

Sentry is a popular error monitoring tool that can be integrated into Rust applications using the `sentry` crate. Here's how to set it up:

```rust
use sentry::{ClientOptions, IntoDsn, SentryFutureExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "your-dsn-here".into_dsn().unwrap(),
        ClientOptions::default(),
    ));

    // Your application code here
    let result = async {
        // Simulate an error
        panic!("Something went wrong!");
    }
    .bind_hub(sentry::Hub::current())
    .await;

    if let Err(err) = result {
        eprintln!("Error: {:?}", err);
    }
}
```

In this example, we initialize Sentry with a DSN (Data Source Name) and wrap the application code with `bind_hub` to capture errors.

#### Using Prometheus for Metrics

Prometheus is a powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit that can be used to collect and analyze metrics from Rust applications. The `prometheus` crate provides a Rust client for integrating with Prometheus:

```rust
use prometheus::{Encoder, TextEncoder, Counter, Opts, Registry};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let registry = Registry::new();
    let counter_opts = Opts::new("example_counter", "An example counter");
    let counter = Counter::with_opts(counter_opts).unwrap();
    registry.register(Box::new(counter.clone())).unwrap();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        loop {
            counter.inc();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    let encoder = TextEncoder::new();
    let metric_families = registry.gather();
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();
    encoder.encode(&metric_families, &mut buffer).unwrap();
    println!("{}", String::from_utf8(buffer).unwrap());
}
```

In this example, we create a counter metric and increment it every second. The metrics are gathered and encoded in the Prometheus text format.
