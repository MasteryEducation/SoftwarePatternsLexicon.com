## 13.5. Authentication and Authorization

In the realm of web development, securing your applications is paramount. Authentication and authorization are two critical components that ensure only legitimate users can access your services and that they have the appropriate permissions to perform actions. In this section, we'll delve into implementing these mechanisms in Rust web applications, focusing on popular frameworks like Actix-web and Rocket.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Before diving into implementation, let's clarify the distinction between authentication and authorization:

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Common methods include passwords, tokens, and biometric verification.
- **Authorization** determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. This involves checking permissions and roles to ensure users can only access resources they're permitted to.

### Common Authentication Methods

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature. JWTs are often used for stateless authentication in web applications.

#### OAuth2

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account.

#### Session-Based Authentication

Session-based authentication involves storing user session data on the server. When a user logs in, a session is created and stored, often in a database or in-memory store, and a session ID is sent to the client.

### Implementing Authentication in Rust

#### Using Actix-web

Actix-web is a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust. Let's explore how to implement JWT authentication in an Actix-web application.

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, HttpResponse, Error};
use jsonwebtoken::{encode, decode, Header, Validation, EncodingKey, DecodingKey};
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Claims {
    sub: String,
    exp: usize,
}

async fn login() -> Result<HttpResponse, Error> {
    let claims = Claims { sub: "user_id".to_owned(), exp: 10000000000 };
    let token = encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &EncodingKey::from_secret("secret".as_ref())).unwrap();
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().body(token))
}

async fn protected_route(token: String) -> Result<HttpResponse, Error> {
    let token_data = decode::<Claims>(&token, &DecodingKey::from_secret("secret".as_ref()), &Validation::default()).unwrap();
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().body(format!("Hello, {}!", token_data.claims.sub)))
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/login", web::get().to(login))
            .route("/protected", web::get().to(protected_route))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Claims Struct**: Defines the structure of the JWT claims.
- **Login Function**: Generates a JWT token upon successful login.
- **Protected Route**: Decodes the JWT token to verify the user's identity.

#### Using Rocket

Rocket is another popular web framework for Rust, known for its ease of use and flexibility. Here's how you can implement session-based authentication in Rocket.

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

use rocket::http::{Cookie, Cookies};
use rocket::response::Redirect;

#[post("/login", data = "<user>")]
fn login(mut cookies: Cookies<'_>, user: String) -> Redirect {
    cookies.add_private(Cookie::new("user_id", user));
    Redirect::to(uri!(protected))
}

#[get("/protected")]
fn protected(cookies: Cookies<'_>) -> Option<String> {
    cookies.get_private("user_id").map(|cookie| format!("Hello, {}!", cookie.value()))
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build()
        .mount("/", routes![login, protected])
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Login Route**: Sets a private cookie with the user's ID upon login.
- **Protected Route**: Retrieves the user ID from the cookie to verify the session.

### Handling User Registration and Login

When implementing user registration and login, it's crucial to securely handle passwords and user data.

#### Password Hashing

Use the `argon2` crate for secure password hashing. Argon2 is a memory-hard hashing algorithm that provides resistance against GPU-based attacks.

```rust
use argon2::{self, Config};

fn hash_password(password: &str) -> String {
    let salt = b"randomsalt";
    let config = Config::default();
    argon2::hash_encoded(password.as_bytes(), salt, &config).unwrap()
}

fn verify_password(hash: &str, password: &str) -> bool {
    argon2::verify_encoded(hash, password.as_bytes()).unwrap()
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Hash Password**: Generates a hash for the given password using Argon2.
- **Verify Password**: Checks if the provided password matches the stored hash.

### Token Management

Managing tokens involves generating, storing, and invalidating tokens as needed. For JWTs, ensure tokens are signed and verified using a secret key.

### Authorization Strategies

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC involves assigning roles to users and granting permissions based on these roles. This approach simplifies permission management and enhances security.

```rust
enum Role {
    Admin,
    User,
}

fn check_permission(role: Role, action: &str) -> bool {
    match role {
        Role::Admin => true,
        Role::User => action != "delete",
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Role Enum**: Defines different user roles.
- **Check Permission**: Determines if a user has permission to perform an action based on their role.

### Security Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Validate Input**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Limit Login Attempts**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
- **Secure Cookies**: Use secure and HTTP-only flags for cookies to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep your libraries and frameworks up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Visualizing Authentication and Authorization Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    User->>Client: Enter credentials
    Client->>Server: Send credentials
    Server->>Client: Return token/session
    Client->>User: Store token/session
    User->>Client: Access protected resource
    Client->>Server: Send token/session
    Server->>Client: Validate and respond
```

**Diagram Explanation**: This sequence diagram illustrates the typical flow of authentication and authorization in a web application. The user provides credentials, which the client sends to the server. The server returns a token or session, which the client stores. For accessing protected resources, the client sends the token or session to the server for validation.
