## 16.4. Interfacing with Hardware Peripherals

Interfacing with hardware peripherals is a critical aspect of embedded systems programming. Rust, with its focus on safety and performance, provides robust tools and libraries to facilitate this process. In this section, we'll explore how to interact with hardware peripherals using Rust, focusing on reading from and writing to memory-mapped registers, utilizing embedded HAL crates, and working with common interfaces like GPIO, I2C, SPI, and UART.

### Understanding Memory-Mapped Registers

Memory-mapped registers are a fundamental concept in embedded systems. They allow software to interact with hardware by reading and writing to specific memory addresses. In Rust, accessing these registers requires careful handling to ensure safety and correctness.

#### Reading and Writing to Memory-Mapped Registers

To read from or write to a memory-mapped register, you typically need to know the specific address of the register. Rust's type system and ownership model can help manage these operations safely.

```rust
const GPIO_BASE: usize = 0x4002_0000;
const GPIO_DATA_OFFSET: usize = 0x3FC;

fn read_gpio_data() -> u32 {
    unsafe {
        let gpio_data_ptr = (GPIO_BASE + GPIO_DATA_OFFSET) as *const u32;
        *gpio_data_ptr
    }
}

fn write_gpio_data(value: u32) {
    unsafe {
        let gpio_data_ptr = (GPIO_BASE + GPIO_DATA_OFFSET) as *mut u32;
        *gpio_data_ptr = value;
    }
}
```

> **Note:** The `unsafe` keyword is necessary because we're performing raw pointer dereferencing, which bypasses Rust's safety checks.

### Using Embedded HAL Crates

The [Embedded HAL](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) is a set of traits that provide a standard interface for interacting with hardware peripherals. It abstracts over the specifics of different microcontrollers, allowing for more portable and reusable code.

#### Example: Using GPIO with Embedded HAL

```rust
use embedded_hal::digital::v2::OutputPin;
use stm32f1xx_hal::gpio::gpioc::PC13;
use stm32f1xx_hal::gpio::{Output, PushPull};

fn toggle_led(led: &mut PC13<Output<PushPull>>) {
    led.set_high().unwrap();
    // Delay for a bit
    led.set_low().unwrap();
}
```

### Working with Common Interfaces

#### General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)

GPIO pins are used for digital input and output. They can be configured as either input or output pins and are often used for controlling LEDs, reading button states, etc.

```rust
use embedded_hal::digital::v2::{InputPin, OutputPin};

fn read_button(button: &dyn InputPin) -> bool {
    button.is_high().unwrap()
}

fn control_led(led: &mut dyn OutputPin, state: bool) {
    if state {
        led.set_high().unwrap();
    } else {
        led.set_low().unwrap();
    }
}
```

#### Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)

I2C is a multi-master, multi-slave, packet-switched, single-ended, serial communication bus. It's commonly used for connecting low-speed peripherals to processors and microcontrollers.

```rust
use embedded_hal::blocking::i2c::{Write, Read};

fn read_sensor_data<I2C, E>(i2c: &mut I2C, address: u8) -> Result<u8, E>
where
    I2C: Write<Error = E> + Read<Error = E>,
{
    let mut buffer = [0];
    i2c.write(address, &[0x00])?;
    i2c.read(address, &mut buffer)?;
    Ok(buffer[0])
}
```

#### Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

SPI is a synchronous serial communication interface used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems.

```rust
use embedded_hal::blocking::spi::Transfer;

fn transfer_data<SPI, E>(spi: &mut SPI, data: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), E>
where
    SPI: Transfer<u8, Error = E>,
{
    spi.transfer(data)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)

UART is a hardware communication protocol that uses asynchronous serial communication with configurable speed.

```rust
use embedded_hal::serial::{Read, Write};

fn send_data<UART, E>(uart: &mut UART, data: u8) -> Result<(), E>
where
    UART: Write<u8, Error = E>,
{
    uart.write(data)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn receive_data<UART, E>(uart: &mut UART) -> Result<u8, E>
where
    UART: Read<u8, Error = E>,
{
    uart.read()
}
```

### Safety Considerations

When interfacing with hardware, safety is paramount. Rust's ownership model and type system help prevent common errors such as data races and null pointer dereferences. However, when using `unsafe` code to access hardware registers, it's crucial to ensure that:

- The memory addresses are correct and valid.
- The operations do not cause undefined behavior.
- Access to shared resources is properly synchronized.

### Tools for Generating Peripheral Access Crates

The [`svd2rust`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust) tool is used to generate Rust code from SVD (System View Description) files, which describe the registers and peripherals of a microcontroller. This tool automates the creation of safe, type-checked access to hardware registers.

#### Using `svd2rust`

1. **Obtain the SVD file** for your microcontroller.
2. **Run `svd2rust`** to generate the Rust code.
3. **Integrate the generated code** into your project.

```bash
svd2rust -i path/to/svd/file.svd
```

### Visualizing Peripheral Interfacing

To better understand how these components interact, consider the following diagram illustrating the flow of data between a microcontroller and its peripherals:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Microcontroller] -->|GPIO| B[LED];
    A -->|I2C| C[Sensor];
    A -->|SPI| D[Display];
    A -->|UART| E[Computer];
```

> **Diagram Description:** This diagram shows a microcontroller interfacing with various peripherals using different communication protocols: GPIO for an LED, I2C for a sensor, SPI for a display, and UART for communication with a computer.

### Knowledge Check

As you progress, you'll gain more confidence in building robust and efficient embedded systems. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
