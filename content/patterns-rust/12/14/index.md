## 12.14. Non-Blocking I/O Patterns

In the world of systems programming, efficient I/O operations are crucial for building responsive applications. Rust, with its focus on safety and concurrency, provides powerful tools for implementing non-blocking I/O patterns. In this section, we'll explore the differences between blocking and non-blocking I/O, how to implement non-blocking operations in Rust using the `mio` and `tokio` crates, and how to handle readiness and partial operations. We'll also discuss integrating these patterns with event loops to create efficient, scalable applications.

### Understanding Blocking vs. Non-Blocking I/O

Before diving into non-blocking I/O, it's essential to understand the distinction between blocking and non-blocking I/O operations.

**Blocking I/O**: In blocking I/O, a thread is halted until the I/O operation completes. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially in applications that require high concurrency or responsiveness, as threads spend time waiting for I/O operations to finish.

**Non-Blocking I/O**: Non-blocking I/O allows a thread to initiate an I/O operation and continue executing other tasks while waiting for the operation to complete. This approach can significantly improve application responsiveness and resource utilization by allowing multiple I/O operations to be handled concurrently.

### Implementing Non-Blocking I/O in Rust

Rust provides several tools and libraries to implement non-blocking I/O, with `mio` and `tokio` being two of the most prominent. Let's explore how to use these libraries to create non-blocking I/O operations.

#### Using the `mio` Crate

`mio` (Metal IO) is a low-level library for non-blocking I/O in Rust. It provides a platform-independent interface for handling I/O events, making it a great choice for building event-driven applications.

**Key Concepts in `mio`**:
- **Event Loop**: The core of `mio` is the event loop, which listens for I/O events and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers.
- **Poll**: A structure that monitors file descriptors for readiness events.
- **Token**: A unique identifier for each I/O source, used to track events.

**Example: Basic Non-Blocking TCP Server with `mio`**

```rust
use mio::{Events, Interest, Poll, Token};
use mio::net::TcpListener;
use std::io;

const SERVER: Token = Token(0);

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Create a poll instance
    let mut poll = Poll::new()?;
    // Create storage for events
    let mut events = Events::with_capacity(128);

    // Bind a TCP listener to an address
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse().unwrap();
    let mut server = TcpListener::bind(addr)?;

    // Register the server with the poll instance
    poll.registry().register(&mut server, SERVER, Interest::READABLE)?;

    loop {
        // Poll for events
        poll.poll(&mut events, None)?;

        for event in events.iter() {
            match event.token() {
                SERVER => {
                    // Accept a new connection
                    let (mut connection, _address) = server.accept()?;
                    println!("Accepted a new connection");
                    // Handle the connection
                    handle_connection(&mut connection)?;
                }
                _ => unreachable!(),
            }
        }
    }
}

fn handle_connection(connection: &mut mio::net::TcpStream) -> io::Result<()> {
    // Handle the connection
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we create a basic TCP server using `mio`. The server listens for incoming connections and handles them in a non-blocking manner. The `Poll` instance is used to monitor the server socket for readiness events, and the `Token` is used to identify the server socket.

#### Using the `tokio` Crate

`tokio` is a high-level asynchronous runtime for Rust, built on top of `mio`. It provides a more ergonomic API for working with non-blocking I/O, making it easier to build complex asynchronous applications.

**Key Concepts in `tokio`**:
- **Async/Await**: `tokio` leverages Rust's async/await syntax to provide a more intuitive way to write asynchronous code.
- **Tasks**: Units of work that can be executed concurrently.
- **Runtime**: The core of `tokio`, responsible for executing tasks and managing I/O resources.

**Example: Basic Non-Blocking TCP Server with `tokio`**

```rust
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Bind a TCP listener to an address
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse().unwrap();
    let mut listener = TcpListener::bind(addr).await?;

    loop {
        // Accept a new connection
        let (mut socket, _addr) = listener.accept().await?;
        println!("Accepted a new connection");

        // Spawn a new task to handle the connection
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // Read data from the socket
            match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
                Ok(n) if n == 0 => return, // Connection closed
                Ok(n) => {
                    // Write the data back to the socket
                    if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
                        eprintln!("Failed to write to socket; err = {:?}", e);
                    }
                }
                Err(e) => {
                    eprintln!("Failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a non-blocking TCP server using `tokio`. The server listens for incoming connections and spawns a new task for each connection. The async/await syntax makes it easy to write asynchronous code that is both readable and efficient.

### Handling Readiness and Partial Operations

In non-blocking I/O, it's crucial to handle readiness and partial operations effectively. Readiness refers to the state of an I/O resource being ready for reading or writing, while partial operations occur when an I/O operation completes only partially.

**Handling Readiness**: Use the event loop to monitor I/O resources for readiness events. When a resource is ready, perform the I/O operation.

**Handling Partial Operations**: Be prepared to handle cases where an I/O operation completes only partially. For example, when reading from a socket, you may receive only part of the data. In such cases, continue the operation until it completes.

### Integrating with Event Loops

Event loops are at the heart of non-blocking I/O patterns. They allow you to efficiently manage multiple I/O resources and handle events as they occur.

**Integration with `mio`**: Use the `Poll` structure to create an event loop that monitors I/O resources for readiness events. Dispatch events to the appropriate handlers based on the `Token`.

**Integration with `tokio`**: `tokio` provides a built-in event loop as part of its runtime. Use the async/await syntax to write asynchronous code that integrates seamlessly with the event loop.

### Visualizing Non-Blocking I/O with Event Loops

To better understand how non-blocking I/O works with event loops, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Event Loop]
    B --> C[Register I/O Resources]
    C --> D[Poll for Events]
    D --> E{Event Occurred?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Handle Event]
    E -->|No| D
    F --> G{More Events?}
    G -->|Yes| D
    G -->|No| H[End]
```

**Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of handling non-blocking I/O with an event loop. The event loop initializes, registers I/O resources, and polls for events. When an event occurs, it is handled, and the loop continues until no more events are present.
