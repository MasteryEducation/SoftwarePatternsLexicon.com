## 5.19. The Module Privacy Pattern

In Rust, the module privacy pattern is a powerful tool for controlling the visibility of code components, encapsulating implementation details, and exposing only the necessary parts of your codebase. This pattern is crucial for designing clean, maintainable, and robust APIs. Let's explore how Rust's module system can be leveraged to achieve these goals.

### Understanding Rust's Module System

Rust's module system is designed to help developers organize code into logical units. Modules can contain functions, structs, enums, traits, and other modules. By default, items in a module are private, meaning they are accessible only within the module itself. This default behavior encourages encapsulation and helps prevent unintended interactions between different parts of a codebase.

#### Key Concepts

- **Modules**: Containers for organizing code. They can be nested and can contain other modules.
- **Visibility**: Determines whether an item can be accessed from outside its module.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal details of a module, exposing only what is necessary.

### Controlling Visibility with `pub`, `pub(crate)`, and `pub(super)`

Rust provides several keywords to control the visibility of items within modules:

- **`pub`**: Makes an item public, allowing it to be accessed from outside the module.
- **`pub(crate)`**: Restricts visibility to the current crate, preventing access from other crates.
- **`pub(super)`**: Limits visibility to the parent module, useful for sharing items between sibling modules.

#### Example: Basic Module Structure

```rust
mod outer {
    pub mod inner {
        pub fn public_function() {
            println!("This function is public and accessible from outside the module.");
        }

        fn private_function() {
            println!("This function is private and cannot be accessed from outside the module.");
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    outer::inner::public_function();
    // outer::inner::private_function(); // This line would cause a compile-time error
}
```

In this example, `public_function` is accessible from outside the `inner` module because it is marked with `pub`. However, `private_function` is not accessible because it is private by default.

### Structuring Modules to Hide Internal Details

When designing a module, it's essential to consider which parts of the module should be exposed and which should remain hidden. This decision impacts the module's API and its maintainability.

#### Example: Encapsulation with Modules

```rust
mod library {
    pub struct Book {
        title: String,
        author: String,
    }

    impl Book {
        pub fn new(title: &str, author: &str) -> Book {
            Book {
                title: title.to_string(),
                author: author.to_string(),
            }
        }

        pub fn title(&self) -> &str {
            &self.title
        }

        pub fn author(&self) -> &str {
            &self.author
        }
    }

    fn secret_function() {
        println!("This is a secret function that should not be exposed.");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let book = library::Book::new("1984", "George Orwell");
    println!("Title: {}, Author: {}", book.title(), book.author());
    // library::secret_function(); // This line would cause a compile-time error
}
```

In this example, the `Book` struct and its methods are public, allowing them to be used outside the `library` module. However, `secret_function` remains private, encapsulating the module's internal logic.

### Benefits of Module Privacy in API Design

Module privacy is a critical aspect of API design. By carefully controlling what is exposed, you can create a clean and intuitive API that is easy to use and maintain. Here are some benefits:

- **Encapsulation**: Hides implementation details, reducing the risk of breaking changes when internal logic is modified.
- **Clarity**: Exposes only the necessary parts of a module, making the API easier to understand.
- **Safety**: Prevents unintended interactions between different parts of a codebase, reducing the likelihood of bugs.

### Guidelines for Balancing Encapsulation with Accessibility

When designing a module, it's essential to strike a balance between encapsulation and accessibility. Here are some guidelines to help you achieve this balance:

1. **Expose Only What Is Necessary**: Limit the visibility of items to what is required for the module's intended use.
2. **Use `pub(crate)` and `pub(super)`**: These keywords provide more granular control over visibility, allowing you to expose items within a crate or to a parent module without making them fully public.
3. **Document Public APIs**: Clearly document the purpose and usage of public items to help users understand how to interact with the module.
4. **Refactor Regularly**: As your codebase evolves, revisit module boundaries and visibility to ensure they still align with your design goals.

### Rust Unique Features: Module Privacy

Rust's module privacy system is unique in its emphasis on safety and encapsulation. By default, items are private, encouraging developers to think carefully about what should be exposed. This approach contrasts with some other languages where items are public by default, leading to potential overexposure of internal details.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

The module privacy pattern is often compared to the facade pattern, which also involves controlling access to a subsystem. However, while the facade pattern focuses on providing a simplified interface to a complex system, the module privacy pattern emphasizes encapsulation and visibility control within a module.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the module privacy pattern, try modifying the examples provided:

- Change the visibility of `private_function` to `pub(crate)` and observe how it affects accessibility.
- Create a new module within `library` and experiment with `pub(super)` to share items between sibling modules.
- Refactor the `Book` struct to include private fields and public methods that manipulate these fields.

### Visualizing Module Privacy

To better understand how module privacy works, let's visualize the relationships between modules and their visibility:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Outer Module] -->|pub| B[Inner Module];
    B -->|pub| C[Public Function];
    B -->|private| D[Private Function];
    A -->|pub(crate)| E[Crate-Level Function];
    A -->|pub(super)| F[Parent-Level Function];
```

In this diagram, the outer module contains an inner module with both public and private functions. Additionally, crate-level and parent-level functions demonstrate the use of `pub(crate)` and `pub(super)`.
