## 2.7. Error Handling with `Result` and `Option`

Error handling is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring that applications behave predictably and gracefully in the face of unexpected conditions. Rust, with its focus on safety and reliability, provides robust mechanisms for error handling through the `Result` and `Option` enums. In this section, we will delve into these powerful constructs, explore their usage, and discuss best practices for error handling in Rust.

### Understanding `Result` and `Option`

Rust's approach to error handling is centered around two core enums: `Result` and `Option`. These types provide a way to represent the possibility of failure or absence of a value, respectively.

#### The `Result` Enum

The `Result` enum is used to represent operations that can succeed or fail. It is defined as follows:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

- **`Ok(T)`**: Indicates a successful operation, containing a value of type `T`.
- **`Err(E)`**: Represents a failure, containing an error value of type `E`.

#### The `Option` Enum

The `Option` enum is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. It is defined as:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

- **`Some(T)`**: Contains a value of type `T`.
- **`None`**: Represents the absence of a value.

### Using `match` Expressions

Rust encourages explicit error handling through `match` expressions, allowing developers to handle each case of `Result` and `Option` explicitly.

#### Example: Handling `Result` with `match`

```rust
fn divide(numerator: f64, denominator: f64) -> Result<f64, String> {
    if denominator == 0.0 {
        Err(String::from("Cannot divide by zero"))
    } else {
        Ok(numerator / denominator)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10.0, 2.0);

    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
```

#### Example: Handling `Option` with `match`

```rust
fn find_word(words: Vec<&str>, target: &str) -> Option<usize> {
    words.iter().position(|&word| word == target)
}

fn main() {
    let words = vec!["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
    let target = "banana";

    match find_word(words, target) {
        Some(index) => println!("Found at index: {}", index),
        None => println!("Not found"),
    }
}
```

### The `?` Operator for Error Propagation

Rust provides the `?` operator as a shorthand for propagating errors. It can be used in functions that return a `Result` or `Option`, allowing for concise error handling.

#### Example: Using the `?` Operator

```rust
fn read_file(file_path: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    let mut file = std::fs::File::open(file_path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

fn main() {
    match read_file("example.txt") {
        Ok(contents) => println!("File contents: {}", contents),
        Err(error) => println!("Error reading file: {}", error),
    }
}
```

### Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Use `Result` for Recoverable Errors**: Employ `Result` for operations where failure is a possibility and can be handled gracefully.
2. **Use `Option` for Optional Values**: Utilize `Option` for cases where a value may or may not be present, such as searching in a collection.
3. **Propagate Errors with `?`**: Use the `?` operator to propagate errors upwards, simplifying error handling in functions.
4. **Create Custom Error Types**: Define custom error types to provide more context and clarity in error messages.
5. **Handle Errors Explicitly**: Always handle errors explicitly to prevent unexpected behavior and improve code reliability.

### Creating Custom Error Types

Defining custom error types allows for more descriptive and context-specific error handling.

#### Example: Custom Error Type

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum MathError {
    DivisionByZero,
    NegativeLogarithm,
}

fn divide(numerator: f64, denominator: f64) -> Result<f64, MathError> {
    if denominator == 0.0 {
        Err(MathError::DivisionByZero)
    } else {
        Ok(numerator / denominator)
    }
}

fn main() {
    match divide(10.0, 0.0) {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(MathError::DivisionByZero) => println!("Error: Division by zero"),
        Err(MathError::NegativeLogarithm) => println!("Error: Negative logarithm"),
    }
}
```

### Error Conversion

Rust allows for error conversion using the `From` trait, enabling seamless conversion between different error types.

#### Example: Error Conversion

```rust
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn parse_number(s: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    s.parse::<i32>()
}

fn main() {
    match parse_number("42") {
        Ok(n) => println!("Parsed number: {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Failed to parse number: {}", e),
    }
}
```

### Visualizing Error Handling Flow

To better understand the flow of error handling in Rust, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Operation}
    B -->|Success| C[Ok(T)]
    B -->|Failure| D[Err(E)]
    C --> E[Handle Success]
    D --> F[Handle Error]
    E --> G[End]
    F --> G
```
