## 4.1.1. Structs and Enums

In the Rust programming language, `structs` and `enums` are essential tools for creating complex and expressive data models. They allow developers to define custom data types that can encapsulate related data and behaviors, making code more organized and easier to understand. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of defining and using `structs` and `enums`, explore their capabilities, and discuss best practices for their use in Rust programming.

### Defining and Instantiating Structs

#### Basic Structs

A `struct` in Rust is a composite data type that groups together related data. Structs are similar to classes in other programming languages but without methods. Here's how you can define a basic struct:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    println!("Point coordinates: ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);
}
```

In this example, we define a `Point` struct with two fields, `x` and `y`, both of type `i32`. We then create an instance of `Point` and access its fields using dot notation.

#### Tuple Structs

Tuple structs are similar to regular structs but use unnamed fields. They are useful when you want to group data without naming each field:

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    println!("Black color RGB: ({}, {}, {})", black.0, black.1, black.2);
}
```

Here, `Color` is a tuple struct with three `i32` fields representing RGB values. Fields are accessed using index notation.

#### Unit Structs

Unit structs are structs without any fields. They are often used for type-level programming or as markers:

```rust
struct Unit;

fn main() {
    let unit = Unit;
    println!("Unit struct instantiated: {:?}", unit);
}
```

Unit structs can be useful in scenarios where you need a type but don't need to store any data.

### Defining Enums

Enums in Rust are powerful constructs that allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Each variant can optionally hold data. Here's a basic example:

```rust
enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
}

fn main() {
    let direction = Direction::North;
    match direction {
        Direction::North => println!("Heading North!"),
        Direction::South => println!("Heading South!"),
        Direction::East => println!("Heading East!"),
        Direction::West => println!("Heading West!"),
    }
}
```

In this example, `Direction` is an enum with four variants. We use a `match` statement to handle each variant.

#### Enums with Associated Data

Enums can also have variants that hold data, similar to structs:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::Move { x: 10, y: 20 };
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quit message received."),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to coordinates: ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Write message: {}", text),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Change color to RGB: ({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
    }
}
```

Here, `Message` is an enum with variants that can hold different types of data. The `Move` variant, for example, holds an anonymous struct with `x` and `y` fields.

### Pattern Matching with Structs and Enums

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Rust that allows you to destructure and match data structures. It is particularly useful with enums and structs.

#### Pattern Matching with Structs

You can destructure structs in a `match` statement to access their fields:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
    match rect {
        Rectangle { width, height } if width == height => println!("It's a square!"),
        Rectangle { width, height } => println!("Rectangle with width {} and height {}", width, height),
    }
}
```

In this example, we use pattern matching to check if a `Rectangle` is a square.

#### Pattern Matching with Enums

Pattern matching with enums allows you to handle each variant separately:

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(f64),
    Rectangle { width: f64, height: f64 },
}

fn main() {
    let shape = Shape::Rectangle { width: 10.0, height: 20.0 };
    match shape {
        Shape::Circle(radius) => println!("Circle with radius {}", radius),
        Shape::Rectangle { width, height } => println!("Rectangle with width {} and height {}", width, height),
    }
}
```

Here, we match against the `Shape` enum to handle `Circle` and `Rectangle` variants differently.

### Best Practices for Choosing Between Structs and Enums

When modeling data in Rust, choosing between structs and enums depends on the nature of the data and the operations you need to perform.

- **Use Structs When**:
  - You have a fixed set of fields that logically belong together.
  - You need to represent a single concept or entity.
  - You want to take advantage of Rust's ownership and borrowing features to manage data.

- **Use Enums When**:
  - You need to represent a value that can be one of several variants.
  - Each variant may hold different types or amounts of data.
  - You want to leverage pattern matching to handle different cases.

### Visualizing Structs and Enums

To better understand the relationship between structs and enums, let's visualize them using a simple diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Point {
        i32 x
        i32 y
    }
    class Color {
        i32 r
        i32 g
        i32 b
    }
    class Direction {
        <<enum>>
        North
        South
        East
        West
    }
    class Message {
        <<enum>>
        Quit
        Move
        Write
        ChangeColor
    }
    Message : Move {x: i32, y: i32}
    Message : Write(String)
    Message : ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32)
```

This diagram illustrates how structs and enums can be used to model data in Rust. The `Point` and `Color` classes represent structs, while `Direction` and `Message` represent enums with various variants.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding, try modifying the examples above:

- Add a new field to the `Point` struct and update the code to use it.
- Create a new enum variant for `Direction` and handle it in the `match` statement.
- Experiment with pattern matching by adding more conditions or destructuring fields.
