## 24.12. Dealing with XSS and CSRF in Web Applications

Web security is a critical aspect of developing robust and reliable applications. In this section, we will delve into two common web vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). We will explore how these attacks work, strategies to mitigate them, and how to implement these strategies using Rust web frameworks like Actix-web and Rocket.

### Understanding XSS and CSRF Attacks

#### What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, and even perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Types of XSS:**

1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to users.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message or search result.
3. **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.

#### What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. By exploiting the trust that a site has in the user's browser, attackers can perform actions like changing account details or making unauthorized transactions.

### Mitigating XSS Attacks

To protect against XSS attacks, consider the following strategies:

#### 1. Output Encoding

Ensure that any data rendered in the browser is properly encoded. This prevents malicious scripts from being executed.

**Example in Rust using Actix-web:**

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Responder};
use actix_web::http::header::ContentType;
use actix_web::web::Bytes;

async fn index() -> impl Responder {
    let user_input = "<script>alert('XSS');</script>";
    let encoded_input = htmlescape::encode_minimal(user_input);
    HttpResponse::Ok()
        .content_type(ContentType::html())
        .body(encoded_input)
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().route("/", web::get().to(index)))
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

In this example, we use the `htmlescape` crate to encode user input before rendering it in the browser.

#### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded. This can prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

**Example CSP Header:**

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Responder};
use actix_web::http::header::{ContentType, HeaderValue};

async fn index() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok()
        .content_type(ContentType::html())
        .insert_header(("Content-Security-Policy", HeaderValue::from_static("default-src 'self'")))
        .body("<h1>Hello, world!</h1>")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().route("/", web::get().to(index)))
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

#### 3. Secure Default Settings and Validation

Ensure that your application uses secure defaults and validates all inputs. This includes setting secure HTTP headers and validating user inputs on both client and server sides.

### Mitigating CSRF Attacks

To protect against CSRF attacks, consider the following strategies:

#### 1. CSRF Tokens

Use CSRF tokens to ensure that requests are coming from authenticated users. These tokens should be unique and unpredictable.

**Example in Rust using Rocket:**

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

use rocket::http::{Cookie, Cookies};
use rocket::request::{Form, FromForm};
use rocket::response::Redirect;

#[derive(FromForm)]
struct FormInput {
    csrf_token: String,
    data: String,
}

#[post("/submit", data = "<form_input>")]
fn submit(mut cookies: Cookies, form_input: Form<FormInput>) -> Redirect {
    let csrf_token = cookies.get_private("csrf_token").map(|c| c.value().to_string());
    if csrf_token == Some(form_input.csrf_token.clone()) {
        // Process the form data
        Redirect::to("/")
    } else {
        // CSRF token mismatch
        Redirect::to("/error")
    }
}

#[get("/form")]
fn form(mut cookies: Cookies) -> String {
    let csrf_token = "random_generated_token"; // Generate a secure random token
    cookies.add_private(Cookie::new("csrf_token", csrf_token.to_string()));
    format!(r#"
        <form action="/submit" method="post">
            <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{}">
            <input type="text" name="data">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    "#, csrf_token)
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/", routes![form, submit])
}
```

In this example, a CSRF token is generated and stored in a cookie. The form includes this token, and it is verified upon submission.

#### 2. SameSite Cookies

Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies to `Strict` or `Lax` to prevent them from being sent along with cross-site requests.

**Example:**

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Responder};
use actix_web::cookie::{Cookie, SameSite};

async fn index() -> impl Responder {
    let cookie = Cookie::build("session_id", "some_value")
        .same_site(SameSite::Strict)
        .finish();
    HttpResponse::Ok()
        .cookie(cookie)
        .body("Hello, world!")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().route("/", web::get().to(index)))
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

### Importance of Secure Default Settings and Validation

Secure default settings and validation are crucial in preventing XSS and CSRF attacks. Always validate user inputs and use secure defaults for configurations. This includes setting secure HTTP headers, using strong encryption for sensitive data, and ensuring that your application is up-to-date with the latest security patches.

### Tools and Libraries for Preventing Vulnerabilities

Several tools and libraries can assist in preventing XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in Rust web applications:

- **[Actix-web](https://actix.rs/)**: A powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust.
- **[Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)**: A web framework for Rust that makes it simple to write fast, secure web applications.
- **[htmlescape](https://crates.io/crates/htmlescape)**: A crate for escaping HTML entities.
- **[csrf-token](https://crates.io/crates/csrf-token)**: A crate for generating and validating CSRF tokens.

### Visualizing XSS and CSRF Attacks

To better understand how XSS and CSRF attacks work, let's visualize these processes using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### XSS Attack Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    participant Attacker

    User->>Browser: Visit trusted site
    Browser->>Server: Request page
    Server->>Browser: Serve page with malicious script
    Browser->>Attacker: Execute script and send data
```

**Description**: This diagram illustrates a typical XSS attack flow where a user visits a trusted site, which unknowingly serves a page containing a malicious script. The browser executes the script, sending sensitive data to the attacker.

#### CSRF Attack Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant TrustedSite
    participant AttackerSite

    User->>Browser: Log in to TrustedSite
    Browser->>TrustedSite: Send login request
    TrustedSite->>Browser: Send session cookie
    User->>Browser: Visit AttackerSite
    Browser->>AttackerSite: Request page
    AttackerSite->>Browser: Serve page with CSRF attack
    Browser->>TrustedSite: Send forged request with session cookie
```

**Description**: This diagram shows a CSRF attack flow where a user logs into a trusted site and receives a session cookie. Later, the user visits an attacker site, which serves a page that sends a forged request to the trusted site using the session cookie.
