## 7.7. Proxy Pattern with Smart Pointers

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In Rust, smart pointers can be effectively used to implement this pattern, offering additional benefits such as lazy initialization and access control. Let's delve into the Proxy Pattern, explore its types, and see how Rust's smart pointers can be leveraged to implement it.

### Understanding the Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern involves creating a proxy object that represents another object. This proxy can control access to the original object, add additional behavior, or defer the creation of the object until it's needed. There are several types of proxies:

- **Virtual Proxy**: Delays the creation and initialization of an object until it is needed.
- **Protection Proxy**: Controls access to the original object, often used for security purposes.
- **Remote Proxy**: Represents an object located in a different address space.
- **Cache Proxy**: Provides temporary storage for results of expensive operations.

### Smart Pointers as Proxies in Rust

Rust's smart pointers, such as `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, and `RefCell`, can be used to implement proxy behavior. Smart pointers manage ownership and borrowing, which are crucial in Rust's memory safety model. By using smart pointers, we can create proxies that manage access and lifecycle of the objects they represent.

#### Key Participants

- **Subject**: The common interface for RealSubject and Proxy.
- **RealSubject**: The actual object that the proxy represents.
- **Proxy**: The object that controls access to the RealSubject.

### Implementing Proxy Pattern with Smart Pointers

Let's explore how to implement different types of proxies using Rust's smart pointers.

#### Virtual Proxy Example

A virtual proxy can be used to delay the creation of a resource-intensive object until it is actually needed. Here's an example using `Box`:

```rust
struct ExpensiveObject {
    data: String,
}

impl ExpensiveObject {
    fn new() -> Self {
        println!("Creating ExpensiveObject...");
        ExpensiveObject {
            data: "Expensive Data".to_string(),
        }
    }

    fn process(&self) {
        println!("Processing {}", self.data);
    }
}

struct ExpensiveObjectProxy {
    object: Option<Box<ExpensiveObject>>,
}

impl ExpensiveObjectProxy {
    fn new() -> Self {
        ExpensiveObjectProxy { object: None }
    }

    fn process(&mut self) {
        if self.object.is_none() {
            self.object = Some(Box::new(ExpensiveObject::new()));
        }
        self.object.as_ref().unwrap().process();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut proxy = ExpensiveObjectProxy::new();
    println!("Proxy created, but ExpensiveObject is not yet created.");
    proxy.process(); // ExpensiveObject is created here
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, `ExpensiveObjectProxy` acts as a virtual proxy. The `ExpensiveObject` is only created when `process` is called for the first time.

#### Protection Proxy Example

A protection proxy can restrict access to an object based on certain conditions. Here's an example using `RefCell` for interior mutability:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct SecureData {
    secret: String,
}

impl SecureData {
    fn new(secret: String) -> Self {
        SecureData { secret }
    }

    fn reveal(&self) -> &str {
        &self.secret
    }
}

struct SecureDataProxy {
    data: RefCell<SecureData>,
    access_granted: bool,
}

impl SecureDataProxy {
    fn new(secret: String) -> Self {
        SecureDataProxy {
            data: RefCell::new(SecureData::new(secret)),
            access_granted: false,
        }
    }

    fn grant_access(&mut self) {
        self.access_granted = true;
    }

    fn reveal(&self) -> Option<&str> {
        if self.access_granted {
            Some(self.data.borrow().reveal())
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut proxy = SecureDataProxy::new("Top Secret".to_string());
    println!("Access to secret data: {:?}", proxy.reveal());
    proxy.grant_access();
    println!("Access to secret data: {:?}", proxy.reveal());
}
```

**Explanation**: The `SecureDataProxy` controls access to the `SecureData` object. Access is only granted when `grant_access` is called.

### Considerations Around Ownership and Borrowing

When implementing the Proxy Pattern in Rust, it's crucial to consider ownership and borrowing rules. Smart pointers like `Rc` and `Arc` allow multiple ownership, while `RefCell` provides interior mutability. These features enable flexible proxy implementations but require careful management to avoid runtime errors like borrowing violations.

#### Rust Unique Features

- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety without a garbage collector, making it ideal for implementing proxies that manage resource lifecycles.
- **Smart Pointers**: Rust's smart pointers provide powerful tools for managing object lifetimes and access, essential for implementing proxies.
- **Concurrency**: Using `Arc` and `Mutex`, we can create thread-safe proxies that manage concurrent access to shared resources.

### Benefits of Using Proxy Pattern in Rust

- **Lazy Initialization**: Virtual proxies can defer resource-intensive operations until necessary.
- **Access Control**: Protection proxies can enforce security policies by controlling access to sensitive data.
- **Resource Management**: Proxies can manage the lifecycle of resources, ensuring efficient use of memory and processing power.

### Visualizing the Proxy Pattern

Below is a diagram illustrating the relationship between the Proxy, RealSubject, and Client:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        <<interface>>
        +operation()
    }
    class RealSubject {
        +operation()
    }
    class Proxy {
        -RealSubject realSubject
        +operation()
    }
    class Client {
        +operation()
    }
    Subject <|-- RealSubject
    Subject <|-- Proxy
    Client --> Subject
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The `Proxy` and `RealSubject` both implement the `Subject` interface. The `Client` interacts with the `Subject` interface, unaware of whether it is dealing with a `Proxy` or `RealSubject`.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

- **Decorator Pattern**: Both Proxy and Decorator patterns provide a level of indirection, but the Decorator pattern focuses on adding behavior, while the Proxy pattern focuses on controlling access.
- **Adapter Pattern**: The Adapter pattern changes the interface of an existing object, whereas the Proxy pattern maintains the same interface but controls access.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided examples by modifying the conditions under which the proxy grants access or initializes the real object. Try implementing a cache proxy that stores results of expensive computations.
