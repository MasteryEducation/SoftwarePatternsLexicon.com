## 7.3. Composite Pattern with Recursive Data Structures

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In Rust, implementing the Composite Pattern often involves using recursive data structures, which can be elegantly modeled using enums and smart pointers like `Box`.

### Understanding the Composite Pattern

#### Intent

The primary intent of the Composite Pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is particularly useful when dealing with tree structures, such as file systems, UI components, or organizational hierarchies.

#### Key Participants

- **Component**: An abstract interface for all objects in the composition, both composite and leaf nodes.
- **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.
- **Composite**: Represents a composite object (a node with children). It implements the component interface and contains child components.

#### Applicability

Use the Composite Pattern when:

- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- You want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

### Recursive Data Structures in Rust

In Rust, recursive data structures are often implemented using enums and smart pointers like `Box`. This allows for the creation of structures that can grow dynamically and represent complex hierarchies.

#### Modeling Composites with Enums and Box

Let's consider a simple example of a file system where files and directories are represented using the Composite Pattern.

```rust
enum FileSystemNode {
    File(String),
    Directory(String, Vec<Box<FileSystemNode>>),
}

impl FileSystemNode {
    fn new_file(name: &str) -> Self {
        FileSystemNode::File(name.to_string())
    }

    fn new_directory(name: &str) -> Self {
        FileSystemNode::Directory(name.to_string(), Vec::new())
    }

    fn add_child(&mut self, child: FileSystemNode) {
        if let FileSystemNode::Directory(_, ref mut children) = self {
            children.push(Box::new(child));
        }
    }

    fn display(&self, depth: usize) {
        match self {
            FileSystemNode::File(name) => {
                println!("{:indent$}File: {}", "", name, indent = depth * 2);
            }
            FileSystemNode::Directory(name, children) => {
                println!("{:indent$}Directory: {}", "", name, indent = depth * 2);
                for child in children {
                    child.display(depth + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut root = FileSystemNode::new_directory("root");
    let file1 = FileSystemNode::new_file("file1.txt");
    let mut sub_dir = FileSystemNode::new_directory("sub_dir");
    let file2 = FileSystemNode::new_file("file2.txt");

    sub_dir.add_child(file2);
    root.add_child(file1);
    root.add_child(sub_dir);

    root.display(0);
}
```

### Handling Ownership and Borrowing

Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety without a garbage collector, which is crucial when dealing with recursive data structures. Using `Box` allows us to create heap-allocated recursive types, which are necessary because Rust needs to know the size of types at compile time.

#### Ownership in Recursive Structures

In the example above, `Box` is used to store `FileSystemNode` instances on the heap, allowing the `Vec` to store pointers to these nodes. This is essential for recursive structures, as it prevents infinite size calculations at compile time.

#### Borrowing and Mutability

When adding children to a directory, we use mutable references to modify the `Vec` inside a `Directory`. Rust's borrowing rules ensure that these operations are safe and free from data races.

### Advantages of the Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern simplifies client code by allowing uniform treatment of individual objects and compositions. This abstraction is powerful in scenarios where the structure can be arbitrarily complex, such as UI components or file systems.

#### Simplifying Client Code

By using the Composite Pattern, clients can interact with complex structures without needing to differentiate between individual and composite objects. This reduces the complexity of client code and enhances maintainability.

### Visualizing the Composite Pattern

To better understand the structure of the Composite Pattern, let's visualize the file system example using a tree diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Directory: root] --> B[File: file1.txt];
    A --> C[Directory: sub_dir];
    C --> D[File: file2.txt];
```

This diagram represents the hierarchical structure of the file system, where `root` is a directory containing a file and another directory, which in turn contains another file.

### Rust Unique Features

Rust's strong type system and ownership model make it uniquely suited for implementing the Composite Pattern. The use of enums and `Box` allows for flexible and safe recursive data structures, while Rust's borrowing rules ensure memory safety.

### Differences and Similarities

The Composite Pattern is similar to other structural patterns like the Decorator Pattern, but it focuses on part-whole hierarchies rather than extending functionality. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for applying the right pattern to a given problem.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code by adding more files and directories. Try modifying the `display` method to show additional information, such as file sizes or directory permissions. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of the Composite Pattern in Rust.
