## 10.2. Higher-Order Functions and Closures

In this section, we will delve into the fascinating world of higher-order functions and closures in Rust. These powerful constructs allow us to write more concise, expressive, and flexible code. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use higher-order functions and closures effectively in your Rust programs.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This concept is a cornerstone of functional programming and is widely used in Rust to create flexible and reusable code.

#### Defining Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function can be defined as follows:

- **Takes one or more functions as parameters**: This allows you to pass behavior into functions, enabling customization and reuse.
- **Returns a function**: This allows you to generate new functions dynamically based on input parameters.

Here's a simple example of a higher-order function in Rust:

```rust
fn apply_function<F>(x: i32, func: F) -> i32
where
    F: Fn(i32) -> i32,
{
    func(x)
}

fn main() {
    let double = |x| x * 2;
    let result = apply_function(5, double);
    println!("Result: {}", result); // Output: Result: 10
}
```

In this example, `apply_function` is a higher-order function that takes a function `func` as a parameter and applies it to the integer `x`.

### Exploring Closures in Rust

Closures are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding environment. They are similar to lambda expressions in other languages and are a key feature in Rust for creating concise and flexible code.

#### How Closures Work

Closures in Rust can capture variables from their environment in three ways:

1. **By Borrowing (`&T`)**: The closure borrows the variable immutably.
2. **By Mutably Borrowing (`&mut T`)**: The closure borrows the variable mutably.
3. **By Taking Ownership (`T`)**: The closure takes ownership of the variable.

Here's an example demonstrating closures capturing variables:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 10;
    let add_to_x = |y| x + y; // Captures x by borrowing
    println!("Sum: {}", add_to_x(5)); // Output: Sum: 15
}
```

In this example, the closure `add_to_x` captures the variable `x` by borrowing it.

#### Closures with Iterators

Closures are often used with iterators to perform operations on collections. Here's an example using closures with iterators:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let doubled: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|&x| x * 2).collect();
    println!("Doubled: {:?}", doubled); // Output: Doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}
```

In this example, the closure `|&x| x * 2` is used with the `map` iterator to double each element in the vector.

### The Traits `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`

Rust provides three traits to represent closures: `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`. These traits define how a closure can be called and how it captures variables.

#### `Fn` Trait

The `Fn` trait is used for closures that do not mutate the environment. Closures that implement `Fn` can be called multiple times without side effects.

```rust
fn call_fn<F>(f: F)
where
    F: Fn(),
{
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let say_hello = || println!("Hello!");
    call_fn(say_hello);
}
```

#### `FnMut` Trait

The `FnMut` trait is used for closures that mutate the environment. These closures can be called multiple times, but they may change the state of captured variables.

```rust
fn call_fn_mut<F>(mut f: F)
where
    F: FnMut(),
{
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    let mut increment = || count += 1;
    call_fn_mut(increment);
    println!("Count: {}", count); // Output: Count: 1
}
```

#### `FnOnce` Trait

The `FnOnce` trait is used for closures that take ownership of captured variables. These closures can only be called once.

```rust
fn call_fn_once<F>(f: F)
where
    F: FnOnce(),
{
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let name = String::from("Alice");
    let consume_name = || println!("Name: {}", name);
    call_fn_once(consume_name);
    // name can no longer be used here
}
```

### Benefits of Higher-Order Functions and Closures

Higher-order functions and closures provide several benefits:

- **Code Reuse**: By abstracting behavior into functions, you can reuse code across different parts of your program.
- **Flexibility**: Higher-order functions allow you to pass different behaviors into functions, making your code more flexible.
- **Conciseness**: Closures enable you to write concise and expressive code by capturing variables from the surrounding environment.

### Visualizing Closure Capture

To better understand how closures capture variables, let's visualize the process using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Closure Definition] --> B[Capture Environment];
    B --> C[Borrow Variables];
    B --> D[Mutably Borrow Variables];
    B --> E[Take Ownership of Variables];
    C --> F[Fn Trait];
    D --> G[FnMut Trait];
    E --> H[FnOnce Trait];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates how closures capture variables from their environment in Rust. Depending on how variables are captured, closures implement different traits (`Fn`, `FnMut`, `FnOnce`).

### Try It Yourself
