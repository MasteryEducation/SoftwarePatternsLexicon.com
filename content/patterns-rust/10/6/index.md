## 10.6. Currying and Partial Application

In the realm of functional programming, currying and partial application are powerful techniques that enhance the flexibility and reusability of functions. While Rust is primarily a systems programming language, it offers functional programming features that allow us to implement these patterns effectively. In this section, we'll explore currying and partial application in Rust, demonstrate how closures can simulate these patterns, and discuss their practical benefits and limitations within Rust's type system.

### Understanding Currying and Partial Application

**Currying** is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for more granular control over function application and enables the creation of specialized functions by fixing some arguments.

**Partial Application**, on the other hand, involves fixing a few arguments of a function, producing another function of smaller arity. This technique is particularly useful for creating specialized functions from more general ones.

#### Currying vs. Partial Application

While both currying and partial application aim to simplify function calls, they differ in their approach:

- **Currying** transforms a function into a series of unary functions.
- **Partial Application** fixes some arguments of a function, reducing its arity but not necessarily to one.

### Implementing Currying in Rust

Rust does not support currying natively, but we can simulate it using closures. Let's explore how we can achieve this:

```rust
fn add(a: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    move |b: i32| a + b
}

fn main() {
    let add_five = add(5);
    let result = add_five(3);
    println!("5 + 3 = {}", result); // Output: 5 + 3 = 8
}
```

In this example, the `add` function returns a closure that captures the value of `a` and takes another argument `b`. This closure effectively represents a curried version of an addition function.

### Partial Application in Rust

Partial application can be more straightforward in Rust, thanks to closures. Let's see how we can partially apply a function:

```rust
fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a * b
}

fn main() {
    let multiply_by_two = |b: i32| multiply(2, b);
    let result = multiply_by_two(4);
    println!("2 * 4 = {}", result); // Output: 2 * 4 = 8
}
```

Here, `multiply_by_two` is a closure that partially applies the `multiply` function by fixing the first argument to `2`.

### Practical Benefits of Currying and Partial Application

1. **Code Reusability**: By breaking down functions into smaller, reusable components, currying and partial application promote code reuse and modularity.

2. **Function Composition**: These techniques facilitate function composition, allowing developers to build complex operations from simpler ones.

3. **Improved Readability**: Currying and partial application can lead to more readable code by reducing the number of parameters passed around.

4. **Customization**: They enable the creation of specialized functions tailored to specific needs without modifying the original function.

### Limitations in Rust

While currying and partial application offer numerous benefits, there are limitations due to Rust's function and type system:

- **Type Complexity**: Rust's strict type system can make currying and partial application cumbersome, especially when dealing with complex types or multiple layers of closures.

- **Performance Overhead**: The use of closures can introduce performance overhead, particularly in performance-critical applications.

- **Lack of Native Support**: Unlike some functional languages, Rust does not natively support currying, requiring developers to implement it manually using closures.

### Code Examples and Exercises

Let's explore more examples and encourage experimentation:

#### Example: Currying a Function with Three Arguments

```rust
fn curry_add(a: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    move |b: i32| move |c: i32| a + b + c
}

fn main() {
    let add_to_five = curry_add(5);
    let add_to_five_and_three = add_to_five(3);
    let result = add_to_five_and_three(2);
    println!("5 + 3 + 2 = {}", result); // Output: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10
}
```

#### Exercise: Implement Partial Application for a Function with Three Arguments

Try implementing partial application for a function that takes three arguments. Fix the first two arguments and create a closure for the third.

### Visualizing Currying and Partial Application

To better understand these concepts, let's visualize the transformation of functions through currying and partial application:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Function: f(a, b, c)] --> B[Curried Function: f(a) -> f(b) -> f(c)]
    A --> C[Partially Applied Function: f(a, b) -> f(c)]
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the transformation of a function with three arguments into a curried function and a partially applied function.
