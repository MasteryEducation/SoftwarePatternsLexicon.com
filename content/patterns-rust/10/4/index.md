## 10.4. Pattern Matching and Algebraic Data Types

In Rust, pattern matching and algebraic data types (ADTs) are powerful tools that allow developers to write expressive, concise, and type-safe code. These features are particularly useful in functional programming paradigms, where they enable the representation of complex data structures and facilitate robust control flow mechanisms.

### Understanding Algebraic Data Types

Algebraic data types are a way to define data structures that can take on multiple forms. They are composed of two main types: product types and sum types.

- **Product Types**: These are types that combine multiple values into one. In Rust, this is typically represented by structs.
- **Sum Types**: These are types that can be one of several variants. Rust's enums are a perfect example of sum types.

#### Rust's Enums as Algebraic Data Types

Rust's enums are more powerful than those in many other languages because they can carry data. This makes them a versatile tool for defining algebraic data types.

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

In the `Message` enum above, each variant can hold different types and amounts of associated data. This allows for a rich representation of data structures.

### Pattern Matching in Rust

Pattern matching is a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. It is a powerful feature in Rust that allows for concise and expressive code. The `match` expression is the most common way to perform pattern matching.

#### Syntax of Pattern Matching

The basic syntax of a `match` expression is as follows:

```rust
match value {
    pattern1 => expression1,
    pattern2 => expression2,
    _ => default_expression,
}
```

Each pattern is checked in order, and the first one that matches the value is executed. The underscore (`_`) is a catch-all pattern that matches anything.

### Using Enums with Associated Data

Enums with associated data can be matched to extract and use the data they contain. Here's an example using the `Message` enum:

```rust
fn process_message(msg: Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quit message received."),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to coordinates: ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Text message: {}", text),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Change color to RGB({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
    }
}
```

In this example, each variant of the `Message` enum is matched, and the associated data is extracted and used within the corresponding block.

### The Power of Match Expressions in Control Flow

Match expressions are not just for enums; they can be used with any type that implements the `PartialEq` trait. This makes them a versatile tool for control flow.

#### Exhaustiveness Checking

One of the key benefits of using match expressions is exhaustiveness checking. The Rust compiler ensures that all possible cases are handled, which helps prevent runtime errors.

```rust
fn describe_number(n: i32) {
    match n {
        1 => println!("One"),
        2 => println!("Two"),
        3 => println!("Three"),
        _ => println!("Other"),
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `_` pattern ensures that all numbers not explicitly matched are handled, making the code robust and error-free.

### Benefits of Pattern Matching and Algebraic Data Types

- **Expressiveness**: Pattern matching allows for concise and readable code.
- **Type Safety**: The compiler checks that all possible cases are handled, reducing runtime errors.
- **Flexibility**: Enums with associated data can represent complex data structures.
- **Control Flow**: Match expressions provide a powerful mechanism for branching logic.

### Visualizing Pattern Matching and Algebraic Data Types

To better understand how pattern matching and algebraic data types work together, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Match Expression};
    B -->|Pattern 1| C[Execute Block 1];
    B -->|Pattern 2| D[Execute Block 2];
    B -->|Pattern 3| E[Execute Block 3];
    B -->|Catch-all| F[Execute Default Block];
    C --> G[End];
    D --> G;
    E --> G;
    F --> G;
```

**Figure 1**: This flowchart illustrates the flow of a match expression, where each pattern is checked in sequence until a match is found.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples provided. For instance, add a new variant to the `Message` enum and update the `process_message` function to handle it. Experiment with different patterns and see how the Rust compiler enforces exhaustiveness.
