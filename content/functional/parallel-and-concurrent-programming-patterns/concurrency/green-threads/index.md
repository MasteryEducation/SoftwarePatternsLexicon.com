## Introduction to Green Threads

Green Threads are threads that are scheduled by a runtime library or a virtual machine (VM) instead of natively by the underlying operating system (OS). This approach allows for the implementation of concurrency while managing the threads entirely in user space, which can lead to several advantages and unique characteristics.

## Characteristics of Green Threads

- **User-space Management**: Green Threads are entirely managed in user space. This means that context switching is handled by the programming language runtime rather than the OS kernel.
- **Portability**: Since Green Threads do not rely on OS-specific threading mechanisms, they can provide a consistent threading model across different platforms.
- **Lightweight**: Green Threads tend to have lower overhead compared to kernel threads, as they avoid system calls and context switch operations dictated by the OS.
- **Cooperative Multitasking**: Typically, Green Threads use cooperative multitasking, where context switches occur at well-defined points in the program execution.

## Benefits of Green Threads

- **Efficient Context Switching**: Without the need for kernel intervention, context switching between Green Threads can be extremely fast.
- **Reduced Resource Usage**: Due to their lightweight nature, Green Threads allow for a large number of threads to be created without significant memory overhead.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Programmers have more control over the scheduling and behavior of threads, which can be advantageous in certain scenarios.

## Limitations of Green Threads

- **Single Core Utilization**: Since Green Threads operate in user space, they cannot take advantage of multiple cores without additional mechanisms.
- **Manual Yielding**: Programmers often need to manually insert yielding points in the code to ensure fair scheduling and prevent starvation.
- **Blocking Operations**: Traditional blocking I/O operations can block the entire runtime, affecting all Green Threads.

## Functional Programming and Green Threads

In functional programming, immutability and stateless functions align well with concurrency paradigms. Green Threads can be particularly useful in functional languages for implementing lightweight concurrency without the inherent complexities of managing kernel-level threads. 

### Example: Using Green Threads in Haskell

Haskell's lightweight concurrency model often uses Green Threads for asynchronous I/O operations and parallel computations through libraries like `async` and `STM` (Software Transactional Memory).

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent (forkIO, threadDelay)
import Control.Monad (forever)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    _ <- forkIO $ forever $ do
        putStrLn "Thread 1"
        threadDelay 1000000
    forever $ do
        putStrLn "Thread 2"
        threadDelay 1500000
```

In the example above, `forkIO` creates a Green Thread.

## Related Design Patterns

- **Actor Model**: The Actor Model encapsulates state and behavior within actors, and actors communicate through asynchronous messaging. This model can be implemented efficiently with Green Threads.
- **Reactive Programming**: Reactive Programming focuses on data streams and the propagation of change. Green Threads can be used to implement reactive systems that handle multiple reactive components concurrently.
- **CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)**: CSP is based on concurrent processes that interact through message passing. Green Threads can be utilized to implement these concurrent processes.

## Summary

Green Threads offer a method of implementing concurrency by managing threads entirely in user space through a runtime library. They provide benefits such as efficient context switching, reduced resource usage, and fine-grained control. However, they also come with limitations like single core utilization and manual yielding requirements. When used in functional programming, Green Threads facilitate lightweight concurrency models aligning well with the principles of immutability and statelessness. By understanding Green Threads and their related patterns, developers can harness their full potential in creating efficient, concurrent applications.
