## Introduction

In functional programming, the Short Circuits design pattern leverages lazy evaluation to optimize performance by skipping unnecessary computations. This approach only evaluates expressions when their results are required, significantly improving efficiency in cases where some computations might never be needed.

## Principles of Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation, also known as call-by-need, defers computation until it is absolutely necessary. Only then will it evaluate an expression, caching the result for subsequent use. This deferral can lead to significant performance gains in programs that contain conditional logic or expensive calculations.

### Example in Haskell

Lazy evaluation is a fundamental feature in Haskell. Consider the following Haskell code snippet:

```haskell
-- Definition of a list using lazy evaluation
infiniteList = [1..]

-- Function taking the first n elements
takeN n = take n infiniteList
```

Here, `infiniteList` defines an infinite list, but due to Haskell’s lazy nature, the list is never fully computed — elements are generated on-the-fly as needed.

## The Short Circuits Pattern in Functional Programming

Short Circuits is especially prevalent in scenarios involving logical operations where evaluating the entire expression is unnecessary when the result can be determined early. Here’s a simple representation:

### Logical AND Operation

In most languages, the logical AND operation `&&` short-circuits:
```haskell
andOperation :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
andOperation a b = a && b
```
If `a` is `False`, `b` is never evaluated since the result is already determined to be `False`.

## Detailed Example: Filtering with Complex Predicates

Consider a scenario where you filter a list of numbers using multiple predicates. Without lazy evaluation, all predicates would be applied to each element, leading to potential performance bottlenecks.

### Haskell Implementation
```haskell
-- Define predicates
p1 x = x > 10
p2 x = x `mod` 2 == 0

-- Combined predicate using short-circuits
combinedPredicate x = p1 x && p2 x

-- Filter list using the combined predicate
filteredList = filter combinedPredicate [1..100]
```
In this example, `filter` takes advantage of short-circuiting. For a number that fails `p1 x`, `p2 x` is never evaluated, saving computational resources.

## Related Design Patterns

### 1. **Memoization**
Memoization involves caching the results of expensive function calls and reusing the cached result when the same inputs occur again. It is often used in conjunction with lazy evaluation to further optimize performance by avoiding repeated calculations.

```haskell
import Data.MemoUgly (memo)

-- Expensive computation function
expensiveComputation :: Int -> Int
expensiveComputation n = ...

-- Memoized version
memoizedComputation = memo expensiveComputation
```

### 2. **Combinators**
Function Combinators are higher-order functions that are applied to combine the results of other functions to achieve concise and reliable logic.

```haskell
combine :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> a -> Bool
combine f g x = f x && g x
```

### 3. **Partial Application**
In functional programming, partial application refers to the process of fixing a few arguments of a function and producing another function.

```haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
add x y z = x + y + z

addFive = add 5
-- addFive is now a function of type Int -> Int -> Int
```

## Summary

The Short Circuits design pattern utilizes lazy evaluation to optimize the performance of programs by skipping unnecessary calculations. By understanding and implementing this pattern, along with related patterns like Memoization and Combinators, programmers can write more efficient and maintainable functional code. Haskell exemplifies the power and elegance of these concepts, making it an excellent language for exploring functional design patterns.

Incorporating Short Circuits can lead to significant performance benefits, particularly in large-scale systems requiring high efficiency and speed.

Using and understanding functional design patterns such as Short Circuits enhances a developer's toolkit, helping to build better, more optimized software solutions.
