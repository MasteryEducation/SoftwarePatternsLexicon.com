Dynamic Programming (DP) is a fundamental design pattern in both imperative and declarative programming paradigms. It aims to solve complex computational problems by decomposing them into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem just once, and storing the results for future use. This concept is often paired with recursion in functional programming and is crucial for optimizing algorithms, particularly those with overlapping subproblems.

## Principles of Dynamic Programming

1. **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems:** The problem can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems, which means that the presence of redundant calculations can be avoided by storing the results.

## Memoization vs. Tabulation

In functional programming, Dynamic Programming is typically implemented using two main strategies:

### Memoization

Memoization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when identical calls are made. 

Here's a simple example using Haskell to illustrate memoization in the Fibonacci sequence computation:

```haskell
fib :: Int -> Int
fib = (map fib' [0..] !!)
  where fib' 0 = 0
        fib' 1 = 1
        fib' n = fib (n-2) + fib (n-1)
```

### Tabulation

Tabulation, on the other hand, uses an iterative approach to solve the subproblems and fill a table with the results. This usually involves a bottom-up approach.

Here's the same Fibonacci sequence using an iterative dynamic programming, or tabulation, approach:

```haskell
fibTable :: Int -> Int
fibTable n = table !! n
  where table = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) table (tail table)
```

## Advantages of Dynamic Programming

1. **Efficiency:** Eliminates redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems.
2. **Optimal Solutions:** Guarantees the optimal solution by constructing from subproblems.
3. **Scalability:** Can handle large subproblems that would otherwise be computationally infeasible with pure recursion.

## Related Design Patterns and Concepts

### 1. **Divide and Conquer**

While often confused with Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer solves subproblems independently and does not store the results. Classic examples include quicksort and mergesort.

### 2. **Greedy Algorithms**

These algorithms make the best choice at each step, considering local optimal solutions in the hope of finding a global optimal solution. While simpler, they are not always feasible when compared to DP.

### 3. **Recursion**

Recursion is a natural fit for Dynamic Programming in functional languages. DP with recursion is frequently made efficient through memoization.

### 4. **Memoization**

As mentioned, this optimization technique stores the outputs of function calls. It is a core component of effectively implementing DP in functional languages.

### 5. **Backtracking**

Although orthogonal to DP, backtracking involves solving problems by attempting all possibilities. It is often combined with memoization.
