## Introduction

Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) is an optimization technique extensively used in functional programming and compiler design. The fundamental goal of CSE is to identify multiple instances of identical subexpressions within a program and then replace them with single, common computations. This avoids redundant calculations and enhances the overall performance by minimizing computational overhead and improving the execution efficiency.

## Principles of Common Subexpression Elimination

At the core of CSE lies the principle of identifying expressions that are computed multiple times and replacing these redundant computations with a single variable holding the computed result:

- **Expression Identification**: The process begins by identifying subexpressions that appear multiple times in the program.
- **Result Storage**: The computed value of the subexpression is stored in a variable.
- **Substitute Subexpressions**: All identical subexpressions are replaced with the variable holding the computed result.

### Subexpression Example

Consider the following example code:

```haskell
result = (a + b) * (a + b)
```

Here, the expression `(a + b)` is computed twice. Using CSE, we can eliminate the redundant computation as follows:

```haskell
let temp = (a + b)
result = temp * temp
```

In this transformed version, `(a + b)` is computed once, stored in `temp`, and used wherever needed.

## Advantages of CSE

- **Performance Improvement**: By reducing the number of redundant computations, CSE helps in improving the efficiency and execution time of programs.
- **Lower Memory Usage**: Reducing duplicate computations can also lead to lower memory consumption, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex computations.
- **Enhanced Readability and Maintainability**: By creating common expressions, the code often becomes clearer and easier to read and maintain.

## Implementation in Functional Languages

### Haskell Example

Haskell, being a purely functional language, leverages immutability and lazy evaluation to implement CSE naturally. Here's a more practical example:

```haskell
computeValue :: Int -> Int -> Int
computeValue x y = let commonExpr = x * x + y * y
                   in commonExpr + commonExpr
```

In this Haskell code, `commonExpr` computes the value of `x*x + y*y` once and uses it twice in the function `computeValue`.

### Scala Example

Scala, a hybrid functional and object-oriented language, also supports CSE. Sample below:

```scala
def computeValue(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
  val commonExpr = x * x + y * y
  commonExpr + commonExpr
}
```

Similar to Haskell, Scala uses a local variable `commonExpr` to store the result of `x*x + y*y` which is reused in the computation.

## Related Design Patterns

### Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation is a strategy that delays the computation of expressions until their values are needed, potentially avoiding unnecessary computations. It complements CSE by introducing efficiency in evaluation strategies.

### Memoization

Memoization involves caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. While it deals with function calls rather than subexpressions, it shares similarities with CSE in its goal of avoiding redundant calculations.

## Summary

Common Subexpression Elimination is a vital optimization technique in functional programming. It leverages the identification and elimination of redundant calculations to enhance performance, readability, and maintainability of code. Additionally, its principles dovetail effectively with other functional design patterns such as lazy evaluation and memoization. Understanding and applying CSE can profoundly impact the efficiency and clarity of your functional programs.

By leveraging the fundamentals of CSE and related optimization patterns, developers can achieve a significant boost in application performance and resource management.
