When developing software, there are often scenarios where you want to extend existing types with new functionality. Instead of modifying the original type or creating a subclass, you can use **extension methods** to add methods to these types in a clean, modular, and reusable manner. Extension methods are particularly potent in functional programming, where immutability and pure functions are highly valued.

## Introduction to Extension Methods

Extension methods allow developers to "extend" an existing type by adding new methods to it, without altering its original structure or creating a derived type. This is especially useful when you need additional functionality or want to seamlessly integrate third-party types with your own libraries and code.

### Key Characteristics
- **Non-intrusive**: You do not modify the original type's source code.
- **Type-safe**: Extension methods maintain the type safety of the language.
- **Modular**: New methods can be added in a modular fashion without cluttering the original type definition.

### Syntax

The implementation of extension methods varies among programming languages. Below, we explore examples using a few functional languages including Haskell, Scala, and Kotlin.

#### Haskell Example

```haskell
module StringExtensions where

import Data.Char (toUpper)

addExclamation :: String -> String
addExclamation = (++ "!")

toUpperCase :: String -> String
toUpperCase = map toUpper

-- Usage
-- import StringExtensions
-- let str = "hello"
-- addExclamation str -- "hello!"
-- toUpperCase str -- "HELLO"
```

#### Scala Example

```scala
object StringExtensions {
  implicit class RichString(val s: String) extends AnyVal {
    def addExclamation: String = s + "!"
    def toUpperCase: String = s.toUpperCase
  }
}

import StringExtensions._

val str = "hello"
println(str.addExclamation) // hello!
println(str.toUpperCase) // HELLO
```

#### Kotlin Example

```kotlin
fun String.addExclamation(): String = this + "!"
fun String.toUpperCase(): String = this.toUpperCase()

val str = "hello"
println(str.addExclamation()) // hello!
println(str.toUpperCase()) // HELLO
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Decorator Pattern

While the Decorator pattern also allows for extending an object's functionality, it does so by wrapping the object with a decorator class. This is different from extension methods, which do not involve object wrapping but rather inject new methods directly.

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern is used to match an interface expected by the client. Unlike extension methods, the adapter requires creating an additional interface and a wrapping class.

## Summary

Extension methods empower developers to add functionality to existing types without altering the types' definitions or creating new derived types. This lends itself well to functional programming paradigms, where immutability and modular design are key principles. By understanding and utilizing extension methods, you can write cleaner, more reusable, and modular code while maintaining type safety.
