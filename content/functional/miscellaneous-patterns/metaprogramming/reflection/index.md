## Introduction

Reflection is a powerful design pattern in functional programming that allows a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. This capability is essential for building adaptable and dynamic applications. Reflection is commonly seen in languages that support advanced metaprogramming, like Python, Scala, and Haskell.

## Core Concepts

### Definition
Reflection entails the ability of a program to:
1. **Inspect** at runtime the structure and properties of types, objects, methods, and fields.
2. **Invoke methods** or access fields dynamically.
3. **Modify behavior** by dynamically altering or generating code during execution.

### Benefits
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Programs can adapt to new conditions and inputs without needing recompilation.
- **Inspectability**: Detailed runtime introspection facilities for debugging, logging, and testing.
- **Flexibility**: Enhanced capability to integrate with other systems dynamically.

### Trade-offs
- **Performance Overhead**: Reflection operations are typically more expensive than direct method calls or field accesses.
- **Complexity**: Increased complexity in codebase, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- **Security Risks**: Opening up internal program structures might expose sensitive data or application internals.

## Practical Examples

### Example in Scala

Here's an example of how reflection can be used in Scala to dynamically inspect and invoke methods:

```scala
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

val p = Person("Alice", 30)
val mirror = runtimeMirror(p.getClass.getClassLoader)
val classSymbol = mirror.classSymbol(p.getClass)

println(s"Class: ${classSymbol.fullName}")
classSymbol.toType.members.collect {
  case m: MethodSymbol if m.isCaseAccessor => m
}.foreach(m => println(s"Method: ${m.name}"))
```

### Example in Haskell

Haskell supports reflection through its Template Haskell extension. Here’s an example demonstrating Template Haskell:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

import Language.Haskell.TH

-- | Generate a list of function names for a given type
listFunctionNames :: Name -> Q [String]
listFunctionNames typeName = do
  info <- reify typeName
  case info of
    TyConI (DataD _ _ _ _ constructors _) ->
      return [nameBase name | NormalC name _ <- constructors]
    _ -> return []

-- Usage
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn $ show $(listFunctionNames ''Maybe)
```

In this example, we are reifying the `Maybe` type to list its constructors.

## Related Design Patterns

### Metaprogramming
Metaprogramming involves writing programs that generate or manipulate other programs (or themselves) at compile time or runtime. Reflection is a runtime-focused aspect of metaprogramming.

### Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern allows the algorithm behavior to be selected at runtime. This complementary design pattern can benefit from reflection when dynamically selecting strategies.

## Summary

Reflection is a powerful and versatile design pattern within functional programming that equips developers with the tools necessary to dynamically examine and modify a program’s structure and behavior at runtime. It plays a crucial role in crafting flexible, adaptive, and introspective applications.

By leveraging the strengths of reflection, especially in conjunction with other metaprogramming techniques and design patterns, developers can overcome various challenges associated with statically-typed functional programming languages. However, careful consideration should be given to the design and use of reflection due to its associated trade-offs, particularly concerning performance and complexity.
