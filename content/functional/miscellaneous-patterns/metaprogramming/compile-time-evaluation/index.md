Compile-time evaluation is a powerful design pattern in functional programming that reroutes certain computations to occur during the compilation process rather than at runtime. This strategy, often leveraged for efficiency, allows for the precomputation of values, optimizations, and the reduction of runtime overhead.

## Overview

Compile-time evaluation is underpinned by the notion that some computations can be performed statically, before the actual program execution begins. This is particularly useful for eliminating redundant calculations and optimizing performance.

Common functional programming languages, like Haskell and Scala, as well as multi-paradigm languages like C++ (with its `constexpr`) and Rust (with `const`), offer mechanisms to perform compile-time evaluation. 

Compile-time evaluation can significantly enhance performance by:
- Reducing runtime computational load.
- Facilitating early detection of certain errors.
- Allowing for more aggressive compiler optimizations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Pure Functions:** Functional programming languages emphasize pure functions, which have the same results given the same arguments. Pure functions are ideal candidates for compile-time evaluation because their lack of side effects ensures predictable outcomes.
2. **Constexpr in C++:** C++11 introduced `constexpr` to denote functions that can be evaluated at compile-time if given constant expressions as arguments.
3. **Template Metaprogramming:** A compile-time technique in C++ that allows arbitrary computations by exploiting the template system.
4. **Macros and Inline Functions:** Used in many languages to replace code snippets before compilation, thus enabling compile-time computation.

### Example in Haskell

Haskell, being a lazy functional programming language, allows for evaluating certain expressions at compile-time when combined with techniques like Template Haskell.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

module Main where

import Language.Haskell.TH

square :: Int -> Int
square x = $([| x * x |])    -- Evaluates `x * x` at compile-time

threeSquared :: Int
threeSquared = square 3

main :: IO ()
main = print threeSquared -- Outputs: 9
```

## Related Design Patterns

- **Template Metaprogramming:** Primarily used in C++, this pattern employs templates to perform computations at compile time.
- **Memoization:** Stores the results of expensive function calls and reuses them when the same inputs occur again. When combined with compile-time evaluation, it can further enhance performance by not re-evaluating precomputed results.
- **Partial Evaluation:** Specifically evaluates parts of the program during compilation and caches intermediate results, providing a bridge between static and dynamic computation.

## Summary

Compile-time evaluation is a critical design pattern that optimizes functional programs by leveraging ahead-of-time computation. By evaluating expressions during compilation, developers can achieve reduced runtime overhead and enhanced performance. Understanding related paradigms such as template metaprogramming and memoization further extends these benefits, enabling highly efficient software solutions in both functional and multi-paradigm languages. This pattern is essential for modern, high-performance applications, where every ounce of efficiency counts.
