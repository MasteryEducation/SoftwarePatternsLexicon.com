## 10.9 AI Patterns: State Machines and Behavior Trees

In the realm of game development, creating intelligent and responsive non-player characters (NPCs) is crucial for an engaging player experience. Two popular AI patterns used to control NPC behaviors are State Machines and Behavior Trees. These patterns help in structuring AI logic in a way that is both manageable and scalable. In this section, we will delve into these patterns, exploring their implementation in Lua, and provide practical examples to illustrate their use in game development.

### Implementing Game AI: Common Patterns for Controlling Non-Player Characters

Game AI often requires NPCs to exhibit complex behaviors that can adapt to the player's actions and the game environment. State Machines and Behavior Trees are two patterns that provide a structured approach to implementing such behaviors.

#### State Machines

State Machines are a fundamental concept in AI programming, providing a way to model the states and transitions of an entity. They are particularly useful for defining clear and predictable behavior patterns.

##### Finite State Machines (FSMs)

A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a computational model consisting of a finite number of states, transitions between these states, and actions. FSMs are widely used in game development for tasks such as enemy AI, where an NPC might have states like "patrolling," "chasing," and "attacking."

###### Implementing FSMs Using Tables and Functions

In Lua, FSMs can be implemented using tables and functions to represent states and transitions. Here's a simple example of an FSM for an enemy NPC:

```lua
-- Define states
local states = {
    idle = {},
    patrol = {},
    chase = {},
    attack = {}
}

-- Define transitions
states.idle.update = function(self, npc)
    if npc:seesPlayer() then
        return states.chase
    else
        return states.patrol
    end
end

states.patrol.update = function(self, npc)
    if npc:seesPlayer() then
        return states.chase
    end
    npc:patrol()
    return self
end

states.chase.update = function(self, npc)
    if npc:isCloseToPlayer() then
        return states.attack
    elseif not npc:seesPlayer() then
        return states.patrol
    end
    npc:chasePlayer()
    return self
end

states.attack.update = function(self, npc)
    if not npc:isCloseToPlayer() then
        return states.chase
    end
    npc:attackPlayer()
    return self
end

-- NPC class
local NPC = {}
NPC.__index = NPC

function NPC:new()
    local npc = setmetatable({}, NPC)
    npc.state = states.idle
    return npc
end

function NPC:update()
    self.state = self.state.update(self, self)
end

function NPC:seesPlayer()
    -- Logic to determine if the NPC sees the player
end

function NPC:isCloseToPlayer()
    -- Logic to determine if the NPC is close to the player
end

function NPC:patrol()
    print("Patrolling...")
end

function NPC:chasePlayer()
    print("Chasing player...")
end

function NPC:attackPlayer()
    print("Attacking player!")
end

-- Usage
local enemy = NPC:new()
while true do
    enemy:update()
end
```

In this example, each state is represented as a table with an `update` function that determines the next state based on the NPC's perception of the environment.

##### Hierarchical State Machines

For more complex behaviors, Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) can be used. HSMs allow states to be nested within other states, providing a way to manage complexity by organizing states into a hierarchy.

###### Managing Complex Behaviors

Consider an NPC that has a "combat" state, which itself contains sub-states like "melee" and "ranged." An HSM can be used to encapsulate these sub-states within the "combat" state, allowing for more organized and modular AI logic.

```lua
-- Define hierarchical states
local combatStates = {
    melee = {},
    ranged = {}
}

local states = {
    idle = {},
    patrol = {},
    combat = {subStates = combatStates}
}

-- Define transitions for combat sub-states
combatStates.melee.update = function(self, npc)
    if npc:isFarFromPlayer() then
        return combatStates.ranged
    end
    npc:meleeAttack()
    return self
end

combatStates.ranged.update = function(self, npc)
    if npc:isCloseToPlayer() then
        return combatStates.melee
    end
    npc:rangedAttack()
    return self
end

-- Define transitions for main states
states.idle.update = function(self, npc)
    if npc:seesPlayer() then
        return states.combat
    else
        return states.patrol
    end
end

states.patrol.update = function(self, npc)
    if npc:seesPlayer() then
        return states.combat
    end
    npc:patrol()
    return self
end

states.combat.update = function(self, npc)
    return npc.combatState.update(npc.combatState, npc)
end

-- NPC class with hierarchical state
function NPC:new()
    local npc = setmetatable({}, NPC)
    npc.state = states.idle
    npc.combatState = combatStates.melee
    return npc
end

function NPC:update()
    self.state = self.state.update(self, self)
end

function NPC:isFarFromPlayer()
    -- Logic to determine if the NPC is far from the player
end

function NPC:meleeAttack()
    print("Performing melee attack!")
end

function NPC:rangedAttack()
    print("Performing ranged attack!")
end

-- Usage
local enemy = NPC:new()
while true do
    enemy:update()
end
```

In this example, the `combat` state manages its own sub-states, allowing the NPC to switch between melee and ranged attacks based on the player's distance.

#### Behavior Trees

Behavior Trees offer a more flexible and scalable approach to AI programming compared to FSMs. They are particularly useful for implementing complex decision-making processes.

##### Nodes and Leaves

A Behavior Tree is composed of nodes, which can be either composite nodes (such as sequences and selectors) or leaf nodes (actions and conditions). Composite nodes control the flow of execution, while leaf nodes perform actions or check conditions.

###### Defining Behaviors and Conditions

Here's a simple Behavior Tree implementation for an NPC using Lua:

```lua
-- Define nodes
local Node = {}
Node.__index = Node

function Node:new()
    return setmetatable({}, self)
end

function Node:run(npc)
    error("run method not implemented")
end

-- Define composite nodes
local Sequence = setmetatable({}, {__index = Node})
function Sequence:new(children)
    local seq = Node.new(self)
    seq.children = children
    return seq
end

function Sequence:run(npc)
    for _, child in ipairs(self.children) do
        if not child:run(npc) then
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end

local Selector = setmetatable({}, {__index = Node})
function Selector:new(children)
    local sel = Node.new(self)
    sel.children = children
    return sel
end

function Selector:run(npc)
    for _, child in ipairs(self.children) do
        if child:run(npc) then
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end

-- Define leaf nodes
local Condition = setmetatable({}, {__index = Node})
function Condition:new(func)
    local cond = Node.new(self)
    cond.func = func
    return cond
end

function Condition:run(npc)
    return self.func(npc)
end

local Action = setmetatable({}, {__index = Node})
function Action:new(func)
    local act = Node.new(self)
    act.func = func
    return act
end

function Action:run(npc)
    self.func(npc)
    return true
end

-- NPC class
local NPC = {}
NPC.__index = NPC

function NPC:new()
    local npc = setmetatable({}, NPC)
    npc.tree = Selector:new({
        Sequence:new({
            Condition:new(function(npc) return npc:seesPlayer() end),
            Action:new(function(npc) npc:chasePlayer() end)
        }),
        Action:new(function(npc) npc:patrol() end)
    })
    return npc
end

function NPC:update()
    self.tree:run(self)
end

function NPC:seesPlayer()
    -- Logic to determine if the NPC sees the player
end

function NPC:chasePlayer()
    print("Chasing player...")
end

function NPC:patrol()
    print("Patrolling...")
end

-- Usage
local enemy = NPC:new()
while true do
    enemy:update()
end
```

In this example, the NPC uses a Behavior Tree to decide whether to chase the player or patrol based on whether the player is visible.

##### Execution Flow

The execution flow of a Behavior Tree is determined by traversing the tree from the root node. Composite nodes like sequences and selectors dictate the order in which child nodes are evaluated.

###### Determining Behavior Based on Tree Traversal

In the Behavior Tree example above, the `Selector` node first checks if the player is visible and, if so, executes the `chasePlayer` action. If the player is not visible, it defaults to the `patrol` action.

### Use Cases and Examples

State Machines and Behavior Trees are versatile patterns that can be applied to various AI scenarios in game development.

#### Enemy AI

For enemy AI, FSMs can be used to model simple behaviors like patrolling and attacking, while Behavior Trees can handle more complex decision-making processes, such as choosing between different attack strategies based on the player's actions.

#### Game Character Behaviors

Both patterns can be used to implement diverse character behaviors, from simple NPCs that follow predefined paths to complex AI that adapts to the player's tactics and the game environment.

### Visualizing State Machines and Behavior Trees

To better understand the structure and flow of State Machines and Behavior Trees, let's visualize these concepts using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Finite State Machine Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Patrol : seesPlayer == false
    Idle --> Chase : seesPlayer == true
    Patrol --> Chase : seesPlayer == true
    Chase --> Attack : isCloseToPlayer == true
    Chase --> Patrol : seesPlayer == false
    Attack --> Chase : isCloseToPlayer == false
```

**Figure 1:** A simple FSM for an enemy NPC with states for idle, patrol, chase, and attack.

#### Behavior Tree Diagram

```mermaid

    A[Selector] --> B[Sequence]
    A --> C[Patrol]
    B --> D{seesPlayer?}
    B --> E[Chase Player]
```

**Figure 2:** A Behavior Tree for an NPC that decides whether to chase the player or patrol.
