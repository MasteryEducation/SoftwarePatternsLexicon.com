## 10.10 Implementing AI Algorithms: Tic-Tac-Toe and the Minimax Algorithm

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in games is a fascinating field that allows us to create opponents that can challenge human players. In this section, we will delve into implementing AI algorithms in Lua, focusing on the Minimax algorithm to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This exploration will cover the fundamentals of the Minimax algorithm, its optimization through alpha-beta pruning, and practical use cases in game development.

### Understanding the Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in turn-based games. It is designed to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. When dealing with two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe, the algorithm assumes that both players are playing optimally. The goal is to find the best move for the player by evaluating all possible moves and their outcomes.

#### Key Concepts of Minimax

- **Game Tree**: A tree structure where each node represents a game state, and each edge represents a move.
- **Maximizing Player**: The player trying to maximize their score.
- **Minimizing Player**: The opponent trying to minimize the maximizing player's score.
- **Terminal State**: A game state where the game ends (win, lose, or draw).
- **Utility Function**: A function that assigns a numerical value to terminal states, indicating the desirability of the outcome.

### Implementing Minimax in Lua

Let's implement the Minimax algorithm in Lua for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. We'll start by defining the game board and utility functions.

#### Setting Up the Game Board

```lua
-- Define the Tic-Tac-Toe board
local board = {
    {' ', ' ', ' '},
    {' ', ' ', ' '},
    {' ', ' ', ' '}
}

-- Function to print the board
local function printBoard(board)
    for i = 1, 3 do
        print(table.concat(board[i], " | "))
        if i < 3 then
            print("---------")
        end
    end
end

-- Function to check for a win
local function checkWin(board, player)
    -- Check rows, columns, and diagonals
    for i = 1, 3 do
        if board[i][1] == player and board[i][2] == player and board[i][3] == player then
            return true
        end
        if board[1][i] == player and board[2][i] == player and board[3][i] == player then
            return true
        end
    end
    if board[1][1] == player and board[2][2] == player and board[3][3] == player then
        return true
    end
    if board[1][3] == player and board[2][2] == player and board[3][1] == player then
        return true
    end
    return false
end

-- Function to check for a draw
local function checkDraw(board)
    for i = 1, 3 do
        for j = 1, 3 do
            if board[i][j] == ' ' then
                return false
            end
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

#### Implementing the Minimax Function

The Minimax function will recursively evaluate all possible moves and return the best move for the player.

```lua
-- Minimax algorithm implementation
local function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing)
    local scores = { X = 1, O = -1, draw = 0 }
    local player = isMaximizing and 'X' or 'O'

    if checkWin(board, 'X') then
        return scores.X
    elseif checkWin(board, 'O') then
        return scores.O
    elseif checkDraw(board) then
        return scores.draw
    end

    if isMaximizing then
        local bestScore = -math.huge
        for i = 1, 3 do
            for j = 1, 3 do
                if board[i][j] == ' ' then
                    board[i][j] = 'X'
                    local score = minimax(board, depth + 1, false)
                    board[i][j] = ' '
                    bestScore = math.max(score, bestScore)
                end
            end
        end
        return bestScore
    else
        local bestScore = math.huge
        for i = 1, 3 do
            for j = 1, 3 do
                if board[i][j] == ' ' then
                    board[i][j] = 'O'
                    local score = minimax(board, depth + 1, true)
                    board[i][j] = ' '
                    bestScore = math.min(score, bestScore)
                end
            end
        end
        return bestScore
    end
end
```

#### Choosing the Best Move

Now, let's create a function to choose the best move for the AI.

```lua
-- Function to find the best move for the AI
local function findBestMove(board)
    local bestScore = -math.huge
    local move = { row = -1, col = -1 }

    for i = 1, 3 do
        for j = 1, 3 do
            if board[i][j] == ' ' then
                board[i][j] = 'X'
                local score = minimax(board, 0, false)
                board[i][j] = ' '
                if score > bestScore then
                    bestScore = score
                    move = { row = i, col = j }
                end
            end
        end
    end
    return move
end
```

### Optimizing Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree. It works by eliminating branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.

#### Implementing Alpha-Beta Pruning

Let's enhance our Minimax function with alpha-beta pruning.

```lua
-- Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
local function minimaxAlphaBeta(board, depth, alpha, beta, isMaximizing)
    local scores = { X = 1, O = -1, draw = 0 }
    local player = isMaximizing and 'X' or 'O'

    if checkWin(board, 'X') then
        return scores.X
    elseif checkWin(board, 'O') then
        return scores.O
    elseif checkDraw(board) then
        return scores.draw
    end

    if isMaximizing then
        local bestScore = -math.huge
        for i = 1, 3 do
            for j = 1, 3 do
                if board[i][j] == ' ' then
                    board[i][j] = 'X'
                    local score = minimaxAlphaBeta(board, depth + 1, alpha, beta, false)
                    board[i][j] = ' '
                    bestScore = math.max(score, bestScore)
                    alpha = math.max(alpha, score)
                    if beta <= alpha then
                        break
                    end
                end
            end
        end
        return bestScore
    else
        local bestScore = math.huge
        for i = 1, 3 do
            for j = 1, 3 do
                if board[i][j] == ' ' then
                    board[i][j] = 'O'
                    local score = minimaxAlphaBeta(board, depth + 1, alpha, beta, true)
                    board[i][j] = ' '
                    bestScore = math.min(score, bestScore)
                    beta = math.min(beta, score)
                    if beta <= alpha then
                        break
                    end
                end
            end
        end
        return bestScore
    end
end
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Minimax algorithm, especially with alpha-beta pruning, is applicable in various turn-based strategy games and puzzle games. It provides a robust framework for AI decision-making, ensuring that the AI plays optimally.

#### Turn-Based Strategy Games

In games like chess or checkers, the Minimax algorithm can be used to evaluate potential moves and select the best strategy. By incorporating alpha-beta pruning, the AI can efficiently search deeper into the game tree, making more informed decisions.

#### Puzzle Games

Puzzle games that involve decision-making, such as Sudoku or Connect Four, can also benefit from the Minimax algorithm. The AI can evaluate different configurations and choose the optimal path to solve the puzzle or achieve the highest score.

### Visualizing the Minimax Algorithm

To better understand the Minimax algorithm, let's visualize the decision-making process using a game tree.

    B --> C[Player O Move]
    C --> D[Player X Move]
    D --> E[Terminal State: Win/Lose/Draw]
    C --> F[Player X Move]
    F --> G[Terminal State: Win/Lose/Draw]
    B --> H[Player O Move]
    H --> I[Player X Move]
    I --> J[Terminal State: Win/Lose/Draw]
```
