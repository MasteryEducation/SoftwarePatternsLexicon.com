## 6.10.2 Data Mapper Pattern

In the realm of software design, the Data Mapper Pattern is a powerful structural design pattern that plays a crucial role in separating data and domain logic. By mapping objects to the database without requiring the objects to know about the database, this pattern provides a clean separation of concerns, enhancing the flexibility and maintainability of your application. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of implementing the Data Mapper Pattern in Lua, explore its use cases, and provide practical examples to solidify your understanding.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Data Mapper Pattern is to separate the in-memory representation of data from the database, allowing domain objects to remain unaware of the underlying data storage mechanisms. This separation facilitates the implementation of complex business logic without being constrained by the specifics of data access.

### Key Participants

1. **Domain Objects**: These are the objects that represent the business logic and are independent of the database.
2. **Mapper Objects**: These are responsible for transferring data between the domain objects and the database.
3. **Database**: The storage system where data is persisted.

### Applicability

The Data Mapper Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- Complex business logic needs to be implemented without being tightly coupled to data storage.
- Flexibility in data storage is required, allowing for changes in the database schema without affecting the domain logic.
- A clear separation of concerns is desired to enhance maintainability and testability.

### Implementing Data Mapper in Lua

#### Mapper Objects

Mapper objects are the backbone of the Data Mapper Pattern. They are responsible for handling the data access logic, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. In Lua, we can implement mapper objects using tables and functions.

```lua
-- Define a simple User domain object
User = {}
User.__index = User

function User:new(id, name, email)
    local user = setmetatable({}, User)
    user.id = id
    user.name = name
    user.email = email
    return user
end

-- Define a UserMapper responsible for data access
UserMapper = {}
UserMapper.__index = UserMapper

function UserMapper:new(database)
    local mapper = setmetatable({}, UserMapper)
    mapper.database = database
    return mapper
end

function UserMapper:findById(id)
    -- Simulate a database query
    local userData = self.database:query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id)
    if userData then
        return User:new(userData.id, userData.name, userData.email)
    end
    return nil
end

function UserMapper:save(user)
    -- Simulate saving to the database
    self.database:execute("INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", user.id, user.name, user.email)
end
```

In this example, the `UserMapper` class is responsible for interacting with the database, while the `User` class remains unaware of how data is stored or retrieved.

#### Decoupling Domain Objects

One of the main advantages of the Data Mapper Pattern is the decoupling of domain objects from data storage. This decoupling allows for greater flexibility and easier testing, as domain objects can be tested independently of the database.

```lua
-- Test the User domain object independently
local user = User:new(1, "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
assert(user.name == "John Doe")

-- Test the UserMapper with a mock database
local mockDatabase = {
    query = function(_, query, id)
        if id == 1 then
            return {id = 1, name = "John Doe", email = "john.doe@example.com"}
        end
        return nil
    end,
    execute = function(_, query, id, name, email)
        print("User saved:", id, name, email)
    end
}

local userMapper = UserMapper:new(mockDatabase)
local retrievedUser = userMapper:findById(1)
assert(retrievedUser.name == "John Doe")
```

In this test, we use a mock database to verify the functionality of the `UserMapper` without relying on an actual database connection.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Complex Business Logic

The Data Mapper Pattern is ideal for applications with complex business logic that should not be tightly coupled to data storage. For instance, in a financial application, business rules and calculations can be encapsulated within domain objects, while data access is handled by mapper objects.

#### Applications Requiring Flexibility in Data Storage

Applications that require flexibility in data storage, such as those that may switch between different database systems, benefit greatly from the Data Mapper Pattern. By isolating data access logic within mapper objects, changes to the database schema or technology can be made with minimal impact on the domain logic.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Data Mapper Pattern in Lua, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Ensure that the data access logic is optimized for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Complexity**: While the pattern provides a clean separation of concerns, it can introduce additional complexity. Ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs in your specific use case.
- **Testing**: Take advantage of the decoupling to write comprehensive tests for both domain objects and mapper objects.

### Differences and Similarities

The Data Mapper Pattern is often compared to the Active Record Pattern. While both patterns deal with data access, they have distinct differences:

- **Data Mapper**: Separates data access logic from domain objects, providing greater flexibility and decoupling.
- **Active Record**: Combines data access logic with domain objects, simplifying implementation but potentially leading to tighter coupling.

### Visualizing the Data Mapper Pattern

To better understand the Data Mapper Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between domain objects, mapper objects, and the database.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +id: number
        +name: string
        +email: string
        +new(id, name, email)
    }

    class UserMapper {
        +database: Database
        +new(database)
        +findById(id)
        +save(user)
    }

    class Database {
        +query(query, params)
        +execute(query, params)
    }

    UserMapper --> User : maps
    UserMapper --> Database : interacts
```

In this diagram, the `UserMapper` class maps the `User` domain object to the `Database`, handling all data access logic.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Data Mapper Pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- Add additional fields to the `User` class and update the `UserMapper` to handle these fields.
- Implement additional methods in the `UserMapper`, such as `update` and `delete`.
- Experiment with different database backends by modifying the `mockDatabase` implementation.
