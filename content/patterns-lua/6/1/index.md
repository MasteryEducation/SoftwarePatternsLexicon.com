## 6.1 Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate effectively. In Lua, this pattern can be implemented using various techniques such as wrapper functions, adapter tables, and metatables. Let's delve into the details of the Adapter Pattern and explore how it can be effectively utilized in Lua programming.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter Pattern is to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern allows classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. By using an adapter, we can integrate third-party libraries, allow legacy code to interact with new systems, and convert data formats between different systems.

### Key Participants

1. **Target Interface**: The interface that the client expects.
2. **Adaptee**: The existing interface that needs adapting.
3. **Adapter**: The class that bridges the gap between the Target and the Adaptee.
4. **Client**: The entity that interacts with the Target interface.

### Implementing Adapter in Lua

#### Wrapper Functions

Wrapper functions are a straightforward way to implement the Adapter Pattern in Lua. These functions act as intermediaries that translate or map function calls from one interface to another.

```lua
-- Adaptee: The existing interface
local OldInterface = {}

function OldInterface.oldMethod()
    print("Old method executed")
end

-- Adapter: A wrapper function that adapts the old interface to the new one
local function newMethodAdapter()
    OldInterface.oldMethod()
end

-- Client: Using the new interface
newMethodAdapter()  -- Output: Old method executed
```

In this example, `newMethodAdapter` acts as an adapter that allows the client to use the `oldMethod` through a new interface.

#### Adapter Tables

Adapter tables use Lua's table data structure to represent objects and adapt their methods to match expected interfaces. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with multiple methods.

```lua
-- Adaptee: The existing interface
local OldInterface = {
    oldMethod1 = function() print("Old method 1 executed") end,
    oldMethod2 = function() print("Old method 2 executed") end
}

-- Adapter: A table that adapts the old interface to the new one
local Adapter = {
    newMethod1 = function() OldInterface.oldMethod1() end,
    newMethod2 = function() OldInterface.oldMethod2() end
}

-- Client: Using the new interface
Adapter.newMethod1()  -- Output: Old method 1 executed
Adapter.newMethod2()  -- Output: Old method 2 executed
```

Here, the `Adapter` table provides a new interface (`newMethod1` and `newMethod2`) that internally calls the methods of the `OldInterface`.

#### Metatables and Metamethods

Metatables and metamethods in Lua provide a powerful mechanism to intercept and redirect method calls, making them ideal for implementing the Adapter Pattern.

```lua
-- Adaptee: The existing interface
local OldInterface = {
    oldMethod = function() print("Old method executed") end
}

-- Adapter: Using metatables to adapt the old interface
local Adapter = {}
setmetatable(Adapter, {
    __index = function(_, key)
        if key == "newMethod" then
            return OldInterface.oldMethod
        end
    end
})

-- Client: Using the new interface
Adapter.newMethod()  -- Output: Old method executed
```

In this example, the `__index` metamethod is used to redirect calls to `newMethod` to the `oldMethod` of the `OldInterface`.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Integrating Third-Party Libraries

When integrating third-party libraries with different interfaces, the Adapter Pattern can be used to create a uniform interface for the client.

```lua
-- Third-party library with a different interface
local ThirdPartyLib = {
    execute = function() print("Third-party execution") end
}

-- Adapter: Adapting the third-party interface
local Adapter = {
    run = function() ThirdPartyLib.execute() end
}

-- Client: Using the adapted interface
Adapter.run()  -- Output: Third-party execution
```

#### Allowing Legacy Code to Interact with New Systems

Legacy systems often have interfaces that do not match modern requirements. The Adapter Pattern can bridge this gap.

```lua
-- Legacy system with an old interface
local LegacySystem = {
    legacyOperation = function() print("Legacy operation") end
}

-- Adapter: Adapting the legacy interface
local Adapter = {
    modernOperation = function() LegacySystem.legacyOperation() end
}

-- Client: Using the modern interface
Adapter.modernOperation()  -- Output: Legacy operation
```

#### Converting Data Formats Between Systems

The Adapter Pattern can also be used to convert data formats between different systems, ensuring compatibility.

```lua
-- System A with a specific data format
local SystemA = {
    getData = function() return {name = "Alice", age = 30} end
}

-- Adapter: Converting data format for System B
local Adapter = {
    getFormattedData = function()
        local data = SystemA.getData()
        return string.format("Name: %s, Age: %d", data.name, data.age)
    end
}

-- Client: Using the formatted data
print(Adapter.getFormattedData())  -- Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use the Adapter Pattern when you need to integrate incompatible interfaces, especially when dealing with legacy systems or third-party libraries.
- **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of using adapters, particularly when using metatables, as they may introduce overhead.
- **Complexity**: Avoid unnecessary complexity by using the simplest form of adapter that meets your needs, such as wrapper functions for straightforward adaptations.

### Differences and Similarities

The Adapter Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern, as both involve wrapping objects. However, the Adapter Pattern focuses on converting interfaces, while the Decorator Pattern adds new behavior to existing objects without altering their interface.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        +request()
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter o-- Adaptee
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the relationship between the Target, Adapter, and Adaptee. The Adapter implements the Target interface and holds a reference to the Adaptee, allowing it to convert calls to the Target's `request()` method into calls to the Adaptee's `specificRequest()` method.

### Try It Yourself
