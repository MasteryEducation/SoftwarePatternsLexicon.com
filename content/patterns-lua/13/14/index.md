## 13.14 Execution Sandboxing and Security

In the world of software development, running untrusted code safely is a critical concern. Whether you're developing an online code runner, a plugin system, or any application that executes user-submitted code, ensuring the security and integrity of your system is paramount. This section delves into the concepts of execution sandboxing and security in Lua, providing you with the tools and knowledge to isolate code execution environments effectively.

### Running Untrusted Code Safely

Running untrusted code involves executing code that originates from an external source, which may not be fully trusted. This can pose significant security risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, and resource exhaustion. To mitigate these risks, we employ execution sandboxing—a technique that isolates code execution environments to prevent malicious activities.

#### Implementing Sandboxes

A sandbox is a controlled environment where code can be executed with restricted permissions. In Lua, implementing a sandbox involves creating a secure execution environment that limits access to sensitive functions and resources.

##### Restricted Environments

To create a restricted environment, we need to limit the functions and libraries available to the untrusted code. This can be achieved by creating a custom environment table that only includes safe functions. Here's a basic example:

```lua
-- Define a safe environment
local safe_env = {
    print = print,  -- Allow printing
    math = math,    -- Allow math operations
}

-- Function to execute code in a sandbox
function execute_in_sandbox(code)
    local func, err = load(code, "sandbox", "t", safe_env)
    if not func then
        return nil, err
    end
    return pcall(func)
end

-- Example usage
local code = [[
    print("Hello, world!")
    return math.sqrt(16)
]]

local success, result = execute_in_sandbox(code)
if success then
    print("Result:", result)
else
    print("Error:", result)
end
```

In this example, we define a `safe_env` table that includes only the `print` function and the `math` library. The `execute_in_sandbox` function loads and executes the code within this restricted environment, preventing access to any other global functions or libraries.

##### Resource Limits

In addition to restricting the environment, it's crucial to control the execution time and memory usage of the untrusted code. This prevents resource exhaustion attacks, where malicious code consumes excessive CPU or memory resources.

Lua does not provide built-in mechanisms for setting resource limits, but you can achieve this by using external libraries or tools. For example, you can use the `lua-sandbox` library, which allows you to set execution time limits and memory usage restrictions.

### Security Measures

Implementing a sandbox is only part of the solution. We must also apply additional security measures to ensure the safety of our execution environment.

#### Preventing Escapes

One of the primary concerns when running untrusted code is preventing it from escaping the sandbox and accessing restricted resources. This involves securing metatables and global variables.

- **Securing Metatables**: Metatables can be used to override default behaviors in Lua. To prevent unauthorized modifications, ensure that metatables are not accessible from the sandboxed environment.
- **Securing Global Variables**: Limit access to global variables by using a custom environment table, as demonstrated in the previous example.

#### Input Validation

Before executing any code, it's essential to validate the input to ensure that only safe code is executed. This involves checking for potentially dangerous constructs, such as `os.execute` or `io.popen`, which can be used to execute system commands.

Here's an example of a simple input validation function:

```lua
-- Function to validate code input
function validate_code(code)
    local forbidden_patterns = {"os%.execute", "io%.popen"}
    for _, pattern in ipairs(forbidden_patterns) do
        if code:match(pattern) then
            return false, "Forbidden pattern detected: " .. pattern
        end
    end
    return true
end

-- Example usage
local code = [[
    print("Hello, world!")
    os.execute("rm -rf /")
]]

local is_valid, err = validate_code(code)
if not is_valid then
    print("Validation failed:", err)
else
    -- Execute code if valid
end
```

In this example, the `validate_code` function checks for forbidden patterns in the input code. If any are found, it returns an error message, preventing the code from being executed.

### Use Cases and Examples

Execution sandboxing and security are applicable in various scenarios, including online code runners and plugin systems.

#### Online Code Runners

Online code runners allow users to submit and execute code in a controlled environment. By implementing a sandbox, you can ensure that user-submitted code does not compromise the security of your system.

#### Plugin Systems

Plugin systems enable users to extend the functionality of an application by writing custom plugins. By sandboxing plugin execution, you can allow users to enhance your application without risking security breaches.

### Visualizing Execution Sandboxing

To better understand the concept of execution sandboxing, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Submits Code] --> B{Validate Code}
    B -->|Valid| C[Execute in Sandbox]
    B -->|Invalid| D[Reject Code]
    C --> E{Resource Limits}
    E -->|Within Limits| F[Return Result]
    E -->|Exceeded Limits| G[Terminate Execution]
```

**Figure 1**: This flowchart illustrates the process of executing user-submitted code in a sandbox. The code is first validated, then executed in a sandbox if valid. Resource limits are enforced during execution, and the result is returned if the execution completes within limits.

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding of execution sandboxing, try modifying the code examples provided. Experiment with different environment restrictions, input validation patterns, and resource limits. Consider creating a more complex sandbox that supports additional safe functions and libraries.
