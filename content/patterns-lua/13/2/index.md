## 13.2 Pattern Matching and Parsing

Pattern matching and parsing are fundamental techniques in programming, especially when dealing with text processing, data extraction, and language interpretation. Lua, with its lightweight and efficient design, offers powerful pattern matching capabilities that are both flexible and easy to use. In this section, we will delve into the world of Lua patterns, exploring basic and advanced techniques, and demonstrate how these can be applied in real-world scenarios.

### Using Lua Patterns: Matching and Extracting Information from Strings

Lua patterns are a powerful tool for matching and extracting information from strings. They are similar to regular expressions in other languages but are simpler and more intuitive. Lua patterns are used in functions like `string.match`, `string.find`, `string.gsub`, and `string.gmatch`.

#### Implementing Pattern Matching

##### Basic Patterns: Literals, Character Classes, and Quantifiers

**Literals** are the simplest form of patterns. They match the exact characters in a string. For example, the pattern `"hello"` will match the string `"hello"`.

**Character Classes** allow you to match any character from a set. They are defined using square brackets. For example, `[abc]` matches any of the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`. You can also specify ranges, such as `[a-z]` to match any lowercase letter.

**Quantifiers** specify how many times a character or character class should be matched. The most common quantifiers are `*` (zero or more times), `+` (one or more times), and `-` (zero or more times, non-greedy).

```lua
local text = "hello world"
-- Match the word 'hello'
local match = string.match(text, "hello")
print(match)  -- Output: hello

-- Match any lowercase letter
local match = string.match(text, "[a-z]+")
print(match)  -- Output: hello

-- Match one or more spaces
local match = string.match(text, "%s+")
print(match)  -- Output: (a single space)
```

##### Captures: Extracting Substrings from Matches

Captures are used to extract parts of the string that match a pattern. They are defined using parentheses. For example, the pattern `"(hello)"` will capture the word `"hello"`.

```lua
local text = "hello world"
-- Capture the word 'hello'
local match = string.match(text, "(hello)")
print(match)  -- Output: hello

-- Capture two words separated by a space
local word1, word2 = string.match(text, "(%w+)%s+(%w+)")
print(word1, word2)  -- Output: hello world
```

##### Advanced Patterns: Balanced Matches and Frontier Patterns

**Balanced Matches** are used to match nested structures, such as parentheses or brackets. Lua provides the `%b` pattern for this purpose. For example, `%b()` matches balanced parentheses.

```lua
local text = "a (b (c) d) e"
-- Match balanced parentheses
local match = string.match(text, "%b()")
print(match)  -- Output: (b (c) d)
```

**Frontier Patterns** are used to match patterns at word boundaries. They are defined using `%f[]`. For example, `%f[%w]` matches a word boundary.

```lua
local text = "hello world"
-- Match 'world' at a word boundary
local match = string.match(text, "%f[%w]world")
print(match)  -- Output: world
```

### Parsing Techniques

Parsing involves analyzing a string to extract meaningful information. It is often used in language interpreters, data processing, and configuration file parsing.

#### Tokenization: Breaking Strings into Meaningful Tokens

Tokenization is the process of breaking a string into smaller components, called tokens. Tokens can be words, numbers, or symbols. In Lua, tokenization can be achieved using pattern matching and string manipulation functions.

```lua
local text = "name=John age=30"
local tokens = {}
for token in string.gmatch(text, "%w+=") do
    table.insert(tokens, token)
end
for _, token in ipairs(tokens) do
    print(token)
end
-- Output:
-- name=
-- age=
```

#### Recursive Parsing: Handling Nested Structures

Recursive parsing is used to handle nested structures, such as mathematical expressions or nested data formats like JSON or XML. In Lua, recursive parsing can be implemented using recursive functions and pattern matching.

```lua
local function parse_expression(expression)
    local function parse_term(expr)
        return string.match(expr, "%b()") or string.match(expr, "%d+")
    end

    local function parse(expr)
        local term = parse_term(expr)
        if term then
            return term, string.sub(expr, #term + 1)
        end
    end

    local result, remainder = parse(expression)
    return result, remainder
end

local expression = "(3 + (2 * 5))"
local result, remainder = parse_expression(expression)
print(result)  -- Output: (3 + (2 * 5))
```

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Text Processing: Validating and Transforming Input

Pattern matching and parsing are commonly used in text processing to validate and transform input. For example, you can use patterns to validate email addresses, phone numbers, or other input formats.

```lua
local function validate_email(email)
    local pattern = "^[%w._%%-]+@[%w.-]+%.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$"
    return string.match(email, pattern) ~= nil
end

print(validate_email("test@example.com"))  -- Output: true
print(validate_email("invalid-email"))     -- Output: false
```

#### Language Interpreters: Parsing Code or Configuration Files

Pattern matching and parsing are essential in language interpreters for parsing code or configuration files. They allow you to extract and interpret commands, parameters, and values.

```lua
local function parse_config(config)
    local settings = {}
    for key, value in string.gmatch(config, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do
        settings[key] = value
    end
    return settings
end

local config = "host=localhost port=8080"
local settings = parse_config(config)
for key, value in pairs(settings) do
    print(key, value)
end
-- Output:
-- host localhost
-- port 8080
```

### Visualizing Pattern Matching and Parsing

To better understand the flow of pattern matching and parsing, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[Input String]
    B --> C{Pattern Matching}
    C -->|Match Found| D[Extract Data]
    C -->|No Match| E[End]
    D --> F{Parsing}
    F -->|Valid| G[Process Data]
    F -->|Invalid| H[Error Handling]
    G --> E
    H --> E
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided in this section. Try modifying the patterns to match different strings or extract different parts of the input. For example, you can:

- Modify the email validation pattern to allow additional domains.
- Extend the configuration parser to handle more complex settings.
- Implement a simple calculator that parses and evaluates mathematical expressions.
