## 8.5 Table Manipulation Patterns

Tables are the cornerstone of data manipulation in Lua, serving as arrays, dictionaries, and even objects. Mastering table manipulation patterns is crucial for any Lua developer aiming to write efficient and elegant code. In this section, we will explore common techniques for working with tables, including copying, filtering, mapping, and merging. These patterns are essential for data transformation, generating new datasets, and implementing collection utilities.

### Working with Tables Efficiently

#### Common Techniques

#### Table Copying and Cloning

Copying tables in Lua can be categorized into two types: shallow copying and deep copying. Understanding the difference between these two is essential for managing data integrity and memory usage.

**Shallow Copying**

A shallow copy of a table creates a new table with references to the same elements as the original table. This means that changes to nested tables will affect both the original and the copied table.

```lua
function shallowCopy(original)
    local copy = {}
    for key, value in pairs(original) do
        copy[key] = value
    end
    return copy
end

-- Example usage
local originalTable = {1, 2, {3, 4}}
local copiedTable = shallowCopy(originalTable)

-- Modifying the nested table
copiedTable[3][1] = 5

print(originalTable[3][1]) -- Output: 5
```

**Deep Copying**

A deep copy creates a new table with copies of all nested tables, ensuring that changes to the copied table do not affect the original table.

```lua
function deepCopy(original)
    local copy
    if type(original) == 'table' then
        copy = {}
        for key, value in next, original, nil do
            copy[deepCopy(key)] = deepCopy(value)
        end
        setmetatable(copy, deepCopy(getmetatable(original)))
    else
        copy = original
    end
    return copy
end

-- Example usage
local originalTable = {1, 2, {3, 4}}
local copiedTable = deepCopy(originalTable)

-- Modifying the nested table
copiedTable[3][1] = 5

print(originalTable[3][1]) -- Output: 3
```

#### Filtering and Mapping

Filtering and mapping are powerful techniques for transforming tables. Filtering involves selecting elements that meet certain criteria, while mapping involves applying a function to each element to create a new table.

**Filtering**

```lua
function filterTable(tbl, predicate)
    local filtered = {}
    for i, value in ipairs(tbl) do
        if predicate(value) then
            table.insert(filtered, value)
        end
    end
    return filtered
end

-- Example usage
local numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
local evenNumbers = filterTable(numbers, function(n) return n % 2 == 0 end)

for _, v in ipairs(evenNumbers) do
    print(v) -- Output: 2, 4
end
```

**Mapping**

```lua
function mapTable(tbl, func)
    local mapped = {}
    for i, value in ipairs(tbl) do
        mapped[i] = func(value)
    end
    return mapped
end

-- Example usage
local numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
local squaredNumbers = mapTable(numbers, function(n) return n * n end)

for _, v in ipairs(squaredNumbers) do
    print(v) -- Output: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
end
```

#### Merging Tables

Merging tables involves combining multiple tables into one. This can be useful for aggregating data from different sources or creating a unified dataset.

```lua
function mergeTables(...)
    local merged = {}
    for i = 1, select('#', ...) do
        local tbl = select(i, ...)
        for k, v in pairs(tbl) do
            merged[k] = v
        end
    end
    return merged
end

-- Example usage
local table1 = {a = 1, b = 2}
local table2 = {b = 3, c = 4}
local mergedTable = mergeTables(table1, table2)

for k, v in pairs(mergedTable) do
    print(k, v) -- Output: a 1, b 3, c 4
end
```

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Data Transformation

Table manipulation patterns are essential for transforming data into desired formats. For instance, you might need to filter out unwanted data, map values to a new format, or merge datasets from different sources.

#### Generating New Datasets

By applying filtering and mapping techniques, you can generate new datasets that meet specific criteria or formats. This is particularly useful in data analysis and processing tasks.

#### Implementing Collection Utilities

Table manipulation patterns can be used to implement utility functions for collections, such as finding the maximum or minimum value, sorting, or aggregating data.

### Visualizing Table Manipulation Patterns

To better understand how these patterns work, let's visualize the process of filtering and mapping a table using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Original Table];
    B --> C{Filter Predicate};
    C -->|True| D[Filtered Table];
    C -->|False| B;
    D --> E{Mapping Function};
    E --> F[Mapped Table];
    F --> G[End];
```

This flowchart illustrates the process of filtering a table based on a predicate and then mapping the filtered results to create a new table.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying the filtering and mapping functions. Try creating a function that filters out odd numbers and then maps the remaining numbers to their cube.
