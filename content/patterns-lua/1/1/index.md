## 1.1 What Are Design Patterns?

### Definition and Purpose

Design patterns are a crucial concept in software engineering, offering reusable solutions to common problems encountered during software design. They provide a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. By using design patterns, developers can create more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.

In essence, design patterns are about capturing design expertise in a form that can be reused. They allow developers to communicate using well-understood names for software interactions, making it easier to discuss potential solutions and their trade-offs. This shared vocabulary can significantly enhance collaboration and understanding within development teams.

### Historical Context

The concept of design patterns in software engineering was popularized by the "Gang of Four" (GoF) book, *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, published in 1994. The authors—Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides—introduced 23 classic design patterns that have since become a cornerstone of software development.

The idea of design patterns, however, originated from the field of architecture. Christopher Alexander, an architect, introduced the concept of patterns in his book *A Pattern Language*, which described a set of design solutions for common architectural problems. The GoF adapted these ideas to software engineering, recognizing that similar patterns could be applied to recurring problems in software design.

### Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are generally categorized into three main types: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Each category addresses a different aspect of software design.

#### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation process.

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

#### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.

- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
- **Bridge Pattern**: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

#### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help make the interaction between objects more flexible and efficient.

- **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing each handler to either process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.
- **Mediator Pattern**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- **Memento Pattern**: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor Pattern**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

### Code Examples

To better understand how design patterns work, let's look at a simple example using the Singleton pattern in Lua. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

```lua
-- Singleton Pattern in Lua

local Singleton = {}
Singleton.__index = Singleton

-- Private variable to hold the single instance
local instance

-- Private constructor
local function new()
    local self = setmetatable({}, Singleton)
    -- Initialize your instance variables here
    self.value = 0
    return self
end

-- Public method to get the single instance
function Singleton:getInstance()
    if not instance then
        instance = new()
    end
    return instance
end

-- Example usage
local singleton1 = Singleton:getInstance()
singleton1.value = 10

local singleton2 = Singleton:getInstance()
print(singleton2.value)  -- Output: 10, proving both are the same instance
```

**Try It Yourself**: Modify the Singleton pattern to include a method that increments the `value` by a given number. Test it by calling this method from different instances and observe the changes.

### Visualizing Design Patterns

To help visualize how design patterns fit into software architecture, consider the following diagram that illustrates the relationship between different types of design patterns and their roles in software design.
