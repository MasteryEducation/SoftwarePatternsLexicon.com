10. **Embrace the Journey**: Remember that mastering Lua design patterns is a journey. Stay curious, keep experimenting, and enjoy the process of learning and discovery.

### Code Examples and Visualizations

Throughout this guide, you will encounter numerous code examples and visualizations designed to illustrate key concepts and patterns. Here is a sample code snippet demonstrating a simple Lua function:

```lua
-- Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n)
    if n == 0 then
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
end

-- Test the factorial function
print(factorial(5))  -- Output: 120
```

**Try It Yourself**: Modify the `factorial` function to handle negative numbers gracefully. Consider adding error handling to provide informative messages for invalid inputs.

In addition to code examples, the guide includes visualizations created using Mermaid.js to enhance your understanding of complex concepts. For example, here is a flowchart illustrating the control flow of the `factorial` function:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is n == 0?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return 1]
    B -- No --> D[Calculate n * factorial(n - 1)]
    D --> E[Return result]
    C --> F[End]
    E --> F
```
