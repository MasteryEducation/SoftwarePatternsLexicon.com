### Code Examples and Visualizations

To enhance your understanding of Lua design patterns, let's explore some code examples and visualizations.

#### Singleton Pattern in Lua

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

```lua
-- Singleton Pattern Example in Lua
local Singleton = {}
Singleton.__index = Singleton

function Singleton:new()
    if not Singleton.instance then
        Singleton.instance = setmetatable({}, Singleton)
    end
    return Singleton.instance
end

-- Usage
local instance1 = Singleton:new()
local instance2 = Singleton:new()

print(instance1 == instance2) -- Output: true
```

> **Explanation:** The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. In this example, `Singleton:new()` checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates one. Subsequent calls return the existing instance.

#### Visualizing the Singleton Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -instance: Singleton
        +new(): Singleton
    }
    Singleton : +getInstance() Singleton
```

> **Description:** This class diagram illustrates the Singleton pattern, showing the single instance and the method to access it.

### Knowledge Check

Let's reinforce your learning with some questions and exercises.

- **Question:** What is the primary purpose of the Singleton pattern?
- **Exercise:** Modify the Singleton pattern example to include a method that returns the instance's creation timestamp.

### Embrace the Journey

Remember, mastering Lua design patterns is a journey. As you explore these resources and engage with the community, you'll gain valuable insights and skills. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the process of learning and growing as a Lua developer.
