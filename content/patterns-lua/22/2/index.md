### Visualizing Design Patterns

To enhance your understanding of design patterns, it is beneficial to visualize them using diagrams. Below is an example of a class diagram for the Singleton pattern, a common design pattern used in Lua.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        - instance: Singleton
        + getInstance(): Singleton
    }
```

**Description**: This diagram illustrates the Singleton pattern, where a class has a single instance that is accessed through a static method.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Singleton pattern, try modifying the code example below to implement a thread-safe Singleton in Lua.

```lua
-- Singleton pattern in Lua
local Singleton = {}
Singleton.__index = Singleton

local instance = nil

function Singleton:new()
    if not instance then
        instance = setmetatable({}, Singleton)
    end
    return instance
end

-- Usage
local singleton1 = Singleton:new()
local singleton2 = Singleton:new()

print(singleton1 == singleton2)  -- Output: true
```

**Challenge**: Modify the `Singleton:new()` method to ensure thread safety when creating the instance.

### Knowledge Check

To reinforce your learning, consider the following questions:

1. What are the key benefits of using design patterns in Lua?
2. How does the Singleton pattern ensure only one instance of a class is created?
3. What are some common pitfalls when implementing design patterns in Lua?

### Embrace the Journey

Remember, mastering design patterns in Lua is a journey. As you explore these resources, keep experimenting and applying what you learn. Stay curious, and don't hesitate to reach out to the Lua community for support and collaboration.
