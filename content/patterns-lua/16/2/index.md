## 16.2 Input Validation and Sanitization

In the realm of software security, input validation and sanitization are critical practices that safeguard applications from malicious attacks. Lua, a versatile scripting language, is no exception when it comes to the need for robust input handling mechanisms. This section delves into the principles and techniques of input validation and sanitization in Lua, focusing on protecting against injection attacks such as SQL injection and code injection.

### Protecting Against Injection Attacks

Injection attacks are a prevalent threat in software applications, where an attacker provides untrusted input to manipulate the execution of a program. Common types of injection attacks include SQL injection, code injection, and command injection. These attacks can lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption, and even complete system compromise.

#### SQL Injection

SQL injection occurs when an attacker inserts or "injects" malicious SQL code into a query. This can lead to unauthorized access to or manipulation of the database. Consider the following example:

```lua
-- Vulnerable SQL query construction
local user_input = "1; DROP TABLE users;" -- Malicious input
local query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " .. user_input
```

In this example, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating the `user_input`.

#### Code Injection

Code injection involves inserting malicious code into a program, which is then executed by the application. This can occur in Lua scripts if user input is directly executed as code.

```lua
-- Vulnerable code execution
local user_input = "os.execute('rm -rf /')" -- Malicious input
load(user_input)()
```

In this scenario, the attacker can execute harmful system commands.

### Implementing Input Validation

Input validation is the process of ensuring that user input conforms to expected formats and values. It is the first line of defense against injection attacks.

#### Whitelist Approach

The whitelist approach involves accepting only known good inputs. This method is more secure than blacklisting, which attempts to block known bad inputs. By defining a set of acceptable values or patterns, you can prevent unexpected or harmful input.

```lua
-- Whitelist validation example
local function is_valid_input(input)
    local valid_inputs = { "1", "2", "3", "4", "5" }
    for _, v in ipairs(valid_inputs) do
        if input == v then
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end

local user_input = "3"
if is_valid_input(user_input) then
    print("Valid input")
else
    print("Invalid input")
end
```

In this example, only inputs that match the predefined list are considered valid.

#### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are powerful tools for validating input formats. Lua provides pattern matching capabilities that can be used to enforce input constraints.

```lua
-- Regular expression validation example
local function is_valid_email(email)
    local pattern = "^[%w._%+-]+@[%w.-]+%.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$"
    return string.match(email, pattern) ~= nil
end

local email_input = "user@example.com"
if is_valid_email(email_input) then
    print("Valid email")
else
    print("Invalid email")
end
```

This code snippet uses a Lua pattern to validate email addresses, ensuring they conform to a standard format.

### Sanitizing Inputs

Sanitization involves cleaning input data to remove or neutralize harmful content. It complements validation by ensuring that even valid inputs cannot be used maliciously.

#### Escaping Special Characters

Escaping special characters is crucial when constructing database queries or executing system commands. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code.

```lua
-- Escaping special characters for SQL queries
local function escape_sql(input)
    return input:gsub("'", "''")
end

local user_input = "O'Reilly"
local query = "SELECT * FROM books WHERE author = '" .. escape_sql(user_input) .. "'"
```

In this example, single quotes in the input are escaped to prevent SQL injection.

#### Removing Malicious Content

In addition to escaping, you may need to filter out harmful scripts or code from user input. This is especially important for web applications that process HTML or JavaScript.

```lua
-- Removing malicious content
local function sanitize_html(input)
    return input:gsub("<", "&lt;"):gsub(">", "&gt;")
end

local user_input = "<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>"
local safe_input = sanitize_html(user_input)
```

This code replaces HTML tags with their escaped equivalents, preventing script execution.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Web Form Processing

Web forms are common sources of user input. Proper validation and sanitization are essential to prevent attacks.

```lua
-- Web form processing example
local function process_form(data)
    if not is_valid_email(data.email) then
        return "Invalid email address"
    end
    local safe_name = sanitize_html(data.name)
    -- Further processing...
end

local form_data = { email = "user@example.com", name = "<b>John</b>" }
process_form(form_data)
```

This example demonstrates secure handling of form data by validating email addresses and sanitizing names.

#### Command Execution

When building interfaces that execute system commands, it's vital to validate and sanitize inputs to prevent command injection.

```lua
-- Secure command execution example
local function execute_command(command)
    local safe_command = escape_sql(command) -- Example of escaping
    os.execute(safe_command)
end

local user_command = "ls -la"
execute_command(user_command)
```

By escaping special characters, you can mitigate the risk of executing unintended commands.

### Visualizing Input Validation and Sanitization

To better understand the flow of input validation and sanitization, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.
