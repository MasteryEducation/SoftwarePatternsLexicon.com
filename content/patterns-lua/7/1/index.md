## 7.1 Strategy Pattern

In the realm of software design, flexibility and reusability are paramount. The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to switch between different algorithms or behaviors at runtime without altering the clients that use them. In this section, we will delve into the Strategy Pattern in Lua, exploring its implementation, use cases, and benefits.

### Intent of the Strategy Pattern

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to encapsulate algorithms within separate objects, allowing them to be interchangeable. This pattern promotes the open/closed principle, enabling new algorithms to be added without modifying existing code. By decoupling the algorithm from the client, the Strategy Pattern enhances flexibility and maintainability.

### Key Participants

1. **Strategy Interface**: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: Implement the strategy interface, providing specific algorithms.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to the strategy.

### Implementing Strategy in Lua

Lua, with its dynamic typing and first-class functions, provides a flexible environment for implementing the Strategy Pattern. Let's explore how to create strategy objects, a context object, and switch strategies at runtime.

#### Strategy Objects

In Lua, strategy objects can be implemented as functions or tables. Each strategy encapsulates a specific algorithm.

```lua
-- Define strategy functions
local function bubbleSort(data)
    -- Implementation of bubble sort algorithm
    for i = 1, #data do
        for j = 1, #data - i do
            if data[j] > data[j + 1] then
                data[j], data[j + 1] = data[j + 1], data[j]
            end
        end
    end
    return data
end

local function quickSort(data)
    -- Implementation of quick sort algorithm
    if #data < 2 then return data end
    local pivot = data[1]
    local less, greater = {}, {}
    for i = 2, #data do
        if data[i] <= pivot then
            table.insert(less, data[i])
        else
            table.insert(greater, data[i])
        end
    end
    return quickSort(less), pivot, quickSort(greater)
end
```

#### Context Object

The context object holds a reference to a strategy and delegates the execution of the algorithm to the strategy.

```lua
-- Context object
local SortContext = {}
SortContext.__index = SortContext

function SortContext:new(strategy)
    local obj = { strategy = strategy }
    setmetatable(obj, self)
    return obj
end

function SortContext:executeStrategy(data)
    return self.strategy(data)
end
```

#### Switching Strategies

Switching strategies at runtime is straightforward in Lua. You can change the strategy by assigning a different function to the context's strategy attribute.

```lua
-- Example usage
local data = {5, 3, 8, 4, 2}

-- Create a context with bubble sort strategy
local context = SortContext:new(bubbleSort)
print("Bubble Sort:", table.concat(context:executeStrategy(data), ", "))

-- Switch to quick sort strategy
context.strategy = quickSort
print("Quick Sort:", table.concat(context:executeStrategy(data), ", "))
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Strategy Pattern is versatile and applicable in various scenarios. Let's explore some common use cases.

#### Selecting Sorting Algorithms Based on Data Size

In applications where data size varies significantly, you can use the Strategy Pattern to select the most efficient sorting algorithm dynamically.

```lua
-- Function to choose strategy based on data size
local function chooseSortingStrategy(data)
    if #data < 10 then
        return bubbleSort
    else
        return quickSort
    end
end

-- Example usage
local data = {5, 3, 8, 4, 2}
local strategy = chooseSortingStrategy(data)
local context = SortContext:new(strategy)
print("Sorted Data:", table.concat(context:executeStrategy(data), ", "))
```

#### Configurable AI Behaviors in Games

In game development, AI behaviors can be encapsulated as strategies, allowing for dynamic changes in behavior based on game state or player actions.

```lua
-- Define AI behavior strategies
local function aggressiveAI()
    print("AI is playing aggressively.")
end

local function defensiveAI()
    print("AI is playing defensively.")
end

-- Context for AI behavior
local AIContext = {}
AIContext.__index = AIContext

function AIContext:new(strategy)
    local obj = { strategy = strategy }
    setmetatable(obj, self)
    return obj
end

function AIContext:executeStrategy()
    self.strategy()
end

-- Example usage
local aiContext = AIContext:new(aggressiveAI)
aiContext:executeStrategy()

-- Switch to defensive strategy
aiContext.strategy = defensiveAI
aiContext:executeStrategy()
```

#### Payment Processing with Different Methods

In e-commerce applications, payment processing can be handled using different strategies, such as credit card, PayPal, or cryptocurrency.

```lua
-- Define payment strategies
local function creditCardPayment(amount)
    print("Processing credit card payment of $" .. amount)
end

local function paypalPayment(amount)
    print("Processing PayPal payment of $" .. amount)
end

-- Context for payment processing
local PaymentContext = {}
PaymentContext.__index = PaymentContext

function PaymentContext:new(strategy)
    local obj = { strategy = strategy }
    setmetatable(obj, self)
    return obj
end

function PaymentContext:executeStrategy(amount)
    self.strategy(amount)
end

-- Example usage
local paymentContext = PaymentContext:new(creditCardPayment)
paymentContext:executeStrategy(100)

-- Switch to PayPal strategy
paymentContext.strategy = paypalPayment
paymentContext:executeStrategy(200)
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Strategy Pattern, consider the following:

- **Interface Consistency**: Ensure all strategies implement a consistent interface to facilitate easy switching.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of the performance overhead associated with strategy switching, especially in performance-critical applications.
- **Extensibility**: The Strategy Pattern is highly extensible, allowing new strategies to be added with minimal impact on existing code.

### Differences and Similarities

The Strategy Pattern is often confused with the State Pattern. While both involve changing behavior at runtime, the Strategy Pattern focuses on interchangeable algorithms, whereas the State Pattern deals with state-dependent behavior.

### Visualizing Strategy Pattern

To better understand the Strategy Pattern, let's visualize its components and interactions using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        - Strategy strategy
        + executeStrategy(data)
    }
    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        + algorithmInterface(data)
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        + algorithmInterface(data)
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        + algorithmInterface(data)
    }
    Context --> Strategy
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
```

**Diagram Description**: The class diagram illustrates the relationship between the Context and Strategy classes. The Context holds a reference to a Strategy and delegates the algorithm execution to it. Concrete strategies implement the Strategy interface, providing specific algorithms.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Strategy Pattern by modifying the code examples. Try implementing additional sorting algorithms or AI behaviors, and switch between them dynamically. Consider creating a new context for a different application, such as image processing or data compression.
