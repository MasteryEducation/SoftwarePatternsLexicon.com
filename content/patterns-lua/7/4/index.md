## 7.4 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

In the realm of software design patterns, the Chain of Responsibility pattern stands out as a powerful tool for managing complex request processing scenarios. This pattern allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers, each with the opportunity to process the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain. This approach promotes loose coupling and enhances flexibility in the design of systems where multiple objects can handle a request.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to decouple the sender of a request from its receivers by allowing multiple objects to handle the request. This pattern provides a way to process requests without explicitly specifying the receiver, enabling a more dynamic and flexible handling mechanism.

### Key Participants

1. **Handler**: Defines an interface for handling requests and optionally maintains a reference to the next handler in the chain.
2. **ConcreteHandler**: Implements the handler interface and processes requests it is responsible for. If it cannot handle a request, it forwards the request to the next handler.
3. **Client**: Initiates the request to a handler object in the chain.

### Implementing Chain of Responsibility in Lua

In Lua, implementing the Chain of Responsibility pattern involves creating handler objects, each with a reference to the next handler. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain.

#### Handler Objects

Let's begin by defining a simple handler interface in Lua. Each handler will have a method to set the next handler and a method to process the request.

```lua
-- Define a Handler interface
Handler = {}
Handler.__index = Handler

function Handler:new()
    local instance = setmetatable({}, self)
    instance.nextHandler = nil
    return instance
end

function Handler:setNext(handler)
    self.nextHandler = handler
end

function Handler:handleRequest(request)
    -- Default implementation: pass the request to the next handler
    if self.nextHandler then
        self.nextHandler:handleRequest(request)
    end
end
```

#### Concrete Handlers

Next, we create concrete handlers that implement the `handleRequest` method. Each handler will decide whether to process the request or pass it on.

```lua
-- ConcreteHandler1 processes requests of type "Type1"
ConcreteHandler1 = setmetatable({}, {__index = Handler})

function ConcreteHandler1:handleRequest(request)
    if request.type == "Type1" then
        print("ConcreteHandler1 handled request of Type1")
    else
        Handler.handleRequest(self, request)
    end
end

-- ConcreteHandler2 processes requests of type "Type2"
ConcreteHandler2 = setmetatable({}, {__index = Handler})

function ConcreteHandler2:handleRequest(request)
    if request.type == "Type2" then
        print("ConcreteHandler2 handled request of Type2")
    else
        Handler.handleRequest(self, request)
    end
end
```

#### Client Code

Finally, we set up the chain of handlers and initiate a request.

```lua
-- Create handlers
local handler1 = ConcreteHandler1:new()
local handler2 = ConcreteHandler2:new()

-- Set up the chain
handler1:setNext(handler2)

-- Create a request
local request = {type = "Type2"}

-- Start the request processing
handler1:handleRequest(request)
```

In this example, the request of type "Type2" is passed along the chain until it is handled by `ConcreteHandler2`.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects can handle a request, and the handler is not known in advance. Here are some common use cases:

#### Event Bubbling in UI Systems

In user interface systems, events such as mouse clicks or keyboard inputs can be passed along a chain of UI components. Each component has the opportunity to handle the event or pass it on to the next component. This approach allows for flexible event handling and reduces the coupling between UI components.

#### Logging with Multiple Loggers

In logging systems, a log message can be passed along a chain of loggers, each responsible for logging messages to different destinations (e.g., console, file, network). Each logger can decide whether to log the message or pass it on to the next logger.

#### Access Control Checks

In access control systems, a request for access can be passed along a chain of security checks. Each check can decide whether to grant access or pass the request on to the next check. This approach allows for flexible and extensible access control mechanisms.

### Visualizing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

To better understand the flow of requests in the Chain of Responsibility pattern, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Handler1
    participant Handler2
    participant Handler3

    Client->>Handler1: handleRequest(request)
    Handler1->>Handler2: handleRequest(request)
    Handler2->>Handler3: handleRequest(request)
    Handler3-->>Client: Request handled
```

In this diagram, the client sends a request to `Handler1`, which passes it to `Handler2`, and then to `Handler3`, where it is finally handled.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Chain of Responsibility pattern, consider the following:

- **Order of Handlers**: The order in which handlers are arranged in the chain can affect the outcome. Ensure the order aligns with the desired processing logic.
- **Termination**: Ensure that the chain has a termination condition to prevent infinite loops.
- **Responsibility**: Clearly define the responsibility of each handler to avoid overlap and ensure efficient processing.

### Differences and Similarities

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is often compared to other behavioral patterns such as the Command and Observer patterns. While all these patterns deal with request handling, the Chain of Responsibility pattern is unique in its ability to pass requests along a chain of handlers, allowing for dynamic and flexible processing.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Chain of Responsibility pattern, try modifying the code examples provided:

- Add a new handler that processes requests of a different type.
- Change the order of handlers in the chain and observe the effect on request processing.
- Implement a logging system using the Chain of Responsibility pattern, where each logger logs messages to a different destination.
