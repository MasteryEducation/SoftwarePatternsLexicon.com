## 4.2. Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to work together seamlessly. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating new components into an existing system or when adapting legacy code to meet new requirements.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Adapter Pattern is to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This conversion allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together without modifying their source code. By using an adapter, we can achieve the following:

- **Interface Compatibility**: Enable classes with incompatible interfaces to communicate and collaborate.
- **Reusability**: Reuse existing classes without altering their code, thus preserving their integrity.
- **Flexibility**: Allow systems to evolve and incorporate new functionalities without extensive refactoring.

### Applicability

The Adapter Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You want to use an existing class, but its interface does not match the one you need.
- You need to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.
- You want to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.

### Structure

The Adapter Pattern can be implemented in two main forms: **Class Adapter** and **Object Adapter**.

#### Class Adapter

A Class Adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another. It inherits interfaces from both the target and the adaptee. This form is less common in languages that do not support multiple inheritance.

#### Object Adapter

An Object Adapter relies on object composition. It contains an instance of the class it wraps and delegates calls to the adaptee. This form is more flexible and widely used.

Below is a UML diagram illustrating the structure of the Adapter Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        +request()
    }

    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }

    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }

    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter o-- Adaptee
```

**Diagram Description**: The `Target` class defines the domain-specific interface that `Client` uses. `Adaptee` is the existing interface that needs adapting. `Adapter` makes `Adaptee`'s interface compatible with `Target`.

### Participants and Collaborations

- **Target**: Defines the domain-specific interface that `Client` uses.
- **Client**: Collaborates with objects conforming to the `Target` interface.
- **Adaptee**: Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
- **Adapter**: Adapts the interface of `Adaptee` to the `Target` interface.

### Consequences

#### Class Adapter vs. Object Adapter

- **Class Adapter**:
  - Pros: Can override `Adaptee` behavior since it is a subclass.
  - Cons: Requires multiple inheritance, which is not supported in all languages.

- **Object Adapter**:
  - Pros: More flexible, as it can work with any subclass of `Adaptee`.
  - Cons: Cannot override `Adaptee` behavior.

### Implementation Considerations

#### Adapting Legacy Code

When adapting legacy code, consider the following:

- **Minimize Changes**: Use the adapter to minimize changes to the existing codebase.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure that the adapter is easy to maintain and understand.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of any performance overhead introduced by the adapter.

### Detailed Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a detailed pseudocode implementation of the Adapter Pattern using the Object Adapter approach.

```pseudocode
// Target interface
interface Target {
    method request()
}

// Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class Adaptee {
    method specificRequest()
        // Implementation of specific request
}

// Adapter class that makes Adaptee compatible with Target
class Adapter implements Target {
    private adaptee: Adaptee

    constructor Adapter(adaptee: Adaptee)
        this.adaptee = adaptee

    method request()
        // Translate the request to the specificRequest
        this.adaptee.specificRequest()
}

// Client code
function main()
    adaptee = new Adaptee()
    adapter = new Adapter(adaptee)
    adapter.request()
```

**Explanation**: In this pseudocode, the `Adapter` class implements the `Target` interface and holds an instance of `Adaptee`. The `request` method in `Adapter` translates the call to `specificRequest` in `Adaptee`.

### Example Usage Scenarios

- **Integrating Third-Party Libraries**: When integrating a third-party library that does not match your application's interface, use an adapter to bridge the gap.
- **Refactoring Legacy Systems**: When refactoring legacy systems, use adapters to introduce new functionalities without altering existing code.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: In cross-platform development, adapters can help unify different platform-specific interfaces into a single, consistent interface.

### Exercises

1. **Exercise 1**: Implement a class adapter for a scenario where multiple inheritance is possible. Compare its advantages and disadvantages with the object adapter approach.
2. **Exercise 2**: Create an adapter for a third-party library in a hypothetical application. Discuss the challenges faced and how the adapter resolves them.
3. **Exercise 3**: Refactor a legacy system using the Adapter Pattern. Identify areas where adapters can improve code maintainability and flexibility.

### Visual Aids

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between the client, adapter, and adaptee:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Adapter
    participant Adaptee

    Client->>Adapter: request()
    Adapter->>Adaptee: specificRequest()
    Adaptee-->>Adapter: return
    Adapter-->>Client: return
```

**Diagram Description**: The sequence diagram shows the flow of a request from the `Client` to the `Adapter`, which then delegates the request to the `Adaptee`.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the pseudocode examples:

- **Experiment 1**: Add additional methods to the `Adaptee` class and modify the `Adapter` to support these methods.
- **Experiment 2**: Implement error handling in the adapter to manage potential issues when calling `Adaptee` methods.
- **Experiment 3**: Create a new `Target` interface with additional methods and adapt the existing `Adaptee` to this new interface.
