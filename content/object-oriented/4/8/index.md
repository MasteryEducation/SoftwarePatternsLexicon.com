## 4.8. Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to perform additional operations whenever an object is accessed, such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Proxy Pattern is to provide a substitute for another object, allowing you to control access to it. This can be motivated by several factors:

- **Remote Proxy**: Represents an object in a different address space. It is used to hide the fact that an object resides in a different location.
- **Virtual Proxy**: Controls access to a resource that is expensive to create. It can delay the creation and initialization of the resource until it is needed.
- **Protection Proxy**: Controls access to the original object based on access rights. It can be used to add a layer of security.
- **Smart Reference**: Provides additional functionality, such as reference counting or logging, when accessing an object.

### Applicability

Consider using the Proxy Pattern when:

- You need to control access to an object.
- You want to add a layer of security or access control.
- You need to manage the lifecycle of a resource, such as lazy loading or caching.
- You want to add additional functionality to an object without modifying its code.

### Structure

The Proxy Pattern involves the following key components:

- **Subject**: The common interface for RealSubject and Proxy, allowing Proxy to be used anywhere RealSubject is expected.
- **RealSubject**: The actual object that the proxy represents.
- **Proxy**: The object that controls access to the RealSubject. It implements the same interface as RealSubject and maintains a reference to it.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        <<interface>>
        +request()
    }
    class RealSubject {
        +request()
    }
    class Proxy {
        -realSubject: RealSubject
        +request()
    }
    Subject <|.. RealSubject
    Subject <|.. Proxy
    Proxy --> RealSubject
```

### Participants and Collaborations

- **Subject**: Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
- **RealSubject**: The actual object that the Proxy represents.
- **Proxy**: Maintains a reference to the RealSubject and controls access to it. The Proxy can perform additional operations before or after forwarding a request to the RealSubject.

### Consequences

The Proxy Pattern offers several benefits and trade-offs:

- **Advantages**:
  - **Controlled Access**: Proxies can control access to the RealSubject, adding security or access control.
  - **Lazy Initialization**: Virtual proxies can delay the creation of expensive objects until they are needed.
  - **Additional Functionality**: Proxies can add functionality, such as logging or caching, without modifying the RealSubject.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Overhead**: Introducing a proxy can add overhead, especially if the proxy performs complex operations.
  - **Complexity**: The pattern can introduce additional complexity into the system, particularly if multiple proxies are used.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing the Proxy Pattern, consider the following:

- **Overhead and Performance**: Ensure that the proxy does not introduce significant overhead, especially if it is used frequently.
- **Thread Safety**: If the proxy is used in a multithreaded environment, ensure that it is thread-safe.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that the proxy maintains consistent behavior with the RealSubject, so clients are unaware of the proxy's presence.

### Detailed Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a detailed pseudocode implementation of the Proxy Pattern. We'll use a simple example of a virtual proxy that controls access to an expensive resource.

```pseudocode
// Define the Subject interface
interface Subject {
    method request()
}

// Implement the RealSubject class
class RealSubject implements Subject {
    method request() {
        // Perform the actual operation
        print("RealSubject: Handling request.")
    }
}

// Implement the Proxy class
class Proxy implements Subject {
    private realSubject: RealSubject

    method request() {
        if (realSubject == null) {
            // Lazy initialization of the real subject
            realSubject = new RealSubject()
        }
        // Forward the request to the real subject
        realSubject.request()
    }
}

// Client code
function main() {
    proxy: Subject = new Proxy()
    // Use the proxy to access the real subject
    proxy.request()
}
```

In this example, the `Proxy` class controls access to the `RealSubject`. The `request` method in the `Proxy` class initializes the `RealSubject` only when it is needed, demonstrating lazy initialization.

### Example Usage Scenarios

The Proxy Pattern can be applied in various scenarios:

- **Remote Proxy**: Use a proxy to represent an object located on a remote server. The proxy handles communication with the server, providing a local interface for the client.
- **Virtual Proxy**: Use a proxy to delay the creation of a resource until it is needed. This can be useful for resources that are expensive to create or consume significant memory.
- **Protection Proxy**: Use a proxy to control access to an object based on user permissions. The proxy checks access rights before forwarding requests to the real object.

### Exercises

1. Implement a protection proxy that controls access to a sensitive resource based on user roles.
2. Modify the virtual proxy example to include logging functionality, recording each access to the real subject.
3. Create a remote proxy that simulates communication with a remote server.

### Visual Aids

Here is a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between the client, proxy, and real subject:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy
    participant RealSubject

    Client->>Proxy: request()
    alt RealSubject is not initialized
        Proxy->>Proxy: Initialize RealSubject
    end
    Proxy->>RealSubject: request()
    RealSubject-->>Proxy: Response
    Proxy-->>Client: Response
```
