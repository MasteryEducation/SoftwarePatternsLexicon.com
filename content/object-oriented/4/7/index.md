## 4.7. Flyweight Pattern

The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that focuses on minimizing memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share common data. Let's delve into the intricacies of this pattern, its implementation, and its practical applications.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Flyweight Pattern is to use sharing to support a large number of fine-grained objects efficiently. By sharing common parts of the state between multiple objects, the Flyweight Pattern reduces the memory footprint and enhances performance.

#### Key Motivations:

- **Memory Efficiency**: By sharing common data among objects, the Flyweight Pattern significantly reduces the memory usage.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing the number of objects in memory can lead to faster execution times, especially in systems with limited resources.
- **Scalability**: Helps in scaling applications by managing resources more efficiently.

### Applicability

The Flyweight Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- A large number of objects are required, and they share some common state.
- The cost of creating and maintaining these objects is high in terms of memory and performance.
- The objects can be divided into intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (unique) states.

### Structure

The Flyweight Pattern involves several key components:

- **Flyweight**: The interface through which flyweights can act on the extrinsic state.
- **Concrete Flyweight**: Implements the Flyweight interface and adds storage for intrinsic state.
- **Flyweight Factory**: Manages and creates flyweight objects, ensuring that shared instances are used.
- **Client**: Maintains references to flyweight objects and computes or stores the extrinsic state.

#### UML Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Flyweight {
        +operation(extrinsicState)
    }
    class ConcreteFlyweight {
        -intrinsicState
        +operation(extrinsicState)
    }
    class FlyweightFactory {
        -flyweights
        +getFlyweight(key)
    }
    class Client {
        -flyweight
        +operation()
    }
    Flyweight <|-- ConcreteFlyweight
    FlyweightFactory --> Flyweight
    Client --> Flyweight
```

### Participants and Collaborations

- **Flyweight**: Declares an interface through which flyweights can receive and act on extrinsic state.
- **Concrete Flyweight**: Implements the Flyweight interface and stores intrinsic state. Concrete Flyweights are shared and immutable.
- **Flyweight Factory**: Creates and manages flyweight objects. Ensures that flyweights are shared properly.
- **Client**: Maintains references to flyweights and computes or stores extrinsic state.

### Consequences

#### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State

- **Intrinsic State**: Shared among objects and stored in the flyweight. It is independent of the flyweight's context.
- **Extrinsic State**: Context-dependent and varies with each flyweight instance. It is stored or computed by the client.

#### Benefits

- **Reduced Memory Usage**: By sharing intrinsic state, the Flyweight Pattern reduces the number of objects in memory.
- **Improved Performance**: Fewer objects mean less memory overhead and potentially faster execution.

#### Trade-offs

- **Complexity**: Managing the extrinsic state can add complexity to the client code.
- **Increased Responsibility**: Clients must manage the extrinsic state, which can lead to more complex interactions.

### Implementation Considerations

#### Managing Shared Objects

- **Flyweight Factory**: Use a factory to manage the creation and sharing of flyweight objects. The factory ensures that shared instances are reused.
- **Immutable Intrinsic State**: Ensure that the intrinsic state is immutable to avoid unintended side effects from shared data.

### Detailed Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a detailed pseudocode implementation of the Flyweight Pattern.

```pseudocode
// Flyweight Interface
interface Flyweight {
    method operation(extrinsicState)
}

// Concrete Flyweight
class ConcreteFlyweight implements Flyweight {
    private intrinsicState

    constructor(intrinsicState) {
        this.intrinsicState = intrinsicState
    }

    method operation(extrinsicState) {
        // Use intrinsicState and extrinsicState
        print("Intrinsic State: " + this.intrinsicState + ", Extrinsic State: " + extrinsicState)
    }
}

// Flyweight Factory
class FlyweightFactory {
    private flyweights = {}

    method getFlyweight(key) {
        if (key not in flyweights) {
            flyweights[key] = new ConcreteFlyweight(key)
        }
        return flyweights[key]
    }
}

// Client
class Client {
    private flyweightFactory

    constructor(flyweightFactory) {
        this.flyweightFactory = flyweightFactory
    }

    method operation(extrinsicState) {
        flyweight = flyweightFactory.getFlyweight("sharedState")
        flyweight.operation(extrinsicState)
    }
}

// Usage
flyweightFactory = new FlyweightFactory()
client = new Client(flyweightFactory)
client.operation("uniqueState1")
client.operation("uniqueState2")
```

### Example Usage Scenarios

The Flyweight Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- **Text Editors**: Representing characters as flyweights, where the intrinsic state is the character code and the extrinsic state is the position in the document.
- **Graphics Applications**: Managing large numbers of graphical objects, such as trees in a forest, where the intrinsic state is the type of tree, and the extrinsic state is the position.
- **Game Development**: Representing game objects like bullets or enemies, where the intrinsic state is the type, and the extrinsic state is the position and state in the game world.

### Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of the Flyweight Pattern, try the following exercises:

1. **Implement a Flyweight Pattern**: Create a simple text editor that uses the Flyweight Pattern to manage characters.
2. **Modify the Pseudocode**: Change the intrinsic state to include additional properties and observe how it affects memory usage.
3. **Experiment with Extrinsic State**: Add more complexity to the extrinsic state and see how it impacts the client code.

### Visual Aids

#### Visualizing the Flyweight Pattern

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant FlyweightFactory
    participant ConcreteFlyweight

    Client->>FlyweightFactory: Request Flyweight
    FlyweightFactory->>ConcreteFlyweight: Create or Retrieve Flyweight
    FlyweightFactory-->>Client: Return Flyweight
    Client->>ConcreteFlyweight: Execute Operation with Extrinsic State
```
