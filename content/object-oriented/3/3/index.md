## 3.3. Factory Method Pattern

In the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP), the Factory Method Pattern stands as a cornerstone for creating objects in a way that promotes flexibility and extensibility. This pattern is particularly useful when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create. Let's delve into the intricacies of the Factory Method Pattern, exploring its intent, structure, and practical implementation through pseudocode.

### Intent and Motivation

The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. The primary intent is to define an interface for object creation, while deferring the instantiation process to subclasses. This approach is beneficial in scenarios where a class needs to delegate the responsibility of object creation to its subclasses.

#### Key Motivations:

- **Decoupling Object Creation:** By using a factory method, we decouple the code that creates an object from the code that uses the object. This separation allows for more flexible and maintainable code.
- **Promoting Extensibility:** Subclasses can override the factory method to change the class of objects that will be created, allowing for easy extension of the codebase.
- **Encapsulating Instantiation Logic:** The pattern encapsulates the instantiation logic, making it easier to manage changes and variations in object creation.

### Applicability

The Factory Method Pattern is applicable in various scenarios, including:

- **Dynamic Object Creation:** When a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.
- **Complex Object Initialization:** When the initialization of an object is complex or requires multiple steps.
- **Extensible Frameworks:** In frameworks where the core framework defines the interface for creating objects, and the specific implementations are provided by the client code.

### Structure

The structure of the Factory Method Pattern involves several key components:

- **Product:** Defines the interface for objects the factory method creates.
- **ConcreteProduct:** Implements the Product interface.
- **Creator:** Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. It may also define a default implementation of the factory method.
- **ConcreteCreator:** Overrides the factory method to return an instance of ConcreteProduct.

Here is a UML diagram illustrating the structure of the Factory Method Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Creator {
        <<abstract>>
        +createProduct() Product
    }
    class ConcreteCreator {
        +createProduct() ConcreteProduct
    }
    class Product {
        <<interface>>
    }
    class ConcreteProduct {
    }

    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Product <|-- ConcreteProduct
    Creator --> Product
    ConcreteCreator --> ConcreteProduct
```

### Participants and Collaborations

- **Creator:** The class that contains the factory method. It may provide a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object.
- **ConcreteCreator:** A subclass of Creator that overrides the factory method to return an instance of a specific ConcreteProduct.
- **Product:** The interface or abstract class that defines the type of objects the factory method creates.
- **ConcreteProduct:** A class that implements the Product interface.

These participants collaborate to allow the client code to work with the Product interface, while the ConcreteCreator handles the instantiation of specific ConcreteProduct objects.

### Consequences

The Factory Method Pattern offers several advantages, including:

- **Flexibility:** By decoupling the instantiation process from the client code, the pattern allows for more flexible and maintainable code.
- **Extensibility:** New ConcreteProduct classes can be added without modifying the existing client code.
- **Encapsulation:** The pattern encapsulates the instantiation logic, making it easier to manage changes and variations in object creation.

However, there are also some trade-offs to consider:

- **Complexity:** The pattern can introduce additional complexity, as it requires the creation of multiple classes and interfaces.
- **Overhead:** The pattern may introduce overhead if used in scenarios where simple object creation would suffice.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing the Factory Method Pattern, consider the following:

- **Parameterized Factories:** The factory method can be parameterized to allow for more flexible object creation. For example, the method can take a parameter that specifies the type of object to create.
- **Handling Product Variations:** The pattern can be extended to handle variations in product creation. For example, the factory method can be overridden to create different variations of a product based on specific criteria.

### Detailed Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a detailed pseudocode implementation of the Factory Method Pattern. We'll use a simple example of a logistics application that needs to create different types of transport vehicles.

```pseudocode
// Define the Product interface
interface Transport {
    method deliver()
}

// Implement ConcreteProduct classes
class Truck implements Transport {
    method deliver() {
        print("Delivering by land in a truck.")
    }
}

class Ship implements Transport {
    method deliver() {
        print("Delivering by sea in a ship.")
    }
}

// Define the Creator class
abstract class Logistics {
    // Factory method
    abstract method createTransport() : Transport

    method planDelivery() {
        // Call the factory method to create a Transport object
        transport = createTransport()
        // Use the Transport object
        transport.deliver()
    }
}

// Implement ConcreteCreator classes
class RoadLogistics extends Logistics {
    method createTransport() : Transport {
        return new Truck()
    }
}

class SeaLogistics extends Logistics {
    method createTransport() : Transport {
        return new Ship()
    }
}

// Client code
method main() {
    logistics = new RoadLogistics()
    logistics.planDelivery()

    logistics = new SeaLogistics()
    logistics.planDelivery()
}
```

In this pseudocode example, we define a `Transport` interface with a `deliver` method. The `Truck` and `Ship` classes implement this interface. The `Logistics` class is the Creator, which declares the factory method `createTransport`. The `RoadLogistics` and `SeaLogistics` classes are ConcreteCreators that override the factory method to create specific types of transport.

### Example Usage Scenarios

The Factory Method Pattern is widely used in various applications, including:

- **GUI Libraries:** To create different types of UI components based on the platform or theme.
- **Document Editors:** To create different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF) based on user input.
- **Game Development:** To create different types of game objects (e.g., enemies, power-ups) based on the game level.

### Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of the Factory Method Pattern, try the following exercises:

1. **Extend the Logistics Example:** Add a new type of transport, such as `Airplane`, and implement a new `AirLogistics` class.
2. **Parameterized Factory Method:** Modify the factory method to accept a parameter that specifies the type of transport to create.
3. **Real-World Application:** Identify a real-world application where the Factory Method Pattern could be applied, and outline how you would implement it.

### Visual Aids

To further illustrate the Factory Method Pattern, consider the following sequence diagram, which shows the interaction between the client code and the factory method:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Logistics
    participant Transport
    participant ConcreteTransport

    Client->>Logistics: planDelivery()
    Logistics->>Logistics: createTransport()
    Logistics->>ConcreteTransport: new()
    ConcreteTransport-->>Logistics: Transport
    Logistics->>Transport: deliver()
    Transport-->>Client: Delivery complete
```
