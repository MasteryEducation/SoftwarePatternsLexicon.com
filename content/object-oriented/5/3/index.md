## 5.3. Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is a fundamental behavioral design pattern in object-oriented programming that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing undo/redo operations, logging changes, and supporting transactional behavior in applications.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Command Pattern is to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. This pattern decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.

#### Key Motivations:

1. **Decoupling Sender and Receiver**: By encapsulating requests, the Command Pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receiver, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.
2. **Supporting Undo/Redo Operations**: The pattern allows for easy implementation of undoable operations by storing the state of commands.
3. **Command Queuing and Logging**: Commands can be queued, logged, or executed at a later time, providing flexibility in how requests are handled.

### Applicability

The Command Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You need to parameterize objects with operations.
- You want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
- You need to support undoable operations.
- You want to log changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash.

### Structure

The Command Pattern involves several key components:

- **Command Interface**: Declares an interface for executing an operation.
- **Concrete Command**: Implements the Command interface and defines the binding between a Receiver object and an action.
- **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.
- **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request.
- **Client**: Creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        +execute()
    }
    class ConcreteCommand {
        -Receiver receiver
        +execute()
    }
    class Receiver {
        +action()
    }
    class Invoker {
        -Command command
        +setCommand(Command)
        +executeCommand()
    }
    class Client {
        +main()
    }
    Command <|-- ConcreteCommand
    ConcreteCommand --> Receiver
    Invoker --> Command
    Client --> Invoker
```

### Participants and Collaborations

- **Command**: Declares an interface for executing an operation.
- **ConcreteCommand**: Implements the Command interface, binding a Receiver to an action.
- **Receiver**: Contains the logic to perform the action.
- **Invoker**: Holds a command and can invoke its execution.
- **Client**: Configures the Invoker with a ConcreteCommand.

### Consequences

The Command Pattern offers several benefits:

- **Decoupling**: It decouples the classes that invoke the operation from the object that knows how to perform it.
- **Undo/Redo**: It makes it easy to add new commands, including undo and redo operations.
- **Command History**: Commands can be stored for later execution, allowing for complex command sequences to be managed.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing the Command Pattern, consider the following:

- **Command Histories**: Maintain a history of executed commands to support undo/redo functionality.
- **Command Parameters**: Commands may need parameters to execute properly; consider how these will be passed and stored.
- **Concurrency**: If commands are executed in a multi-threaded environment, ensure thread safety.

### Detailed Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a detailed pseudocode implementation of the Command Pattern. We'll create a simple text editor application that supports undo and redo operations.

```pseudocode
// Command Interface
interface Command {
    execute()
    undo()
}

// Concrete Command for adding text
class AddTextCommand implements Command {
    private TextEditor editor
    private String text

    constructor(editor, text) {
        this.editor = editor
        this.text = text
    }

    execute() {
        editor.addText(text)
    }

    undo() {
        editor.removeText(text)
    }
}

// Receiver
class TextEditor {
    private String content = ""

    addText(text) {
        content += text
    }

    removeText(text) {
        content = content.substring(0, content.length - text.length)
    }

    getContent() {
        return content
    }
}

// Invoker
class CommandInvoker {
    private Stack<Command> history = new Stack<Command>()

    executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute()
        history.push(command)
    }

    undo() {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = history.pop()
            command.undo()
        }
    }
}

// Client
class Client {
    main() {
        TextEditor editor = new TextEditor()
        CommandInvoker invoker = new CommandInvoker()

        Command addHello = new AddTextCommand(editor, "Hello")
        invoker.executeCommand(addHello)

        Command addWorld = new AddTextCommand(editor, " World")
        invoker.executeCommand(addWorld)

        print(editor.getContent()) // Output: Hello World

        invoker.undo()
        print(editor.getContent()) // Output: Hello

        invoker.undo()
        print(editor.getContent()) // Output: (empty)
    }
}
```

### Example Usage Scenarios

The Command Pattern is versatile and can be applied in various scenarios:

1. **Text Editors**: Implementing undo/redo functionality for text changes.
2. **GUI Buttons**: Associating actions with button clicks in a graphical user interface.
3. **Transaction Systems**: Logging and executing transactions in a banking system.
4. **Remote Procedure Calls**: Encapsulating requests to be sent over a network.

### Exercises

1. **Extend the Text Editor**: Modify the pseudocode to include a `Redo` operation. Implement a `redo()` method in `CommandInvoker` and adjust the `Command` interface as needed.
2. **Add New Commands**: Create a new command for deleting text from the editor. Implement the `DeleteTextCommand` class and integrate it with the existing system.
3. **Implement a Macro Recorder**: Extend the text editor to record a sequence of commands and replay them. Implement a `MacroCommand` class that stores a list of commands and executes them in sequence.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of the Command Pattern, let's visualize the sequence of operations using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    participant Command
    participant Receiver

    Client->>Invoker: setCommand(Command)
    Client->>Invoker: executeCommand()
    Invoker->>Command: execute()
    Command->>Receiver: action()
    Command-->>Invoker: return
    Invoker-->>Client: return
```
