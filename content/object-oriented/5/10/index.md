## 5.10. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful design pattern in object-oriented programming that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to enable a client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime. By using the Strategy Pattern, you can enhance the flexibility and maintainability of your code by decoupling the algorithm from the client that uses it.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. The motivation behind using the Strategy Pattern is to avoid hardcoding algorithms into the client and to provide a way to select an algorithm at runtime.

- **Defining a Family of Algorithms**: The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a set of algorithms that can be used interchangeably. Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own class, implementing a common interface.
- **Encapsulating Each Algorithm**: By encapsulating algorithms in separate classes, you can easily add new algorithms or modify existing ones without affecting the client code.
- **Making Algorithms Interchangeable**: The Strategy Pattern enables you to switch between different algorithms at runtime, providing flexibility in how a task is performed.

### Applicability

The Strategy Pattern is applicable in the following scenarios:

- **Multiple Algorithms**: When you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to choose one at runtime.
- **Avoiding Conditional Statements**: When you want to avoid using complex conditional statements to select an algorithm.
- **Encapsulation**: When you want to encapsulate related algorithms in a way that allows them to be easily interchangeable.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: When you want to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new algorithms to be added without modifying existing code.

### Structure

The Strategy Pattern consists of the following key components:

- **Strategy Interface**: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms. The context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a concrete strategy.
- **Concrete Strategies**: Implement the strategy interface to provide specific algorithms.
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a strategy object and uses it to perform the algorithm.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        - strategy: Strategy
        + setStrategy(Strategy strategy)
        + executeStrategy()
    }
    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        + execute()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        + execute()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        + execute()
    }
    Context --> Strategy
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
```

### Key Participants

- **Strategy**: The interface that defines the algorithm's skeleton.
- **ConcreteStrategy**: Classes that implement the strategy interface and provide specific algorithm implementations.
- **Context**: The class that maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to the strategy.

### Participants and Collaborations

- **Strategy Interface**: Provides a common interface for all concrete strategies.
- **Concrete Strategies**: Implement the strategy interface and provide specific algorithm implementations.
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to the strategy.

### Consequences

The Strategy Pattern offers several advantages:

- **Enhancing Flexibility**: By encapsulating algorithms in separate classes, you can easily switch between different algorithms at runtime.
- **Simplifying Code**: The Strategy Pattern helps simplify code by removing complex conditional statements used to select an algorithm.
- **Adhering to the Open/Closed Principle**: The Strategy Pattern allows you to add new algorithms without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing the Strategy Pattern, consider the following:

- **Strategy Selection**: Provide a mechanism for selecting the appropriate strategy at runtime. This can be done through configuration files, user input, or other means.
- **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of switching strategies at runtime. Ensure that the strategy selection process does not introduce significant overhead.
- **State Management**: If strategies require state, ensure that the state is managed appropriately to avoid unintended side effects.

### Detailed Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a detailed pseudocode implementation of the Strategy Pattern. In this example, we'll create a simple calculator that can perform different operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using the Strategy Pattern.

```pseudocode
// Strategy Interface
interface OperationStrategy {
    execute(a, b)
}

// Concrete Strategy for Addition
class AdditionStrategy implements OperationStrategy {
    execute(a, b) {
        return a + b
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy for Subtraction
class SubtractionStrategy implements OperationStrategy {
    execute(a, b) {
        return a - b
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy for Multiplication
class MultiplicationStrategy implements OperationStrategy {
    execute(a, b) {
        return a * b
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy for Division
class DivisionStrategy implements OperationStrategy {
    execute(a, b) {
        if b == 0 then
            throw "Division by zero error"
        end if
        return a / b
    }
}

// Context
class Calculator {
    private strategy: OperationStrategy

    setStrategy(strategy: OperationStrategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy
    }

    executeStrategy(a, b) {
        return this.strategy.execute(a, b)
    }
}

// Client Code
calculator = new Calculator()

// Set strategy to addition and execute
calculator.setStrategy(new AdditionStrategy())
print("Addition: " + calculator.executeStrategy(5, 3))

// Set strategy to subtraction and execute
calculator.setStrategy(new SubtractionStrategy())
print("Subtraction: " + calculator.executeStrategy(5, 3))

// Set strategy to multiplication and execute
calculator.setStrategy(new MultiplicationStrategy())
print("Multiplication: " + calculator.executeStrategy(5, 3))

// Set strategy to division and execute
calculator.setStrategy(new DivisionStrategy())
print("Division: " + calculator.executeStrategy(5, 3))
```

### Example Usage Scenarios

The Strategy Pattern can be used in various scenarios, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement different sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort) as strategies and allow the client to choose the desired sorting algorithm at runtime.
- **Payment Processing**: Implement different payment processing methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) as strategies and allow the client to choose the desired payment method.
- **Data Compression**: Implement different data compression algorithms (e.g., gzip, bzip2, LZMA) as strategies and allow the client to choose the desired compression algorithm.

### Exercises

1. **Implement a Strategy Pattern for Sorting**: Create a sorting application using the Strategy Pattern. Implement different sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort) as strategies and allow the user to choose the desired sorting algorithm at runtime.

2. **Extend the Calculator Example**: Add more operations (e.g., modulus, exponentiation) to the calculator example using the Strategy Pattern. Implement these operations as new strategies and test them with the calculator.

3. **Create a Payment Processing System**: Implement a payment processing system using the Strategy Pattern. Implement different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) as strategies and allow the user to choose the desired payment method.

### Visual Aids

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between the context and strategy in the Strategy Pattern.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Context
    participant Strategy
    participant ConcreteStrategyA
    participant ConcreteStrategyB

    Client->>Context: setStrategy(ConcreteStrategyA)
    Client->>Context: executeStrategy()
    Context->>ConcreteStrategyA: execute()
    ConcreteStrategyA-->>Context: result
    Context-->>Client: result

    Client->>Context: setStrategy(ConcreteStrategyB)
    Client->>Context: executeStrategy()
    Context->>ConcreteStrategyB: execute()
    ConcreteStrategyB-->>Context: result
    Context-->>Client: result
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use the Strategy Pattern when you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to choose one at runtime, or when you want to avoid using complex conditional statements to select an algorithm.
- **Pitfalls**: Be cautious of the potential overhead introduced by switching strategies at runtime. Ensure that the strategy selection process does not introduce significant performance issues.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Strategy vs. State Pattern**: The Strategy Pattern is similar to the State Pattern in that both involve changing behavior at runtime. However, the Strategy Pattern focuses on selecting an algorithm, while the State Pattern focuses on changing the object's state.
- **Strategy vs. Template Method Pattern**: The Strategy Pattern is similar to the Template Method Pattern in that both involve defining a family of algorithms. However, the Strategy Pattern encapsulates each algorithm in a separate class, while the Template Method Pattern uses inheritance to define the algorithm's skeleton.

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding of the Strategy Pattern, try modifying the provided pseudocode examples. For instance, you can add a new operation to the calculator or implement a new sorting algorithm in the sorting application. Experiment with different strategies and observe how the Strategy Pattern enhances flexibility and maintainability.

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive applications using the Strategy Pattern. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
