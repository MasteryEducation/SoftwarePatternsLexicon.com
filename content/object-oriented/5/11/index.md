## 5.11. Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a classic behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure, promoting code reuse and consistency across different implementations.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Template Method Pattern is to define the structure of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps. This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple classes that share a similar process but differ in some specific steps. By using the Template Method Pattern, you can ensure that the overall structure of the algorithm remains consistent, while still allowing for flexibility in the implementation of individual steps.

#### Key Motivations:
- **Code Reuse**: By encapsulating the invariant parts of an algorithm in a base class, you can avoid code duplication and promote reuse.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the algorithm's structure is consistent across different implementations, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Flexibility**: Allows subclasses to customize specific steps of the algorithm without affecting the overall structure.

### Applicability

The Template Method Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:
- You have multiple classes that implement variations of the same algorithm.
- You want to enforce a consistent algorithm structure across different implementations.
- You need to allow subclasses to customize specific steps of an algorithm.

### Structure

The Template Method Pattern consists of the following components:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractClass {
        +templateMethod()
        ~primitiveOperation1()
        ~primitiveOperation2()
    }
    class ConcreteClass {
        +primitiveOperation1()
        +primitiveOperation2()
    }
    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClass
```

- **AbstractClass**: Defines the template method, which contains the skeleton of the algorithm. It also declares abstract primitive operations that must be implemented by subclasses.
- **ConcreteClass**: Implements the primitive operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm.

### Participants and Collaborations

- **AbstractClass**: 
  - Defines the template method, which outlines the algorithm's structure.
  - Declares abstract methods for each step of the algorithm that must be implemented by subclasses.

- **ConcreteClass**:
  - Implements the abstract methods defined in the AbstractClass.
  - Provides specific behavior for each step of the algorithm.

### Consequences

The Template Method Pattern offers several benefits:
- **Promotes Code Reuse**: By encapsulating the invariant parts of an algorithm in a base class, you can avoid code duplication and promote reuse.
- **Ensures Consistency**: The algorithm's structure is consistent across different implementations, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Provides Flexibility**: Subclasses can customize specific steps of the algorithm without affecting the overall structure.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks:
- **Increased Complexity**: The pattern can introduce additional complexity, as it requires the creation of an abstract class and multiple subclasses.
- **Limited Flexibility**: The pattern enforces a specific algorithm structure, which may not be suitable for all scenarios.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing the Template Method Pattern, consider the following:

- **Hook Methods**: These are optional methods in the base class that can be overridden by subclasses to provide additional behavior. Hook methods allow subclasses to "hook into" the algorithm at specific points without having to override the entire template method.

- **Abstract Methods**: These are the steps of the algorithm that must be implemented by subclasses. They define the specific behavior for each step of the algorithm.

- **Concrete Methods**: These are the steps of the algorithm that are implemented in the base class and are not intended to be overridden by subclasses.

### Detailed Pseudocode Implementation

Let's explore a detailed pseudocode implementation of the Template Method Pattern. We'll use a simple example of a data processing pipeline, where the steps of the pipeline are defined in a base class, and subclasses provide specific implementations for each step.

```pseudocode
// Abstract class defining the template method
class DataProcessor {
    // Template method defining the skeleton of the algorithm
    method processData() {
        readData()
        processData()
        saveData()
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    abstract method readData()
    abstract method processData()
    abstract method saveData()
}

// Concrete class implementing the abstract methods
class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    method readData() {
        // Read data from a CSV file
        print("Reading data from CSV file")
    }

    method processData() {
        // Process the CSV data
        print("Processing CSV data")
    }

    method saveData() {
        // Save the processed data to a file
        print("Saving processed data to file")
    }
}

// Concrete class implementing the abstract methods
class JSONDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    method readData() {
        // Read data from a JSON file
        print("Reading data from JSON file")
    }

    method processData() {
        // Process the JSON data
        print("Processing JSON data")
    }

    method saveData() {
        // Save the processed data to a database
        print("Saving processed data to database")
    }
}

// Client code
function main() {
    // Create a CSV data processor and process data
    csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor()
    csvProcessor.processData()

    // Create a JSON data processor and process data
    jsonProcessor = new JSONDataProcessor()
    jsonProcessor.processData()
}

main()
```

### Example Usage Scenarios

The Template Method Pattern is widely used in various scenarios, including:

- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Frameworks often use the Template Method Pattern to define the structure of operations, allowing developers to customize specific steps.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: As demonstrated in the pseudocode example, the pattern is useful for defining data processing pipelines where the steps are consistent, but the implementation varies.
- **Game Development**: In game development, the pattern can be used to define the structure of game loops, allowing different games to implement specific behaviors.

### Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of the Template Method Pattern, try the following exercises:

1. **Implement a Template Method Pattern for a Report Generator**: Create an abstract class `ReportGenerator` with a template method `generateReport()`. Implement concrete classes for different types of reports, such as `PDFReportGenerator` and `HTMLReportGenerator`.

2. **Extend the Data Processing Example**: Add a new subclass `XMLDataProcessor` to the data processing example, implementing the abstract methods to read, process, and save XML data.

3. **Create a Template Method Pattern for a Sorting Algorithm**: Define an abstract class `Sorter` with a template method `sort()`. Implement concrete classes for different sorting algorithms, such as `BubbleSorter` and `QuickSorter`.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the Template Method Pattern, let's visualize the flow of the algorithm using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AbstractClass
    participant ConcreteClass

    Client->>AbstractClass: processData()
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClass: readData()
    ConcreteClass-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClass: processData()
    ConcreteClass-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClass: saveData()
    ConcreteClass-->>AbstractClass: return
```

### Try It Yourself

Encourage experimentation by suggesting modifications to the code examples. For instance, try adding a new step to the data processing pipeline, such as `validateData()`, and implement it in the subclasses.
