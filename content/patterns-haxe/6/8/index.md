## 6.8 Iterator Pattern

The Iterator Pattern is a fundamental behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures, as it abstracts the traversal process and allows for flexible iteration mechanisms.

### Intent of the Iterator Pattern

The primary intent of the Iterator Pattern is to decouple the traversal logic from the actual data structure, enabling the client to iterate over the elements without needing to understand the intricacies of the data structure itself. This promotes cleaner, more maintainable code and enhances the flexibility of the application.

### Key Participants

1. **Iterator Interface**: Defines the methods for accessing and traversing elements.
2. **Concrete Iterator**: Implements the Iterator interface and maintains the current position in the traversal.
3. **Aggregate Interface**: Provides a method to create an iterator.
4. **Concrete Aggregate**: Implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the Concrete Iterator.

### Applicability

- Use the Iterator Pattern when you need to access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its internal structure.
- When multiple traversal algorithms are needed over a data structure.
- When you want to provide a uniform interface for traversing different aggregate structures.

### Implementing Iterator in Haxe

Let's delve into how we can implement the Iterator Pattern in Haxe, leveraging its unique features such as static typing and cross-platform capabilities.

#### Iterator Interface

In Haxe, we define an `Iterator` interface with two essential methods: `hasNext()` and `next()`. These methods will allow us to traverse the elements of a collection.

```haxe
interface Iterator<T> {
    public function hasNext(): Bool;
    public function next(): T;
}
```

#### Aggregate Interface

The Aggregate interface provides a method to create an iterator. This interface will be implemented by any collection that wants to provide an iterator.

```haxe
interface Aggregate<T> {
    public function createIterator(): Iterator<T>;
}
```

#### Concrete Iterator

The Concrete Iterator implements the Iterator interface and maintains the current position of the traversal. Let's consider a simple list as our aggregate structure.

```haxe
class ListIterator<T> implements Iterator<T> {
    private var list: Array<T>;
    private var position: Int = 0;

    public function new(list: Array<T>) {
        this.list = list;
    }

    public function hasNext(): Bool {
        return position < list.length;
    }

    public function next(): T {
        if (!hasNext()) throw "No more elements";
        return list[position++];
    }
}
```

#### Concrete Aggregate

The Concrete Aggregate implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the Concrete Iterator.

```haxe
class NumberList implements Aggregate<Int> {
    private var numbers: Array<Int>;

    public function new(numbers: Array<Int>) {
        this.numbers = numbers;
    }

    public function createIterator(): Iterator<Int> {
        return new ListIterator<Int>(numbers);
    }
}
```

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Custom Collections

The Iterator Pattern is particularly useful for custom collections where you want to provide a consistent way to traverse elements without exposing the internal structure.

```haxe
class CustomCollection<T> implements Aggregate<T> {
    private var items: Array<T>;

    public function new() {
        items = new Array<T>();
    }

    public function addItem(item: T): Void {
        items.push(item);
    }

    public function createIterator(): Iterator<T> {
        return new ListIterator<T>(items);
    }
}
```

#### Tree Structures

Navigating hierarchical data such as trees can be complex. The Iterator Pattern simplifies this by abstracting the traversal logic.

```haxe
class TreeNode<T> {
    public var value: T;
    public var children: Array<TreeNode<T>>;

    public function new(value: T) {
        this.value = value;
        this.children = new Array<TreeNode<T>>();
    }

    public function addChild(node: TreeNode<T>): Void {
        children.push(node);
    }
}

class TreeIterator<T> implements Iterator<T> {
    private var stack: Array<TreeNode<T>>;

    public function new(root: TreeNode<T>) {
        stack = [root];
    }

    public function hasNext(): Bool {
        return stack.length > 0;
    }

    public function next(): T {
        if (!hasNext()) throw "No more elements";
        var node = stack.pop();
        for (child in node.children) {
            stack.push(child);
        }
        return node.value;
    }
}
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: The Iterator Pattern is ideal when you need to provide multiple traversal methods over a collection or when the collection's structure is complex.
- **Haxe-Specific Features**: Haxe's static typing and cross-platform capabilities make it an excellent choice for implementing the Iterator Pattern, ensuring type safety and consistent behavior across different platforms.
- **Pitfalls**: Be cautious of modifying the collection while iterating, as this can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Differences and Similarities

The Iterator Pattern is often compared to the **Composite Pattern**, as both deal with collections of objects. However, while the Composite Pattern focuses on treating individual objects and compositions uniformly, the Iterator Pattern is concerned with traversing elements in a collection.

### Visualizing the Iterator Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Iterator Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the components using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Aggregate
    participant Iterator
    Client->>Aggregate: createIterator()
    Aggregate->>Iterator: new Iterator()
    Client->>Iterator: hasNext()
    Iterator-->>Client: Bool
    Client->>Iterator: next()
    Iterator-->>Client: Element
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying the data structures or adding new methods to the iterator. For instance, try implementing a reverse iterator or a filter iterator that only returns elements meeting certain criteria.
