## 6.11 Memento Pattern

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to capture and externalize an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the state to be restored at a later time. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo functionality or save checkpoints in applications, such as games.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Memento Pattern is to:

- Capture an object's internal state.
- Externalize the state without breaking encapsulation.
- Allow the object to be restored to this state later.

### Key Participants

1. **Memento**: Stores the internal state of the Originator. It is a snapshot of the Originator's state.
2. **Originator**: Creates a Memento containing a snapshot of its current state and uses the Memento to restore its state.
3. **Caretaker**: Manages the Memento. It is responsible for keeping track of the Memento but does not modify or inspect its contents.

### Applicability

Use the Memento Pattern when:

- You need to provide undo functionality.
- You want to save and restore an object's state at different points in time.
- You need to maintain encapsulation boundaries.

### Implementing Memento in Haxe

Let's explore how to implement the Memento Pattern in Haxe with a practical example. We'll create a simple text editor that supports undo functionality.

#### Memento Class

The Memento class stores the state of the Originator. In our example, it will store the text content of the editor.

```haxe
class Memento {
    private var state:String;

    public function new(state:String) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public function getState():String {
        return state;
    }
}
```

#### Originator

The Originator is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It creates a Memento to capture its state and uses it to restore its state.

```haxe
class TextEditor {
    private var content:String;

    public function new() {
        content = "";
    }

    public function write(text:String):Void {
        content += text;
    }

    public function save():Memento {
        return new Memento(content);
    }

    public function restore(memento:Memento):Void {
        content = memento.getState();
    }

    public function getContent():String {
        return content;
    }
}
```

#### Caretaker

The Caretaker is responsible for managing the Mementos. It keeps track of the Mementos but does not modify or inspect their contents.

```haxe
class Caretaker {
    private var mementos:Array<Memento>;

    public function new() {
        mementos = [];
    }

    public function addMemento(memento:Memento):Void {
        mementos.push(memento);
    }

    public function getMemento(index:Int):Memento {
        return mementos[index];
    }
}
```

#### Using the Memento Pattern

Let's see how we can use the Memento Pattern to implement undo functionality in our text editor.

```haxe
class Main {
    static function main() {
        var editor = new TextEditor();
        var caretaker = new Caretaker();

        editor.write("Hello, ");
        caretaker.addMemento(editor.save());

        editor.write("world!");
        caretaker.addMemento(editor.save());

        trace("Current Content: " + editor.getContent());

        // Undo last change
        editor.restore(caretaker.getMemento(0));
        trace("After Undo: " + editor.getContent());
    }
}
```

### Diagrams

To better understand the Memento Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the Originator, Memento, and Caretaker using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Originator
    participant Memento
    participant Caretaker

    Originator->>Memento: Create Memento
    Caretaker->>Memento: Store Memento
    Originator->>Memento: Restore from Memento
```

### Design Considerations

- **Encapsulation**: The Memento Pattern preserves encapsulation boundaries by not exposing the internal state of the Originator to the Caretaker.
- **Memory Usage**: Be mindful of memory usage when storing multiple Mementos, especially if the state is large.
- **Immutable Mementos**: Consider making Mementos immutable to prevent accidental modification.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Command Pattern**: While both patterns can be used to implement undo functionality, the Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, whereas the Memento Pattern captures the state of an object.
- **Prototype Pattern**: The Prototype Pattern involves cloning objects, which can be used to achieve similar results as the Memento Pattern but with different intent and implementation.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### State Restoration

The Memento Pattern is ideal for implementing undo functionality in applications. By capturing the state of an object at various points, you can easily restore it to a previous state.

#### Checkpointing

In games or applications where you need to save progress or checkpoints, the Memento Pattern provides a way to capture the state and restore it later.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Memento Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- Add more complex state to the `TextEditor` class, such as formatting or cursor position.
- Implement a redo functionality by managing multiple Mementos.
- Create a history feature that allows navigating through multiple states.
