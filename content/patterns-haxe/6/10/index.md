## 6.10 Interpreter Pattern

The Interpreter Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that allows developers to define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter to process sentences in that language. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to interpret expressions or commands, such as in mathematical calculators or scripting languages embedded within applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Interpreter Pattern is to interpret sentences in a language by defining a representation for its grammar. This involves creating a set of classes that represent different parts of the grammar and an interpreter that evaluates these classes based on a given context.

### Key Participants

1. **AbstractExpression**: Declares an abstract `interpret` method that is implemented by all concrete expressions.
2. **TerminalExpression**: Implements an `interpret` operation associated with terminal symbols in the grammar.
3. **NonTerminalExpression**: Implements an `interpret` operation for non-terminal symbols in the grammar.
4. **Context**: Contains information that's global to the interpreter.
5. **Client**: Builds (or is given) an abstract syntax tree representing a particular sentence in the language defined by the grammar. The abstract syntax tree is assembled from instances of the NonTerminalExpression and TerminalExpression classes.

### Applicability

Use the Interpreter Pattern when:

- You have a simple grammar and need to interpret sentences in that language.
- You want to implement a language interpreter or a simple scripting language.
- You need to evaluate expressions, such as mathematical expressions or logical conditions.

### Implementing Interpreter in Haxe

Let's delve into how we can implement the Interpreter Pattern in Haxe. We'll start by defining abstract expression classes, followed by the interpreter implementation.

#### Abstract Expression Classes

In Haxe, we can represent grammar rules using abstract expression classes. These classes form the basis of our interpreter.

```haxe
// AbstractExpression.hx
interface AbstractExpression {
    public function interpret(context: Context): Float;
}
```

#### Terminal and Non-Terminal Expressions

Terminal expressions represent the basic elements of the grammar, while non-terminal expressions represent more complex rules.

```haxe
// TerminalExpression.hx
class NumberExpression implements AbstractExpression {
    private var number: Float;

    public function new(number: Float) {
        this.number = number;
    }

    public function interpret(context: Context): Float {
        return number;
    }
}

// NonTerminalExpression.hx
class AddExpression implements AbstractExpression {
    private var left: AbstractExpression;
    private var right: AbstractExpression;

    public function new(left: AbstractExpression, right: AbstractExpression) {
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }

    public function interpret(context: Context): Float {
        return left.interpret(context) + right.interpret(context);
    }
}
```

#### Context Class

The context class holds any global information required by the interpreter.

```haxe
// Context.hx
class Context {
    // Contextual information can be added here
}
```

#### Interpreter Implementation

The interpreter evaluates expressions based on the context. Here's how you can implement a simple interpreter for mathematical expressions.

```haxe
// Interpreter.hx
class Interpreter {
    public static function main() {
        var context = new Context();
        
        // (5 + 10) + 20
        var expression: AbstractExpression = new AddExpression(
            new AddExpression(new NumberExpression(5), new NumberExpression(10)),
            new NumberExpression(20)
        );

        var result = expression.interpret(context);
        trace("Result: " + result); // Output: Result: 35
    }
}
```

### Diagrams

To better understand the structure of the Interpreter Pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractExpression {
        <<interface>>
        +interpret(Context): Float
    }
    class TerminalExpression {
        +interpret(Context): Float
    }
    class NonTerminalExpression {
        +interpret(Context): Float
    }
    class Context {
        // Contextual information
    }
    class Client {
        +main(): Void
    }
    AbstractExpression <|-- TerminalExpression
    AbstractExpression <|-- NonTerminalExpression
    Client --> AbstractExpression
    Client --> Context
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Interpreter Pattern is versatile and can be applied in various scenarios. Let's explore some common use cases.

#### Expression Evaluation

One of the most common applications of the Interpreter Pattern is in evaluating expressions, such as mathematical calculators.

#### Scripting Languages

The Interpreter Pattern can be used to embed custom scripting languages within applications, allowing users to define and execute scripts.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Interpreter Pattern, consider the following:

- **Complexity**: The pattern can become complex if the grammar is complex. Consider alternative approaches if the grammar is too intricate.
- **Performance**: The pattern may not be suitable for performance-critical applications due to the overhead of interpreting expressions.
- **Haxe-Specific Features**: Leverage Haxe's static typing and macro system to optimize the interpreter's performance and maintainability.

### Differences and Similarities

The Interpreter Pattern is often confused with the Strategy Pattern. While both involve defining a set of operations, the Interpreter Pattern focuses on interpreting a language, whereas the Strategy Pattern is about selecting an algorithm at runtime.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the expressions or adding new operations to see how the interpreter handles them. For instance, implement a `SubtractExpression` class and integrate it into the interpreter.
