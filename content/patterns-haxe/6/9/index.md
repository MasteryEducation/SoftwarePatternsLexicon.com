## 6.9 Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that allows you to define new operations on an object structure without modifying the classes of the elements on which it operates. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a complex object structure and you want to perform various operations on it without cluttering the object classes with multiple methods.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Visitor Pattern is to separate an algorithm from the object structure it operates on. This separation allows you to add new operations without modifying the existing object structure, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

### Key Participants

1. **Visitor Interface**: Declares a visit operation for each type of concrete element in the object structure.
2. **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the operations defined in the Visitor interface.
3. **Element Interface**: Declares an `accept` method that takes a visitor as an argument.
4. **Concrete Element**: Implements the `accept` method to call the visitor's operation corresponding to its class.
5. **Object Structure**: A collection of elements that can be iterated over and visited by a visitor.

### Applicability

Use the Visitor Pattern when:
- You have a complex object structure and need to perform operations on its elements.
- You want to add new operations without modifying the existing classes.
- The object structure rarely changes, but you frequently need to add new operations.

### Implementing Visitor in Haxe

Let's explore how to implement the Visitor Pattern in Haxe with a practical example.

#### Visitor Interface

First, define the `Visitor` interface with a method for each type of element.

```haxe
interface Visitor {
    function visitElementA(element: ElementA): Void;
    function visitElementB(element: ElementB): Void;
}
```

#### Element Interface

Next, define the `Element` interface with an `accept` method.

```haxe
interface Element {
    function accept(visitor: Visitor): Void;
}
```

#### Concrete Elements

Implement the `Element` interface in concrete element classes.

```haxe
class ElementA implements Element {
    public function new() {}

    public function accept(visitor: Visitor): Void {
        visitor.visitElementA(this);
    }

    public function operationA(): String {
        return "ElementA operation";
    }
}

class ElementB implements Element {
    public function new() {}

    public function accept(visitor: Visitor): Void {
        visitor.visitElementB(this);
    }

    public function operationB(): String {
        return "ElementB operation";
    }
}
```

#### Concrete Visitor

Implement the `Visitor` interface in concrete visitor classes.

```haxe
class ConcreteVisitor implements Visitor {
    public function new() {}

    public function visitElementA(element: ElementA): Void {
        trace("Visiting " + element.operationA());
    }

    public function visitElementB(element: ElementB): Void {
        trace("Visiting " + element.operationB());
    }
}
```

#### Object Structure

Create a structure to hold elements and allow them to be visited.

```haxe
class ObjectStructure {
    private var elements: Array<Element>;

    public function new() {
        elements = new Array<Element>();
    }

    public function addElement(element: Element): Void {
        elements.push(element);
    }

    public function accept(visitor: Visitor): Void {
        for (element in elements) {
            element.accept(visitor);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using the Visitor Pattern

Now, let's see how to use the Visitor Pattern in a Haxe application.

```haxe
class Main {
    static public function main() {
        var structure = new ObjectStructure();
        structure.addElement(new ElementA());
        structure.addElement(new ElementB());

        var visitor = new ConcreteVisitor();
        structure.accept(visitor);
    }
}
```

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Syntax Trees

In compilers or interpreters, the Visitor Pattern is often used to traverse syntax trees and perform operations like code analysis, optimization, or transformation.

#### Document Processing

In document processing applications, the Visitor Pattern can be used to apply actions like rendering, exporting, or converting documents to different formats.

### Visualizing the Visitor Pattern

Below is a class diagram representing the Visitor Pattern structure.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Visitor {
        <<interface>>
        +visitElementA(ElementA)
        +visitElementB(ElementB)
    }

    class ConcreteVisitor {
        +visitElementA(ElementA)
        +visitElementB(ElementB)
    }

    class Element {
        <<interface>>
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    class ElementA {
        +accept(Visitor)
        +operationA()
    }

    class ElementB {
        +accept(Visitor)
        +operationB()
    }

    class ObjectStructure {
        +addElement(Element)
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    Visitor <|-- ConcreteVisitor
    Element <|-- ElementA
    Element <|-- ElementB
    ObjectStructure o-- Element
    ElementA --> Visitor
    ElementB --> Visitor
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: The Visitor Pattern is ideal when you need to perform multiple unrelated operations on a class hierarchy and you want to avoid polluting the classes with these operations.
- **Haxe-Specific Features**: Haxe's strong typing and interface support make implementing the Visitor Pattern straightforward. Use Haxe's type inference to simplify code and improve readability.
- **Pitfalls**: The Visitor Pattern can become cumbersome if the object structure frequently changes, as each change requires updating the visitor interface and all its implementations.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Similar Patterns**: The Visitor Pattern is often compared to the Strategy Pattern. While both patterns allow you to define operations separately from the objects they operate on, the Visitor Pattern is more suited for operations that need to be applied across a complex object structure.
- **Differences**: Unlike the Strategy Pattern, which is used to encapsulate algorithms, the Visitor Pattern is used to perform operations on elements of an object structure.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Visitor Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- Add a new element type and update the visitor interface and concrete visitor.
- Implement a new concrete visitor that performs a different operation on the elements.
- Create a more complex object structure and apply multiple visitors to it.
