## 6.5 Mediator Pattern

In the realm of software design, managing complex interactions between objects can become cumbersome and error-prone. The **Mediator Pattern** offers a solution by introducing a mediator object that centralizes communication, reducing dependencies and promoting loose coupling. This pattern is particularly beneficial in Haxe, where cross-platform capabilities demand efficient and maintainable code structures.

### Definition

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Instead of objects communicating directly with each other, they communicate through a mediator. This reduces the number of connections between objects, simplifying the system's architecture.

### Intent

- **Simplify Communication:** Reduce the complexity of communication between objects by introducing a mediator.
- **Promote Loose Coupling:** Decouple objects from each other, allowing them to interact through a central mediator.
- **Enhance Maintainability:** Make the system easier to maintain and extend by centralizing control logic.

### Key Participants

1. **Mediator Interface:** Defines the communication methods used by colleague objects.
2. **Concrete Mediator:** Implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleague objects.
3. **Colleague Objects:** Objects that communicate with each other through the mediator.

### Applicability

- **User Interface Components:** Managing interactions between UI elements, such as buttons and text fields.
- **Chat Applications:** A server acting as a mediator between client messages.
- **Complex Systems:** Systems with many interdependent components that require coordination.

### Implementing Mediator in Haxe

Let's explore how to implement the Mediator Pattern in Haxe, focusing on its unique features and cross-platform capabilities.

#### Mediator Interface

The mediator interface defines the methods for communication between colleague objects. In Haxe, we can use interfaces to define this contract.

```haxe
interface Mediator {
    function notify(sender:Colleague, event:String):Void;
}
```

#### Colleague Objects

Colleague objects are the components that interact with each other through the mediator. They hold a reference to the mediator and use it to communicate.

```haxe
class Colleague {
    private var mediator:Mediator;
    
    public function new(mediator:Mediator) {
        this.mediator = mediator;
    }
    
    public function send(event:String):Void {
        mediator.notify(this, event);
    }
    
    public function receive(event:String):Void {
        trace('Colleague received event: ' + event);
    }
}
```

#### Concrete Mediator

The concrete mediator implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleague objects.

```haxe
class ConcreteMediator implements Mediator {
    private var colleagues:Array<Colleague>;
    
    public function new() {
        colleagues = [];
    }
    
    public function addColleague(colleague:Colleague):Void {
        colleagues.push(colleague);
    }
    
    public function notify(sender:Colleague, event:String):Void {
        for (col in colleagues) {
            if (col != sender) {
                col.receive(event);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Use Cases and Examples

#### User Interface Components

In a user interface, different components such as buttons, text fields, and sliders often need to interact. The mediator pattern can manage these interactions, ensuring that changes in one component are communicated to others without direct dependencies.

#### Chat Applications

In a chat application, a server can act as a mediator between clients. When a client sends a message, the server (mediator) distributes it to other clients, managing the communication flow.

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use:** Use the mediator pattern when you have a complex system with many interdependent objects that need to communicate.
- **Haxe-Specific Features:** Leverage Haxe's static typing and interface capabilities to define clear contracts for communication.
- **Pitfalls:** Avoid overusing the mediator pattern, as it can lead to a single point of failure if the mediator becomes too complex.

### Differences and Similarities

The mediator pattern is often confused with the observer pattern. While both patterns deal with communication between objects, the mediator pattern centralizes communication through a mediator, whereas the observer pattern allows objects to subscribe to events and be notified of changes.

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

To better understand the mediator pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Mediator {
        <<interface>>
        +notify(sender: Colleague, event: String): Void
    }
    class ConcreteMediator {
        +addColleague(colleague: Colleague): Void
        +notify(sender: Colleague, event: String): Void
    }
    class Colleague {
        -mediator: Mediator
        +send(event: String): Void
        +receive(event: String): Void
    }
    Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
    Colleague --> Mediator
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the mediator pattern by modifying the code examples. Try adding new colleague objects or events to see how the mediator handles communication. Consider implementing a simple chat application using the mediator pattern to manage client-server interactions.
