### Adhering to Project Guidelines

Each open-source project has its own set of guidelines for contributions. These guidelines help maintain consistency and quality across the project. Here are some common guidelines to follow:

1. **Contribution Process:** Understand the process for submitting contributions, which may involve creating pull requests, submitting patches, or using specific tools.
2. **Coding Standards:** Follow the project's coding standards, which may include naming conventions, indentation, and code organization.
3. **Documentation:** Ensure your contributions are well-documented, including code comments and updates to project documentation.

### Real-World Examples of Haxe Open Source Contributions

Let's explore some real-world examples of Haxe open-source contributions to understand how they have impacted the community:

#### Example 1: HaxeFlixel

HaxeFlixel is a popular open-source game development framework for Haxe. Contributors have added new features, fixed bugs, and improved documentation, making it a robust tool for game developers.

```haxe
// Example of a simple HaxeFlixel game setup
import flixel.FlxGame;
import flixel.FlxState;
import flixel.FlxG;

class Main extends FlxGame {
    public function new() {
        super(640, 480, PlayState);
    }
}

class PlayState extends FlxState {
    override public function create():Void {
        FlxG.bgColor = 0xff000000; // Set background color to black
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: OpenFL

OpenFL is an open-source implementation of the Flash API for Haxe. Contributors have worked on improving cross-platform support, adding new features, and optimizing performance.

```haxe
// Example of a simple OpenFL application
import openfl.display.Sprite;
import openfl.Lib;

class Main extends Sprite {
    public function new() {
        super();
        var circle = new Sprite();
        circle.graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000);
        circle.graphics.drawCircle(50, 50, 50);
        circle.graphics.endFill();
        addChild(circle);
    }
}

class ApplicationMain {
    public static function main() {
        Lib.current.addChild(new Main());
    }
}
```
