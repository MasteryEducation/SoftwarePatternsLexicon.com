### Creational Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern
- **Category:** Creational
- **Intent:** Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

```haxe
class Singleton {
    private static var instance:Singleton;
    
    private function new() {
        // Private constructor
    }
    
    public static function getInstance():Singleton {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Singleton class
- **Applicability:** Use when exactly one instance of a class is needed.
- **Design Considerations:** Ensure thread safety in multi-threaded environments.

#### Factory Method Pattern
- **Category:** Creational
- **Intent:** Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

```haxe
interface Product {
    public function operation():String;
}

class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
    public function operation():String {
        return "Result of ConcreteProductA";
    }
}

class Creator {
    public function factoryMethod():Product {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Creator, ConcreteProduct
- **Applicability:** Use when a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- **Design Considerations:** Promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into your code.

---

### Structural Design Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern
- **Category:** Structural
- **Intent:** Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.

```haxe
interface Target {
    public function request():Void;
}

class Adaptee {
    public function specificRequest():Void {
        trace("Specific request");
    }
}

class Adapter implements Target {
    private var adaptee:Adaptee;
    
    public function new(adaptee:Adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }
    
    public function request():Void {
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Target, Adapter, Adaptee
- **Applicability:** Use when you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- **Design Considerations:** Can be implemented as a class or object adapter.

#### Composite Pattern
- **Category:** Structural
- **Intent:** Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

```haxe
interface Component {
    public function operation():Void;
}

class Leaf implements Component {
    public function operation():Void {
        trace("Leaf operation");
    }
}

class Composite implements Component {
    private var children:Array<Component> = [];
    
    public function operation():Void {
        for (child in children) {
            child.operation();
        }
    }
    
    public function add(component:Component):Void {
        children.push(component);
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Component, Leaf, Composite
- **Applicability:** Use to represent hierarchies of objects.
- **Design Considerations:** Simplifies client code by treating individual objects and compositions uniformly.

---

### Behavioral Design Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern
- **Category:** Behavioral
- **Intent:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

```haxe
interface Strategy {
    public function execute():Void;
}

class ConcreteStrategyA implements Strategy {
    public function execute():Void {
        trace("Strategy A");
    }
}

class Context {
    private var strategy:Strategy;
    
    public function new(strategy:Strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    
    public function executeStrategy():Void {
        strategy.execute();
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Strategy, ConcreteStrategy, Context
- **Applicability:** Use when you need to use different variants of an algorithm.
- **Design Considerations:** Strategy pattern is often used in conjunction with the Factory Method pattern.

#### Observer Pattern
- **Category:** Behavioral
- **Intent:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

```haxe
interface Observer {
    public function update():Void;
}

class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    public function update():Void {
        trace("Observer updated");
    }
}

class Subject {
    private var observers:Array<Observer> = [];
    
    public function attach(observer:Observer):Void {
        observers.push(observer);
    }
    
    public function notifyObservers():Void {
        for (observer in observers) {
            observer.update();
        }
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Subject, Observer
- **Applicability:** Use when an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other.
- **Design Considerations:** Can result in a large number of small update notifications.

### Functional Programming Patterns in Haxe

#### Pure Functions and Immutability
- **Category:** Functional
- **Intent:** Ensure functions have no side effects and always produce the same output for the same input.

```haxe
function add(a:Int, b:Int):Int {
    return a + b;
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Pure functions
- **Applicability:** Use to improve testability and predictability.
- **Design Considerations:** Emphasize immutability to avoid unintended side effects.

#### Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas
- **Category:** Functional
- **Intent:** Functions that take other functions as parameters or return them as results.

```haxe
function applyFunction(f:Int->Int, value:Int):Int {
    return f(value);
}

var double = function(x:Int):Int {
    return x * 2;
};

trace(applyFunction(double, 5)); // Outputs: 10
```

- **Key Participants:** Higher-order functions, Lambdas
- **Applicability:** Use to create flexible and reusable code.
- **Design Considerations:** Can lead to more concise and expressive code.

---

### Concurrency and Asynchronous Patterns

#### Asynchronous Programming with Promises and Futures
- **Category:** Concurrency
- **Intent:** Simplify asynchronous programming by using promises to handle future values.

```haxe
import haxe.concurrent.Future;

function asyncOperation():Future<Int> {
    return Future.withValue(42);
}

asyncOperation().handle(function(result:Int) {
    trace("Result: " + result);
});
```

- **Key Participants:** Promises, Futures
- **Applicability:** Use to manage asynchronous operations without blocking.
- **Design Considerations:** Helps avoid callback hell and makes code more readable.

#### Producer-Consumer Pattern
- **Category:** Concurrency
- **Intent:** Separate the work of producing data from the work of consuming it.

```haxe
class ProducerConsumer {
    private var queue:Array<Int> = [];
    
    public function produce(item:Int):Void {
        queue.push(item);
        trace("Produced: " + item);
    }
    
    public function consume():Void {
        if (queue.length > 0) {
            var item = queue.shift();
            trace("Consumed: " + item);
        }
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Producer, Consumer
- **Applicability:** Use when you need to decouple data production from consumption.
- **Design Considerations:** Ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources.

---

### Architectural Patterns with Haxe

#### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Category:** Architectural
- **Intent:** Separate an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.

```haxe
class Model {
    public var data:String;
}

class View {
    public function display(data:String):Void {
        trace("Displaying: " + data);
    }
}

class Controller {
    private var model:Model;
    private var view:View;
    
    public function new(model:Model, view:View) {
        this.model = model;
        this.view = view;
    }
    
    public function updateView():Void {
        view.display(model.data);
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Model, View, Controller
- **Applicability:** Use to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented.
- **Design Considerations:** Facilitates parallel development and improves code maintainability.

#### Microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture
- **Category:** Architectural
- **Intent:** Build applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.

```haxe
class UserService {
    public function getUser(id:Int):String {
        return "User " + id;
    }
}

class OrderService {
    public function getOrder(id:Int):String {
        return "Order " + id;
    }
}
```

- **Key Participants:** Services
- **Applicability:** Use to build scalable and flexible applications.
- **Design Considerations:** Requires careful management of service interactions and data consistency.
