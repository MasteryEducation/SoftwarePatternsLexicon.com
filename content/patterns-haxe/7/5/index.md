## 7.5 Functional Data Structures

Functional data structures are a cornerstone of functional programming, offering immutability and persistence, which are crucial for building reliable and concurrent applications. In this section, we will delve into the world of functional data structures in Haxe, exploring their implementation, benefits, and practical applications.

### Understanding Functional Data Structures

**Definition:** Functional data structures are immutable data structures that allow for efficient copying and updates. They are designed to be used in functional programming paradigms, where data immutability is a key principle.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Immutability:** Once created, a functional data structure cannot be modified. Instead, operations on the structure return a new version with the desired changes.
- **Persistence:** Functional data structures maintain previous versions of themselves, allowing for efficient access to historical states.
- **Efficiency:** Despite their immutability, these structures are designed to perform updates and accesses efficiently, often using techniques like structural sharing.

### Implementing Functional Data Structures in Haxe

Haxe, with its multi-paradigm support, is well-suited for implementing functional data structures. Let's explore some common types and how they can be implemented in Haxe.

#### Persistent Data Structures

Persistent data structures are a type of functional data structure that retains previous versions of itself. This is achieved through structural sharing, where new versions share parts of the old structure to minimize memory usage.

##### Immutable Lists

An immutable list is a classic example of a persistent data structure. In Haxe, we can implement an immutable list using a simple recursive data type.

```haxe
class ImmutableList<T> {
    private var head: T;
    private var tail: ImmutableList<T>;

    public function new(head: T, tail: ImmutableList<T> = null) {
        this.head = head;
        this.tail = tail;
    }

    public function prepend(value: T): ImmutableList<T> {
        return new ImmutableList(value, this);
    }

    public function getHead(): T {
        return head;
    }

    public function getTail(): ImmutableList<T> {
        return tail;
    }
}

// Usage
var list = new ImmutableList(1).prepend(2).prepend(3);
trace(list.getHead()); // Outputs: 3
```

In this example, each `prepend` operation creates a new list node, sharing the tail with the previous list, thus achieving immutability and persistence.

##### Immutable Trees

Trees are another common functional data structure. An immutable binary tree can be implemented similarly, using recursive data types.

```haxe
class ImmutableTree<T> {
    private var value: T;
    private var left: ImmutableTree<T>;
    private var right: ImmutableTree<T>;

    public function new(value: T, left: ImmutableTree<T> = null, right: ImmutableTree<T> = null) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }

    public function insert(newValue: T): ImmutableTree<T> {
        if (newValue < value) {
            return new ImmutableTree(value, left == null ? new ImmutableTree(newValue) : left.insert(newValue), right);
        } else {
            return new ImmutableTree(value, left, right == null ? new ImmutableTree(newValue) : right.insert(newValue));
        }
    }

    public function getValue(): T {
        return value;
    }

    public function getLeft(): ImmutableTree<T> {
        return left;
    }

    public function getRight(): ImmutableTree<T> {
        return right;
    }
}

// Usage
var tree = new ImmutableTree(5).insert(3).insert(7);
trace(tree.getValue()); // Outputs: 5
```

In this tree implementation, each `insert` operation returns a new tree, preserving the immutability of the original structure.

#### Functional Libraries in Haxe

Haxe offers several libraries that provide functional data structures, making it easier to leverage immutability and persistence in your applications.

- **Lambda:** A library that provides functional operations on collections, such as map, filter, and reduce.
- **Haxe DS:** A collection of data structures, including immutable versions of common collections.

### Benefits of Functional Data Structures

Functional data structures offer several advantages, particularly in the context of cross-platform development with Haxe.

#### Reliability

Immutability ensures that state changes are explicit and predictable. This reduces the likelihood of bugs caused by unintended side effects, leading to more reliable code.

#### Concurrency

In a multithreaded context, immutable data structures are inherently thread-safe, as they cannot be modified. This simplifies concurrent programming and reduces the need for complex synchronization mechanisms.

#### Efficiency

Despite their immutability, functional data structures are designed to be efficient. Structural sharing allows for quick updates and minimal memory usage, making them suitable for performance-critical applications.

### Visualizing Functional Data Structures

To better understand how functional data structures work, let's visualize the concept of structural sharing using a simple diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original List] --> B[New List with Added Element];
    B --> C[Shared Tail];
    A --> C;
```

**Diagram Explanation:** In this diagram, the original list shares its tail with the new list created by adding an element. This demonstrates how structural sharing minimizes memory usage while maintaining immutability.

### Practical Applications

Functional data structures are widely used in various domains, including:

- **Functional Programming:** As a fundamental concept, they are essential for writing pure functions and maintaining immutability.
- **Concurrent Systems:** Their thread-safe nature makes them ideal for concurrent and parallel programming.
- **Version Control Systems:** The ability to efficiently manage historical states is valuable for implementing features like undo/redo.
