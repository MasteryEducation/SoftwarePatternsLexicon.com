## 7.8 Pattern Matching in Functional Programming

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in functional programming that allows developers to check a value against a pattern. It simplifies complex conditional logic and data extraction, making code more readable and maintainable. In Haxe, pattern matching is implemented using the `switch` statement, which offers a robust mechanism for handling various data types and structures.

### Understanding Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is akin to a more powerful and flexible version of the traditional `switch` or `if-else` statements found in many programming languages. It allows you to match complex data structures, deconstruct them, and execute code based on the structure and content of the data.

#### Key Concepts

- **Patterns:** These are templates that describe the shape and content of data you want to match against.
- **Deconstruction:** This involves breaking down complex data structures into their constituent parts.
- **Guards:** These are additional conditions that must be satisfied for a pattern to match.

### Implementing Pattern Matching in Haxe

Haxe provides a robust `switch` statement that supports pattern matching. This feature allows you to match against various data types, including enums, classes, and basic types.

#### Pattern Matching with `switch`

The `switch` statement in Haxe is more powerful than in many other languages. It allows you to match on types, values, and even deconstruct data structures.

```haxe
class Main {
    static function main() {
        var value = 42;
        
        switch (value) {
            case 0:
                trace("Zero");
            case 1:
                trace("One");
            case 2...10:
                trace("Between two and ten");
            case _:
                trace("Something else");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `switch` statement matches the integer `value` against several patterns. The underscore `_` acts as a wildcard, matching any value not explicitly handled by other cases.

#### Deconstruction

Deconstruction is a powerful feature of pattern matching that allows you to extract values from complex data structures directly within a `switch` statement.

```haxe
enum Shape {
    Circle(radius: Float);
    Rectangle(width: Float, height: Float);
}

class Main {
    static function main() {
        var shape: Shape = Shape.Circle(5.0);
        
        switch (shape) {
            case Circle(radius):
                trace("Circle with radius: " + radius);
            case Rectangle(width, height):
                trace("Rectangle with width: " + width + " and height: " + height);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` enum is deconstructed within the `switch` statement, allowing direct access to the `radius`, `width`, and `height` values.

### Use Cases for Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to simplify complex conditional logic or extract data from structured data types.

#### Conditional Logic

Pattern matching can replace complex `if-else` chains, making your code cleaner and more intuitive.

```haxe
class Main {
    static function main() {
        var score = 85;
        
        switch (score) {
            case 90...100:
                trace("Excellent");
            case 75...89:
                trace("Good");
            case 50...74:
                trace("Average");
            case _:
                trace("Needs Improvement");
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how pattern matching can simplify the logic for grading scores.

#### Data Extraction

Pattern matching is ideal for extracting data from complex structures, such as nested objects or collections.

```haxe
typedef Person = {
    name: String,
    age: Int,
    address: { city: String, zip: String }
};

class Main {
    static function main() {
        var person: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30, address: { city: "Wonderland", zip: "12345" } };
        
        switch (person) {
            case { name, age, address: { city, zip } }:
                trace("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", City: " + city + ", Zip: " + zip);
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the `switch` statement deconstructs the `Person` typedef, allowing easy access to nested fields.

### Advanced Pattern Matching Techniques

Haxe's pattern matching capabilities extend beyond basic usage, offering advanced techniques for more complex scenarios.

#### Using Guards

Guards are additional conditions that can be used within a pattern to refine matches.

```haxe
class Main {
    static function main() {
        var number = 42;
        
        switch (number) {
            case n if n % 2 == 0:
                trace("Even number");
            case _:
                trace("Odd number");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a guard is used to check if a number is even before matching the pattern.

#### Matching Complex Data Structures

Pattern matching can handle complex data structures, such as nested enums or collections.

```haxe
enum Tree {
    Leaf(value: Int);
    Node(left: Tree, right: Tree);
}

class Main {
    static function main() {
        var tree: Tree = Node(Leaf(1), Node(Leaf(2), Leaf(3)));
        
        switch (tree) {
            case Leaf(value):
                trace("Leaf with value: " + value);
            case Node(left, right):
                trace("Node with left and right subtrees");
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates pattern matching on a recursive data structure, allowing you to traverse and process trees efficiently.

### Visualizing Pattern Matching

To better understand pattern matching, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Check Pattern}
    B -->|Match| C[Execute Code]
    B -->|No Match| D[Next Pattern]
    D --> E{More Patterns?}
    E -->|Yes| B
    E -->|No| F[Default Case]
    F --> G[End]
```

This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process in pattern matching, where each pattern is checked sequentially until a match is found or the default case is executed.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by modifying the patterns and data structures. Try adding new cases, using guards, or matching different data types to see how pattern matching can simplify your code.
