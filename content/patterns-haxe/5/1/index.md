## 5.1 Adapter Pattern

In the realm of software design, the Adapter Pattern stands out as a crucial structural pattern that enables classes with incompatible interfaces to work together seamlessly. This pattern is particularly valuable in cross-platform development environments like Haxe, where integrating diverse components is often necessary. Let's delve into the intricacies of the Adapter Pattern, explore its implementation in Haxe, and examine practical use cases.

### Intent of the Adapter Pattern

The primary intent of the Adapter Pattern is to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate without modifying their source code. This pattern is akin to a translator that enables communication between two parties speaking different languages.

### Key Participants

1. **Target Interface**: Defines the domain-specific interface that the client uses.
2. **Adaptee**: The existing interface that needs adapting.
3. **Adapter**: A class that bridges the gap between the Target and the Adaptee by implementing the Target interface and internally using an instance of the Adaptee.
4. **Client**: The class that interacts with the Target interface.

### Implementing Adapter in Haxe

Haxe, with its multi-paradigm support and cross-platform capabilities, provides a robust environment for implementing the Adapter Pattern. There are two primary ways to implement this pattern in Haxe: Class Adapter via Inheritance and Object Adapter via Composition.

#### Class Adapter via Inheritance

In this approach, the Adapter class inherits from the Adaptee and implements the Target interface. This method leverages inheritance to adapt the interface.

```haxe
// Target Interface
interface MediaPlayer {
    function play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void;
}

// Adaptee Class
class AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public function new() {}
    
    public function playVlc(fileName:String):Void {
        trace("Playing vlc file: " + fileName);
    }
    
    public function playMp4(fileName:String):Void {
        trace("Playing mp4 file: " + fileName);
    }
}

// Adapter Class
class MediaAdapter extends AdvancedMediaPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
    public function new() {
        super();
    }
    
    public function play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void {
        if (audioType == "vlc") {
            playVlc(fileName);
        } else if (audioType == "mp4") {
            playMp4(fileName);
        }
    }
}

// Client Class
class AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
    private var mediaAdapter:MediaAdapter;
    
    public function new() {
        mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter();
    }
    
    public function play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void {
        if (audioType == "mp3") {
            trace("Playing mp3 file: " + fileName);
        } else if (audioType == "vlc" || audioType == "mp4") {
            mediaAdapter.play(audioType, fileName);
        } else {
            trace("Invalid media. " + audioType + " format not supported");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
class Main {
    static public function main() {
        var audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
        audioPlayer.play("mp3", "song.mp3");
        audioPlayer.play("mp4", "video.mp4");
        audioPlayer.play("vlc", "movie.vlc");
        audioPlayer.play("avi", "clip.avi");
    }
}
```

In this example, `MediaAdapter` extends `AdvancedMediaPlayer` and implements the `MediaPlayer` interface, allowing it to adapt the `AdvancedMediaPlayer` methods to the `MediaPlayer` interface.

#### Object Adapter via Composition

This approach involves creating an Adapter class that contains an instance of the Adaptee. The Adapter implements the Target interface and delegates calls to the Adaptee.

```haxe
// Target Interface
interface MediaPlayer {
    function play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void;
}

// Adaptee Class
class AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public function new() {}
    
    public function playVlc(fileName:String):Void {
        trace("Playing vlc file: " + fileName);
    }
    
    public function playMp4(fileName:String):Void {
        trace("Playing mp4 file: " + fileName);
    }
}

// Adapter Class
class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    private var advancedMediaPlayer:AdvancedMediaPlayer;
    
    public function new() {
        advancedMediaPlayer = new AdvancedMediaPlayer();
    }
    
    public function play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void {
        if (audioType == "vlc") {
            advancedMediaPlayer.playVlc(fileName);
        } else if (audioType == "mp4") {
            advancedMediaPlayer.playMp4(fileName);
        }
    }
}

// Client Class
class AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
    private var mediaAdapter:MediaAdapter;
    
    public function new() {
        mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter();
    }
    
    public function play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void {
        if (audioType == "mp3") {
            trace("Playing mp3 file: " + fileName);
        } else if (audioType == "vlc" || audioType == "mp4") {
            mediaAdapter.play(audioType, fileName);
        } else {
            trace("Invalid media. " + audioType + " format not supported");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
class Main {
    static public function main() {
        var audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
        audioPlayer.play("mp3", "song.mp3");
        audioPlayer.play("mp4", "video.mp4");
        audioPlayer.play("vlc", "movie.vlc");
        audioPlayer.play("avi", "clip.avi");
    }
}
```

In this example, `MediaAdapter` uses composition to hold an instance of `AdvancedMediaPlayer` and adapts its methods to the `MediaPlayer` interface.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

To better understand the Adapter Pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class MediaPlayer {
        <<interface>>
        +play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void
    }
    
    class AdvancedMediaPlayer {
        +playVlc(fileName:String):Void
        +playMp4(fileName:String):Void
    }
    
    class MediaAdapter {
        +play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void
    }
    
    class AudioPlayer {
        +play(audioType:String, fileName:String):Void
    }
    
    MediaPlayer <|.. MediaAdapter
    MediaAdapter o-- AdvancedMediaPlayer
    MediaPlayer <|.. AudioPlayer
    AudioPlayer o-- MediaAdapter
```

**Diagram Description:** This class diagram illustrates the relationship between the `MediaPlayer` interface, `AdvancedMediaPlayer` class, `MediaAdapter` class, and `AudioPlayer` class. The `MediaAdapter` implements the `MediaPlayer` interface and uses an instance of `AdvancedMediaPlayer` to adapt its methods.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Adapter Pattern is widely used in software development to integrate legacy code and third-party libraries into modern applications. Here are some practical use cases:

#### Integrating Legacy Code

When working with legacy systems, you may encounter outdated components that need to be integrated into new applications. The Adapter Pattern allows you to wrap these components with a new interface, enabling seamless integration without altering the original code.

#### Third-Party Libraries

Third-party libraries often come with their own interfaces, which may not align with your application's architecture. By using the Adapter Pattern, you can create a wrapper that adapts the library's interface to match your application's requirements, facilitating smooth integration.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Adapter Pattern in Haxe, consider the following:

- **Class Adapter vs. Object Adapter**: Choose between inheritance and composition based on your specific needs. Use class adapters when you need to extend the Adaptee's behavior, and object adapters when you want to use composition for greater flexibility.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of using adapters, especially in performance-critical applications. Adapters can introduce additional layers of abstraction, which may impact performance.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure that your adapters are well-documented and maintainable. Adapters can become complex, especially when dealing with multiple interfaces and components.

### Differences and Similarities

The Adapter Pattern is often confused with the Facade Pattern. While both patterns involve wrapping interfaces, they serve different purposes:

- **Adapter Pattern**: Focuses on converting one interface into another to enable compatibility between classes.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Adapter Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided. Experiment with different audio types and implement additional methods in the `AdvancedMediaPlayer` class. Observe how the `MediaAdapter` adapts these methods to the `MediaPlayer` interface.
