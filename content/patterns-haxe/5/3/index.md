## 5.3 Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In this section, we will delve into the Composite Pattern, its implementation in Haxe, and explore practical use cases and examples.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Composite Pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is particularly useful when you want to represent part-whole hierarchies, such as UI component trees or file system structures.

### Key Participants

1. **Component Interface**: Defines the interface for all objects in the composition, both leaf and composite nodes.
2. **Leaf Nodes**: Implements the component interface and represents objects without children.
3. **Composite Nodes**: Implements the component interface, holds child components, and implements operations on child components.

### Applicability

Use the Composite Pattern when:
- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- You want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.
- You need to create a tree structure of objects and allow clients to interact with these objects uniformly.

### Implementing Composite in Haxe

Let's explore how to implement the Composite Pattern in Haxe by defining a component interface, leaf nodes, and composite nodes.

#### Component Interface

The component interface defines operations for both leaves and composites. In Haxe, we can define this interface using an abstract class or an interface.

```haxe
interface Graphic {
    public function draw():Void;
}
```

#### Leaf Nodes

Leaf nodes implement the component interface and represent objects without children. Here is an example of a leaf node in Haxe:

```haxe
class Circle implements Graphic {
    public function new() {}

    public function draw():Void {
        trace("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}
```

#### Composite Nodes

Composite nodes hold child components and implement operations on these children. Here's how you can define a composite node in Haxe:

```haxe
class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic {
    private var children:Array<Graphic>;

    public function new() {
        children = new Array<Graphic>();
    }

    public function add(graphic:Graphic):Void {
        children.push(graphic);
    }

    public function remove(graphic:Graphic):Void {
        children.remove(graphic);
    }

    public function draw():Void {
        for (child in children) {
            child.draw();
        }
    }
}
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Composite Pattern is widely used in scenarios where you need to represent part-whole hierarchies. Let's explore some common use cases and examples.

#### UI Component Trees

One of the most common use cases for the Composite Pattern is building user interfaces with nested components. In a UI component tree, each component can be a leaf or a composite, allowing for complex UI structures.

```haxe
class Button implements Graphic {
    public function new() {}

    public function draw():Void {
        trace("Drawing a Button");
    }
}

class Window {
    private var content:CompositeGraphic;

    public function new() {
        content = new CompositeGraphic();
    }

    public function addComponent(component:Graphic):Void {
        content.add(component);
    }

    public function draw():Void {
        content.draw();
    }
}

class Main {
    static function main() {
        var window = new Window();
        window.addComponent(new Circle());
        window.addComponent(new Button());
        window.draw();
    }
}
```

#### File System Structures

Another common use case is representing file system structures, where files are leaf nodes and directories are composite nodes.

```haxe
class File implements Graphic {
    private var name:String;

    public function new(name:String) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public function draw():Void {
        trace("File: " + name);
    }
}

class Directory implements Graphic {
    private var name:String;
    private var children:Array<Graphic>;

    public function new(name:String) {
        this.name = name;
        children = new Array<Graphic>();
    }

    public function add(graphic:Graphic):Void {
        children.push(graphic);
    }

    public function remove(graphic:Graphic):Void {
        children.remove(graphic);
    }

    public function draw():Void {
        trace("Directory: " + name);
        for (child in children) {
            child.draw();
        }
    }
}

class FileSystem {
    static function main() {
        var root = new Directory("root");
        var home = new Directory("home");
        var file1 = new File("file1.txt");
        var file2 = new File("file2.txt");

        root.add(home);
        home.add(file1);
        home.add(file2);

        root.draw();
    }
}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Composite Pattern, consider the following:

- **Uniformity**: Ensure that the component interface is consistent across leaf and composite nodes.
- **Efficiency**: Be mindful of the performance implications of traversing large composite structures.
- **Flexibility**: Design the component interface to accommodate future extensions or modifications.

### Differences and Similarities

The Composite Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both involve tree structures, the Composite Pattern focuses on part-whole hierarchies, whereas the Decorator Pattern focuses on adding behavior to individual objects.

### Visualizing Composite Pattern

To better understand the Composite Pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Graphic {
        <<interface>>
        +draw(): Void
    }
    class Circle {
        +draw(): Void
    }
    class CompositeGraphic {
        +add(Graphic): Void
        +remove(Graphic): Void
        +draw(): Void
    }
    Graphic <|-- Circle
    Graphic <|-- CompositeGraphic
    CompositeGraphic o-- Graphic
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the component interface, leaf nodes, and composite nodes.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Composite Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- Add more shapes, such as rectangles or triangles, to the UI component tree.
- Implement additional operations, such as resizing or moving components.
- Create a more complex file system structure with nested directories.
