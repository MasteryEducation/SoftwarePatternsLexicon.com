## 4.5 Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing one, rather than instantiating a new object from scratch. This approach can be particularly useful in scenarios where object creation is resource-intensive or when you need to maintain a dynamic object structure that can evolve at runtime.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Prototype Pattern is to:

- **Reduce the cost of creating objects** by cloning existing instances.
- **Allow dynamic object structures** that can be modified at runtime.
- **Simplify the creation of complex objects** by reusing existing instances as prototypes.

### Key Participants

1. **Prototype Interface**: Declares the `clone()` method for cloning objects.
2. **Concrete Prototype**: Implements the `clone()` method to create a copy of itself.
3. **Client**: Uses the `clone()` method to create new objects.

### Applicability

Use the Prototype Pattern when:

- Object creation is expensive or complex.
- You need to create objects dynamically at runtime.
- You want to avoid subclassing for object creation.
- You need to maintain a registry of objects that can be cloned.

### Implementing Prototype in Haxe

#### Cloning Methods

In Haxe, implementing the Prototype Pattern involves creating a `clone()` method that returns a copy of the object. This method can be implemented to perform either shallow or deep copies, depending on the requirements.

```haxe
interface Prototype<T> {
    public function clone():T;
}

class ConcretePrototype implements Prototype<ConcretePrototype> {
    public var data:Int;
    
    public function new(data:Int) {
        this.data = data;
    }
    
    public function clone():ConcretePrototype {
        // Create a new instance with the same data
        return new ConcretePrototype(this.data);
    }
}

// Usage
var original = new ConcretePrototype(42);
var copy = original.clone();
trace(copy.data); // Output: 42
```

In this example, the `ConcretePrototype` class implements the `Prototype` interface, providing a `clone()` method that creates a new instance with the same data.

#### Prototype Registries

A prototype registry can be used to store and manage prototypes for cloning. This approach allows you to maintain a collection of prototypes that can be cloned on demand.

```haxe
class PrototypeRegistry {
    private var prototypes:Map<String, Prototype<Dynamic>>;

    public function new() {
        prototypes = new Map<String, Prototype<Dynamic>>();
    }

    public function registerPrototype(key:String, prototype:Prototype<Dynamic>):Void {
        prototypes.set(key, prototype);
    }

    public function getPrototype(key:String):Prototype<Dynamic> {
        return prototypes.get(key);
    }
}

// Usage
var registry = new PrototypeRegistry();
var prototype = new ConcretePrototype(100);
registry.registerPrototype("example", prototype);

var clonedPrototype = registry.getPrototype("example").clone();
trace(clonedPrototype.data); // Output: 100
```

The `PrototypeRegistry` class manages a collection of prototypes, allowing you to register and retrieve prototypes by key.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Performance Optimization

The Prototype Pattern can significantly reduce the cost of object creation, especially when dealing with complex objects that require significant resources to instantiate.

```haxe
class ExpensiveObject implements Prototype<ExpensiveObject> {
    public var data:Array<Int>;

    public function new() {
        // Simulate expensive initialization
        data = [];
        for (i in 0...1000000) {
            data.push(i);
        }
    }

    public function clone():ExpensiveObject {
        // Perform a shallow copy of the data array
        var newObj = new ExpensiveObject();
        newObj.data = this.data.copy();
        return newObj;
    }
}

// Usage
var original = new ExpensiveObject();
var copy = original.clone();
trace(copy.data.length); // Output: 1000000
```

In this example, the `ExpensiveObject` class simulates an expensive initialization process. By using the `clone()` method, we can create a new instance without repeating the costly initialization.

#### Dynamic Object Structures

The Prototype Pattern allows objects to evolve at runtime, enabling dynamic changes to object structures without the need for subclassing.

```haxe
class DynamicObject implements Prototype<DynamicObject> {
    public var properties:Map<String, Dynamic>;

    public function new() {
        properties = new Map<String, Dynamic>();
    }

    public function clone():DynamicObject {
        var newObj = new DynamicObject();
        for (key in properties.keys()) {
            newObj.properties.set(key, properties.get(key));
        }
        return newObj;
    }
}

// Usage
var dynamicObj = new DynamicObject();
dynamicObj.properties.set("name", "Prototype");
dynamicObj.properties.set("version", 1.0);

var clonedObj = dynamicObj.clone();
clonedObj.properties.set("version", 2.0);

trace(dynamicObj.properties.get("version")); // Output: 1.0
trace(clonedObj.properties.get("version")); // Output: 2.0
```

In this example, the `DynamicObject` class uses a map to store properties, allowing the object structure to change dynamically. The `clone()` method creates a new instance with the same properties.

### Design Considerations

- **Shallow vs. Deep Copy**: Decide whether to perform a shallow or deep copy based on the object structure and requirements. A shallow copy duplicates the top-level structure, while a deep copy duplicates all nested objects.
- **Prototype Registry**: Consider using a prototype registry to manage and organize prototypes, especially in large systems with many prototypes.
- **Performance**: The Prototype Pattern can improve performance by reducing the cost of object creation, but be mindful of the overhead associated with cloning complex objects.

### Differences and Similarities

The Prototype Pattern is often compared to the Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns. While all three patterns deal with object creation, the Prototype Pattern focuses on cloning existing objects, whereas the Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns involve creating new instances through factory methods.

### Visualizing the Prototype Pattern

To better understand the Prototype Pattern, let's visualize the process of cloning an object using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Prototype {
        <<interface>>
        +clone() Prototype
    }
    
    class ConcretePrototype {
        +data: Int
        +clone() ConcretePrototype
    }
    
    class Client {
        +operation()
    }
    
    Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype
    Client --> Prototype
```

In this diagram, the `Prototype` interface defines the `clone()` method, which is implemented by the `ConcretePrototype` class. The `Client` class interacts with the `Prototype` interface to create new objects by cloning.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Prototype Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- **Change the data type** in the `ConcretePrototype` class and observe how the `clone()` method handles different types.
- **Implement a deep copy** in the `ExpensiveObject` class by duplicating nested objects.
- **Add new properties** to the `DynamicObject` class and see how the `clone()` method adapts to changes.
