## 2.4 Generics and Type Parameters

Generics and type parameters are powerful features in Haxe that allow developers to write flexible and reusable code. By abstracting over types, you can create functions and classes that work with any data type while maintaining type safety. In this section, we'll delve into the intricacies of generics in Haxe, exploring how they enhance code reusability and type safety.

### Understanding Generics in Haxe

Generics enable you to define functions and classes with placeholders for data types. These placeholders, known as type parameters, are specified when the function or class is instantiated. This allows you to write code that is not tied to a specific data type, making it more versatile and reusable.

#### Generic Functions and Classes

Let's start by exploring generic functions. A generic function is defined with one or more type parameters, which are specified in angle brackets (`<>`) after the function name. Here's a simple example:

```haxe
// A generic function that swaps two elements in an array
function swap<T>(array: Array<T>, index1: Int, index2: Int): Void {
    var temp: T = array[index1];
    array[index1] = array[index2];
    array[index2] = temp;
}

// Usage
var intArray = [1, 2, 3];
swap(intArray, 0, 2); // Swaps the first and last elements
trace(intArray); // Output: [3, 2, 1]

var stringArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
swap(stringArray, 1, 2); // Swaps the second and third elements
trace(stringArray); // Output: ["a", "c", "b"]
```

In this example, the `swap` function is generic over the type parameter `T`. This means it can operate on arrays of any type, whether integers, strings, or any other type.

Similarly, you can define generic classes. Here's an example of a generic class representing a simple stack:

```haxe
// A generic stack class
class Stack<T> {
    private var elements: Array<T> = [];

    public function push(element: T): Void {
        elements.push(element);
    }

    public function pop(): T {
        return elements.pop();
    }

    public function isEmpty(): Bool {
        return elements.length == 0;
    }
}

// Usage
var intStack = new Stack<Int>();
intStack.push(1);
intStack.push(2);
trace(intStack.pop()); // Output: 2

var stringStack = new Stack<String>();
stringStack.push("hello");
stringStack.push("world");
trace(stringStack.pop()); // Output: "world"
```

The `Stack` class is generic over the type parameter `T`, allowing it to store elements of any type.

### Constraints and Bounds

While generics provide flexibility, there are times when you want to restrict the types that can be used as type parameters. This is where constraints and bounds come into play. In Haxe, you can use constraints to specify that a type parameter must be a subtype of a particular type.

#### Using Constraints

Consider a scenario where you want to create a function that operates on objects implementing a specific interface. You can use constraints to enforce this requirement:

```haxe
// Define an interface
interface Printable {
    public function print(): Void;
}

// A generic function with a constraint
function printAll<T: Printable>(items: Array<T>): Void {
    for (item in items) {
        item.print();
    }
}

// Implement the Printable interface
class Document implements Printable {
    public function print(): Void {
        trace("Printing document...");
    }
}

// Usage
var documents = [new Document(), new Document()];
printAll(documents); // Prints each document
```

In this example, the `printAll` function is constrained to accept only arrays of objects that implement the `Printable` interface.

### Variance and Type Safety

Variance refers to how subtyping between more complex types relates to subtyping between their components. Understanding variance is crucial for maintaining type safety when using generics.

#### Covariance and Contravariance

In Haxe, variance is primarily concerned with how type parameters behave in relation to subtyping. There are two main types of variance:

- **Covariance**: Allows a generic type to be substituted with a subtype. This is useful when you want to ensure that a function can accept a more specific type than originally defined.
- **Contravariance**: Allows a generic type to be substituted with a supertype. This is useful when you want to ensure that a function can accept a more general type than originally defined.

Let's illustrate these concepts with an example:

```haxe
// Define a base class and a subclass
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

// A covariant function
function feedAnimals(animals: Array<Animal>): Void {
    for (animal in animals) {
        trace("Feeding animal...");
    }
}

// Usage
var dogs: Array<Dog> = [new Dog(), new Dog()];
feedAnimals(dogs); // Works because Array<Dog> is a subtype of Array<Animal>
```

In this example, `Array<Dog>` can be used where `Array<Animal>` is expected, demonstrating covariance.

### Practical Applications of Generics

Generics are not just a theoretical concept; they have practical applications that can greatly enhance your code. Let's explore some common use cases for generics in Haxe.

#### Collections and Data Structures

Generics are particularly useful when working with collections and data structures. By using generics, you can create data structures that are type-safe and reusable across different types of data.

Consider a generic linked list implementation:

```haxe
// A generic linked list node
class Node<T> {
    public var value: T;
    public var next: Node<T>;

    public function new(value: T) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

// A generic linked list
class LinkedList<T> {
    private var head: Node<T>;

    public function add(value: T): Void {
        var newNode = new Node<T>(value);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            var current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }

    public function printList(): Void {
        var current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            trace(current.value);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}

// Usage
var intList = new LinkedList<Int>();
intList.add(1);
intList.add(2);
intList.printList(); // Output: 1 2

var stringList = new LinkedList<String>();
stringList.add("hello");
stringList.add("world");
stringList.printList(); // Output: hello world
```

This linked list implementation can store elements of any type, thanks to the use of generics.

#### Algorithms and Utilities

Generics are also useful for implementing algorithms and utility functions that work with different data types. For example, you can create a generic sorting function that can sort arrays of any type:

```haxe
// A generic sorting function
function sort<T>(array: Array<T>, compare: (T, T) -> Int): Void {
    array.sort(compare);
}

// Usage
var numbers = [3, 1, 2];
sort(numbers, (a, b) -> a - b);
trace(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3]

var words = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"];
sort(words, (a, b) -> a.compare(b));
trace(words); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

The `sort` function uses a comparator function to determine the order of elements, making it applicable to any type of array.

### Visualizing Generics and Type Parameters

To better understand how generics and type parameters work, let's visualize the concept using a class diagram. This diagram illustrates the relationship between a generic class and its type parameters.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Stack<T> {
        -Array~T~ elements
        +push(T element)
        +pop() T
        +isEmpty() Bool
    }
    class IntStack {
        +push(Int element)
        +pop() Int
        +isEmpty() Bool
    }
    class StringStack {
        +push(String element)
        +pop() String
        +isEmpty() Bool
    }
    Stack<T> <|-- IntStack
    Stack<T> <|-- StringStack
```

In this diagram, `Stack<T>` is a generic class with a type parameter `T`. `IntStack` and `StringStack` are specific instances of the `Stack` class with `Int` and `String` as their type parameters, respectively.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of generics and type parameters in Haxe, it's time to experiment with the concepts. Try modifying the code examples to deepen your understanding:

1. **Create a Generic Queue**: Implement a generic queue class similar to the stack example. Ensure it supports enqueue and dequeue operations.

2. **Add Constraints**: Modify the `LinkedList` class to only accept elements that implement a specific interface. Test it with different types.

3. **Experiment with Variance**: Create a function that demonstrates contravariance by accepting a supertype of a generic type parameter.

### Key Takeaways
