import h2d.Bitmap;

class Main extends App {
    override function init() {
        var scene = new Scene();
        var bitmap = new Bitmap(scene, "assets/image.png");
        bitmap.x = 100;
        bitmap.y = 100;
    }
}
```

> **Try It Yourself:** Modify the code to change the position of the bitmap or load a different image to see how Heaps handles assets.

#### OpenFL

**OpenFL** is a framework that mirrors the Flash API, enabling developers to create rich multimedia applications. It is particularly popular among developers who have experience with Flash and ActionScript.

- **Features:**
  - **Flash-Like API:** OpenFL provides an API similar to Flash, making it easy for developers familiar with Flash to transition to Haxe.

  - Suitable for projects that require rich multimedia content and animations.

- **Code Example:**

```haxe
import openfl.display.Sprite;
import openfl.text.TextField;

class Main extends Sprite {
    public function new() {
        super();
        var textField = new TextField();
        textField.text = "Hello, OpenFL!";
        addChild(textField);
    }
}
```

> **Try It Yourself:** Experiment with different text properties or add more graphical elements to explore OpenFL's capabilities.

class Main extends FlxGame {
    public function new() {
        super(640, 480, PlayState);
    }
}

class PlayState extends FlxState {
    override public function create():Void {
        var text = new FlxText(0, 0, 100, "Hello, HaxeFlixel!");
        add(text);
    }
}
```

```haxe
import kha.System;
import kha.Framebuffer;
import kha.graphics4.Graphics;

class Main {
    static function main() {
        System.init({title: "Kha Example"}, init);
    }

    static function init() {
        System.notifyOnRender(render);
    }

    static function render(framebuffer: Framebuffer) {
        var g = framebuffer.g4;
        g.begin();
        g.clear(0, 0, 0, 1);
        // Add rendering code here
        g.end();
    }
}
```
