## 6.5 Mediator Design Pattern

In the realm of software design, the **Mediator Design Pattern** stands out as a pivotal tool for managing complex interactions between objects. By encapsulating how objects interact, the Mediator Pattern promotes loose coupling, thereby enhancing the maintainability and scalability of your code. In this section, we will delve deep into the Mediator Pattern, exploring its implementation in Dart and Flutter, and examining its practical applications through comprehensive examples.

### Understanding the Mediator Design Pattern

The Mediator Pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to communicate with each other, but direct communication would lead to a tangled web of dependencies. By introducing a mediator, we can centralize communication, allowing objects to interact indirectly through the mediator.

#### Key Concepts

- **Loose Coupling**: The Mediator Pattern reduces dependencies between communicating objects, promoting a more modular and flexible architecture.
- **Centralized Control**: The mediator acts as a central hub for communication, managing the interactions between objects.
- **Simplified Object Interactions**: Objects no longer need to be aware of each other, simplifying their interactions and responsibilities.

### Implementing the Mediator Pattern in Dart

To implement the Mediator Pattern in Dart, we need to define a few key components:

1. **Mediator Interface**: This interface declares the methods used by components to communicate with the mediator.
2. **Concrete Mediator**: This class implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between components.
3. **Colleague Classes**: These are the components that communicate via the mediator.

#### Mediator Interface

The mediator interface defines the contract for communication. It typically includes methods for sending and receiving messages or events.

```dart
abstract class Mediator {
  void notify(Object sender, String event);
}
```

#### Concrete Mediator

The concrete mediator implements the mediator interface and contains the logic for coordinating communication between colleague classes.

```dart
class ConcreteMediator implements Mediator {
  late ComponentA componentA;
  late ComponentB componentB;

  @override
  void notify(Object sender, String event) {
    if (event == 'A') {
      print('Mediator reacts on A and triggers B');
      componentB.doB();
    }
    if (event == 'B') {
      print('Mediator reacts on B and triggers A');
      componentA.doA();
    }
  }
}
```

#### Colleague Classes

Colleague classes are the components that interact through the mediator. They hold a reference to the mediator and use it to communicate.

```dart
class ComponentA {
  final Mediator mediator;

  ComponentA(this.mediator);

  void doA() {
    print('Component A does A.');
    mediator.notify(this, 'A');
  }
}

class ComponentB {
  final Mediator mediator;

  ComponentB(this.mediator);

  void doB() {
    print('Component B does B.');
    mediator.notify(this, 'B');
  }
}
```

#### Putting It All Together

Let's see how these components work together in a simple example.

```dart
void main() {
  ConcreteMediator mediator = ConcreteMediator();
  ComponentA componentA = ComponentA(mediator);
  ComponentB componentB = ComponentB(mediator);

  mediator.componentA = componentA;
  mediator.componentB = componentB;

  print('Client triggers operation A.');
  componentA.doA();

  print('Client triggers operation B.');
  componentB.doB();
}
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Mediator Pattern is versatile and can be applied in various scenarios. Let's explore some common use cases and examples.

#### Chat Applications

In a chat application, the mediator can manage the communication between users, ensuring that messages are routed correctly without users needing to know about each other.

```dart
class ChatRoom implements Mediator {
  final List<User> users = [];

  void registerUser(User user) {
    users.add(user);
  }

  @override
  void notify(Object sender, String message) {
    for (var user in users) {
      if (user != sender) {
        user.receive(message);
      }
    }
  }
}

class User {
  final String name;
  final Mediator mediator;

  User(this.name, this.mediator);

  void send(String message) {
    print('$name sends: $message');
    mediator.notify(this, message);
  }

  void receive(String message) {
    print('$name receives: $message');
  }
}

void main() {
  ChatRoom chatRoom = ChatRoom();

  User user1 = User('Alice', chatRoom);
  User user2 = User('Bob', chatRoom);

  chatRoom.registerUser(user1);
  chatRoom.registerUser(user2);

  user1.send('Hello, Bob!');
  user2.send('Hi, Alice!');
}
```

#### Form Validation

In a complex form with multiple fields, the mediator can coordinate validation logic, ensuring that fields are validated in a consistent manner.

```dart
class FormMediator implements Mediator {
  late TextField usernameField;
  late TextField passwordField;

  @override
  void notify(Object sender, String event) {
    if (event == 'usernameChanged') {
      print('Validating username...');
      // Perform validation logic
    }
    if (event == 'passwordChanged') {
      print('Validating password...');
      // Perform validation logic
    }
  }
}

class TextField {
  final Mediator mediator;
  final String name;

  TextField(this.mediator, this.name);

  void change(String value) {
    print('$name changed to: $value');
    mediator.notify(this, '${name}Changed');
  }
}

void main() {
  FormMediator formMediator = FormMediator();
  TextField usernameField = TextField(formMediator, 'username');
  TextField passwordField = TextField(formMediator, 'password');

  formMediator.usernameField = usernameField;
  formMediator.passwordField = passwordField;

  usernameField.change('newUser');
  passwordField.change('newPassword');
}
```

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

To better understand the Mediator Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between components using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Mediator {
        <<interface>>
        +notify(Object sender, String event)
    }
    class ConcreteMediator {
        +notify(Object sender, String event)
    }
    class ComponentA {
        +doA()
    }
    class ComponentB {
        +doB()
    }
    Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
    ComponentA --> Mediator
    ComponentB --> Mediator
    ConcreteMediator o-- ComponentA
    ConcreteMediator o-- ComponentB
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Mediator Pattern, consider the following:

- **Complexity**: While the mediator simplifies object interactions, it can become a complex component itself if not managed properly.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure that the mediator only handles communication and does not take on additional responsibilities.
- **Performance**: In some cases, the mediator can become a bottleneck if it handles too many interactions.

### Differences and Similarities

The Mediator Pattern is often compared to the Observer Pattern. While both patterns manage communication between objects, the Mediator Pattern centralizes communication in a single mediator, whereas the Observer Pattern allows objects to communicate through a publish-subscribe mechanism.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Mediator Pattern, try modifying the examples provided:

- **Add More Components**: Extend the chat application to include more users and different types of messages.
- **Enhance Validation Logic**: In the form validation example, add more fields and complex validation rules.
- **Experiment with Different Mediators**: Create different mediators for different scenarios and observe how they manage communication.

### Conclusion

The Mediator Design Pattern is a powerful tool for managing complex interactions between objects. By centralizing communication, it promotes loose coupling and enhances the maintainability of your code. As you continue to explore design patterns in Dart and Flutter, remember that the Mediator Pattern is just one of many tools available to you. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
