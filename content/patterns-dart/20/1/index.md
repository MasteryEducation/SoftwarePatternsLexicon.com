## 20.1 Glossary of Terms

Welcome to the comprehensive glossary of terms for mastering Dart design patterns in Flutter development. This section serves as a reference to clarify technical terms, acronyms, and concepts used throughout the guide. Understanding these terms is crucial for effectively applying design patterns in your Dart and Flutter projects.

### A

**Abstract Class**  
An abstract class in Dart is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is used as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by subclasses.

```dart
abstract class Animal {
  void makeSound(); // Abstract method
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Bark');
  }
}
```

**Abstraction**  
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

**Adapter Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

**Algorithm**  
A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. In programming, algorithms are implemented in code to perform specific tasks.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**  
A set of rules and tools for building software applications. It defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with an external system or library.

### B

**Behavioral Design Patterns**  
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

**BLoC (Business Logic Component)**  
A design pattern used in Flutter to manage state and separate business logic from UI code. It uses streams to handle data flow and state management.

**Builder Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

### C

**Class**  
A blueprint for creating objects (instances). A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.

**Closure**  
A function object that has access to variables in its lexical scope, even when the function is used outside that scope.

```dart
Function makeAdder(int addBy) {
  return (int i) => addBy + i;
}

void main() {
  var add2 = makeAdder(2);
  print(add2(3)); // Outputs: 5
}
```

**Command Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Composition Over Inheritance**  
A principle that suggests using composition (having objects of other classes as members) instead of inheritance to achieve code reuse and flexibility.

### D

**Dart**  
A client-optimized programming language for fast apps on any platform. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.

**Dependency Injection**  
A design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class through different ways.

**Design Pattern**  
A general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

**DTO (Data Transfer Object)**  
An object that carries data between processes. It is used to encapsulate data and send it from one subsystem of an application to another.

### E

**Encapsulation**  
An OOP principle that restricts access to certain components of an object and can prevent the accidental modification of data. It is achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.

**Extension Methods**  
A feature in Dart that allows you to add new functionality to existing libraries. They enable you to add methods to any type without modifying the source code.

```dart
extension NumberParsing on String {
  int toInt() {
    return int.parse(this);
  }
}

void main() {
  print('123'.toInt()); // Outputs: 123
}
```

**Event Loop**  
A programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It is a core part of asynchronous programming in Dart.

### F

**Facade Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

**Factory Method Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Flutter**  
An open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

**Functional Programming**  
A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes the use of pure functions and avoiding shared state and mutable data.

### G

**Generics**  
A feature in Dart that allows you to create classes, methods, and interfaces that work with any data type. Generics enable code reusability and type safety.

```dart
class Box<T> {
  T value;
  Box(this.value);
}

void main() {
  var intBox = Box<int>(10);
  var stringBox = Box<String>('Hello');
}
```

**GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)**  
A set of guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in object-oriented design. It includes patterns like Information Expert, Creator, and Controller.

### H

**Higher-Order Function**  
A function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are a key feature of functional programming.

### I

**Immutable Data Structures**  
Data structures that cannot be modified after they are created. They help in maintaining consistency and avoiding side effects in functional programming.

**Inheritance**  
An OOP principle where a new class is created from an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class.

**Interface**  
A way to define a contract in Dart. An interface defines methods that a class must implement, but it does not provide the implementation itself.

### J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**  
A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection.

### K

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**  
A design principle that states that simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

### L

**Lazy Initialization**  
A design pattern that defers the creation of an object until it is needed. It can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations or memory usage.

**Law of Demeter**  
A design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. It suggests that a module should not know about the internal details of the objects it manipulates.

### M

**Memento Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state. It is useful for implementing undo mechanisms.

**Mixin**  
A class that provides methods to other classes but is not considered a base class itself. Mixins are used to add functionality to classes in Dart.

```dart
mixin Swimmer {
  void swim() {
    print('Swimming');
  }
}

class Fish with Swimmer {}

void main() {
  Fish fish = Fish();
  fish.swim(); // Outputs: Swimming
}
```

**MVC (Model-View-Controller)**  
A design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: Model, View, and Controller. Each of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

### N

**Null Safety**  
A feature in Dart that helps you avoid null errors by making all types non-nullable by default. You must explicitly declare a variable as nullable if it can hold a null value.

### O

**Observer Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
A programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### P

**Polymorphism**  
An OOP principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

**Prototype Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that allows cloning of objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

**Provider Pattern**  
A design pattern used in Flutter for managing state. It involves using a provider to expose data to the widget tree and notify listeners when the data changes.

### Q

**Queue**  
A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is used in programming to manage tasks or data that need to be processed in order.

### R

**Reactive Programming**  
A programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. It is used in Dart to handle asynchronous data streams.

**Repository Pattern**  
A design pattern that mediates data from and to the domain and data mapping layers. It provides a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

### S

**Singleton Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance. It is useful for managing shared resources or configurations.

```dart
class Singleton {
  Singleton._privateConstructor();

  static final Singleton _instance = Singleton._privateConstructor();

  factory Singleton() {
    return _instance;
  }
}
```

**SOLID Principles**  
A set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They include Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.

**State Management**  
The process of managing the state of an application. In Flutter, state management involves managing the state of widgets and ensuring that the UI reflects the current state of the application.

### T

**Template Method Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

**Type Inference**  
A feature in Dart that allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable based on its value. It reduces the need for explicit type annotations.

### U

**UI (User Interface)**  
The space where interactions between humans and machines occur. In Flutter, the UI is built using widgets, which are the building blocks of the application.

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)**  
A standardized modeling language used to visualize the design of a system. It includes various types of diagrams, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams.

### V

**Visitor Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures.

### W

**Widget**  
A basic building block of a Flutter application. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state.

### X

**XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**  
A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is often used for data interchange between systems.

### Y

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**  
A principle of extreme programming that states you should not add functionality until it is necessary. It helps in avoiding unnecessary complexity in software development.

### Z

**Zero-Cost Abstraction**  
A concept in programming where abstractions do not incur any runtime overhead. In Dart, this is achieved through features like inlining and efficient memory management.
