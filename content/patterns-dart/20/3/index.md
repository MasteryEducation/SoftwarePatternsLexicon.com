### Creational Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Singleton {
          - Singleton instance
          + getInstance() Singleton
      }
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Singleton class
- **Applicability**: Use when exactly one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
- **Design Considerations**: Be cautious of thread safety in concurrent environments. Dart's `factory` constructors can be used to implement singletons.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Often confused with static classes, but singletons can implement interfaces and be subclassed.

#### Factory Method Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Creator {
          + factoryMethod() Product
      }
      class ConcreteCreator {
          + factoryMethod() ConcreteProduct
      }
      class Product
      class ConcreteProduct
      Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
      Product <|-- ConcreteProduct
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Creator, ConcreteCreator, Product, ConcreteProduct
- **Applicability**: Use when a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- **Design Considerations**: Promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into your code.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Similar to Abstract Factory, but focuses on creating a single product.

#### Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class AbstractFactory {
          + createProductA() ProductA
          + createProductB() ProductB
      }
      class ConcreteFactory1 {
          + createProductA() ProductA1
          + createProductB() ProductB1
      }
      class ProductA
      class ProductB
      class ProductA1
      class ProductB1
      AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory1
      ProductA <|-- ProductA1
      ProductB <|-- ProductB1
  ```
- **Key Participants**: AbstractFactory, ConcreteFactory, ProductA, ProductB
- **Applicability**: Use when the system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- **Design Considerations**: Ensures consistency among products by enforcing that they are created by the same factory.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Often used with Factory Method, but Abstract Factory focuses on families of products.

#### Builder Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Builder {
          + buildPart() void
      }
      class ConcreteBuilder {
          + buildPart() void
          + getResult() Product
      }
      class Director {
          + construct() void
      }
      class Product
      Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder
      Director --> Builder
      ConcreteBuilder --> Product
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Builder, ConcreteBuilder, Director, Product
- **Applicability**: Use when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
- **Design Considerations**: Useful for constructing objects with many optional parts or configurations.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Similar to Factory Method, but focuses on constructing a complex object step by step.

#### Prototype Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

          + clone() Prototype
      }
      class ConcretePrototype
      Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Prototype, ConcretePrototype
- **Applicability**: Use when a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented, and when the classes to instantiate are specified at runtime.

- **Differences and Similarities**: Similar to Singleton, but manages multiple instances.

#### Dependency Injection Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Separate the creation of a client's dependencies from the client's behavior, allowing the client to be configured with its dependencies.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
      class Client {
          + setService(Service) void
      }
      class Service
      Client --> Service
  ```
