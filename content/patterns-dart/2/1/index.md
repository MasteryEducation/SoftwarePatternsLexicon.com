## 2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several core principles to create modular, reusable, and scalable code. In Dart, OOP is a fundamental aspect that enhances the development of robust Flutter applications. Let's delve into the key OOP concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. Encapsulation is achieved using classes in Dart.

#### Key Concepts of Encapsulation

- **Data Hiding**: Protects the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse.
- **Public and Private Members**: Dart uses underscores (_) to denote private members.
- **Getter and Setter Methods**: Provide controlled access to private properties.

#### Code Example: Encapsulation in Dart

```dart
class BankAccount {
  // Private member variable
  double _balance;

  // Constructor
  BankAccount(this._balance);

  // Getter for balance
  double get balance => _balance;

  // Method to deposit money
  void deposit(double amount) {
    if (amount > 0) {
      _balance += amount;
    }
  }

  // Method to withdraw money
  void withdraw(double amount) {
    if (amount > 0 && amount <= _balance) {
      _balance -= amount;
    }
  }
}

void main() {
  var account = BankAccount(1000);
  account.deposit(500);
  account.withdraw(200);
  print('Current balance: ${account.balance}');
}
```

In this example, the `_balance` variable is private, and access to it is controlled through the `balance` getter and the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods.

### Abstraction

**Abstraction** is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. In Dart, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

#### Key Concepts of Abstraction

- **Abstract Classes**: Cannot be instantiated and are used to define common behavior for subclasses.
- **Interfaces**: Define a contract that implementing classes must fulfill.

#### Code Example: Abstraction in Dart

```dart
abstract class Vehicle {
  void start();
  void stop();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
  @override
  void start() {
    print('Car started');
  }

  @override
  void stop() {
    print('Car stopped');
  }
}

void main() {
  Vehicle myCar = Car();
  myCar.start();
  myCar.stop();
}
```

Here, `Vehicle` is an abstract class with two methods, `start` and `stop`. The `Car` class implements these methods, providing specific functionality.

### Inheritance

**Inheritance** allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a subtype from an existing object.

#### Key Concepts of Inheritance

- **Base Class (Superclass)**: The class being inherited from.
- **Derived Class (Subclass)**: The class that inherits from the base class.
- **Method Overriding**: Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

#### Code Example: Inheritance in Dart

```dart
class Animal {
  void eat() {
    print('Animal is eating');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @override
  void eat() {
    print('Dog is eating');
  }

  void bark() {
    print('Dog is barking');
  }
}

void main() {
  Dog myDog = Dog();
  myDog.eat(); // Calls overridden method
  myDog.bark();
}
```

In this example, `Dog` inherits from `Animal` and overrides the `eat` method to provide specific behavior.

### Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).

#### Key Concepts of Polymorphism

- **Compile-time Polymorphism**: Achieved through method overloading.
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Achieved through method overriding.

#### Code Example: Polymorphism in Dart

```dart
class Shape {
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a shape');
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  @override
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a circle');
  }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  @override
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a square');
  }
}

void main() {
  List<Shape> shapes = [Circle(), Square()];
  for (var shape in shapes) {
    shape.draw(); // Calls the overridden method
  }
}
```

In this example, both `Circle` and `Square` override the `draw` method of the `Shape` class, demonstrating polymorphism.

### Visualizing OOP Concepts

To better understand these concepts, let's visualize the relationships between classes using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BankAccount {
        -double _balance
        +double get balance()
        +void deposit(double amount)
        +void withdraw(double amount)
    }

    class Vehicle {
        <<abstract>>
        +void start()
        +void stop()
    }

    class Car {
        +void start()
        +void stop()
    }

    Vehicle <|-- Car

    class Animal {
        +void eat()
    }

    class Dog {
        +void eat()
        +void bark()
    }

    Animal <|-- Dog

    class Shape {
        +void draw()
    }

    class Circle {
        +void draw()
    }

    class Square {
        +void draw()
    }

    Shape <|-- Circle
    Shape <|-- Square
```

This diagram illustrates the inheritance and implementation relationships between classes, highlighting how OOP principles are applied in Dart.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples:

- **Encapsulation**: Add a method to transfer funds between two `BankAccount` objects.
- **Abstraction**: Create a new class `Bike` that implements the `Vehicle` interface.
- **Inheritance**: Add a new subclass `Cat` that extends `Animal` and overrides the `eat` method.
- **Polymorphism**: Add a new shape class `Triangle` and include it in the list of shapes to draw.

### Knowledge Check

- **What is encapsulation, and why is it important?**
- **How does abstraction simplify code complexity?**
- **What are the benefits of using inheritance in Dart?**
- **How does polymorphism enhance flexibility in code?**

### Embrace the Journey

Remember, mastering OOP in Dart is a journey. As you continue to explore these concepts, you'll find new ways to apply them in your Flutter applications. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the process of learning and growing as a developer.
