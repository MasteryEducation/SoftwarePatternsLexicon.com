### Visualizing Design Patterns

To enhance your understanding of design patterns, let's visualize some of the key concepts using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Singleton Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -Singleton instance
        +getInstance() Singleton
        +operation()
    }
    Singleton --|> Singleton : instance
```

**Description:** This diagram illustrates the Singleton pattern, where a single instance of a class is created and accessed globally.

#### Factory Method Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Creator {
        +factoryMethod() Product
    }
    class ConcreteCreator {
        +factoryMethod() ConcreteProduct
    }
    class Product
    class ConcreteProduct
    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Product <|-- ConcreteProduct
    Creator --> Product : factoryMethod
```

**Description:** This diagram shows the Factory Method pattern, where a creator class defines a method for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
