## 5.4 Decorator Design Pattern

The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful in Dart and Flutter development for enhancing the functionality of widgets and data streams in a flexible and reusable manner.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Decorator Pattern is to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. This pattern is especially beneficial when you want to add features to objects without modifying their structure or creating a complex inheritance hierarchy.

### Key Participants

1. **Component Interface**: This defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically. Both concrete components and decorators implement this interface.

2. **Concrete Component**: This is the class of objects to which additional responsibilities can be attached.

3. **Decorator Class**: This class wraps a component and provides additional behavior. It maintains a reference to a component object and defines an interface that conforms to the component's interface.

4. **Concrete Decorators**: These are classes that extend the functionality of the component by adding new behavior.

### Applicability

Use the Decorator Pattern when:

- You need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
- You want to extend the behavior of classes in a flexible and reusable way.
- You want to avoid an explosion of subclasses to support every combination of features.

### Implementing Decorator in Dart

#### Component Interface

In Dart, the component interface can be defined using an abstract class or an interface. This interface will be implemented by both the concrete component and the decorators.

```dart
abstract class Coffee {
  String getDescription();
  double cost();
}
```

#### Concrete Component

The concrete component implements the component interface. It represents the core object to which additional responsibilities can be added.

```dart
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
  @override
  String getDescription() => "Simple Coffee";

  @override
  double cost() => 5.0;
}
```

#### Decorator Class

The decorator class also implements the component interface and contains a reference to a component object. It delegates the component's behavior to the component object and can add its own behavior.

```dart
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
  final Coffee coffee;

  CoffeeDecorator(this.coffee);

  @override
  String getDescription() => coffee.getDescription();

  @override
  double cost() => coffee.cost();
}
```

#### Concrete Decorators

Concrete decorators extend the functionality of the component by adding new behavior.

```dart
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
  MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) : super(coffee);

  @override
  String getDescription() => "${coffee.getDescription()}, Milk";

  @override
  double cost() => coffee.cost() + 1.5;
}

class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
  SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) : super(coffee);

  @override
  String getDescription() => "${coffee.getDescription()}, Sugar";

  @override
  double cost() => coffee.cost() + 0.5;
}
```

#### Usage Example

```dart
void main() {
  Coffee coffee = SimpleCoffee();
  print("${coffee.getDescription()} costs \$${coffee.cost()}");

  coffee = MilkDecorator(coffee);
  print("${coffee.getDescription()} costs \$${coffee.cost()}");

  coffee = SugarDecorator(coffee);
  print("${coffee.getDescription()} costs \$${coffee.cost()}");
}
```

### Visualizing the Decorator Pattern

To better understand the Decorator Pattern, let's visualize the relationships between the components using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Coffee {
        <<interface>>
        +String getDescription()
        +double cost()
    }
    class SimpleCoffee {
        +String getDescription()
        +double cost()
    }
    class CoffeeDecorator {
        +Coffee coffee
        +String getDescription()
        +double cost()
    }
    class MilkDecorator {
        +String getDescription()
        +double cost()
    }
    class SugarDecorator {
        +String getDescription()
        +double cost()
    }

    Coffee <|-- SimpleCoffee
    Coffee <|-- CoffeeDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- MilkDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- SugarDecorator
    Coffee o-- CoffeeDecorator
```

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Enhancing Widgets

In Flutter, the Decorator Pattern is often used to enhance widgets by adding decoration, padding, or behavior. For example, you can create a custom widget decorator that adds a border or shadow to an existing widget.

```dart
class BorderDecorator extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;

  BorderDecorator({required this.child});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        border: Border.all(color: Colors.blue, width: 2.0),
      ),
      child: child,
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: BorderDecorator(
            child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

#### Modifying Data Streams

The Decorator Pattern can also be applied to modify data streams. For instance, you can create a stream decorator that transforms data as it flows through the stream.

```dart
Stream<int> addFive(Stream<int> input) async* {
  await for (var value in input) {
    yield value + 5;
  }
}

void main() async {
  final stream = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
  final decoratedStream = addFive(stream);

  await for (var value in decoratedStream) {
    print(value); // Outputs: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
  }
}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Decorator Pattern in Dart, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Each decorator adds a layer of abstraction, which can impact performance. Use decorators judiciously to avoid excessive overhead.
- **Complexity**: While decorators provide flexibility, they can also increase the complexity of the code. Ensure that the added complexity is justified by the benefits.
- **Dart Features**: Take advantage of Dart's features such as mixins and extensions to enhance the functionality of decorators.

### Differences and Similarities

The Decorator Pattern is often confused with the Proxy Pattern. While both patterns involve wrapping an object, they serve different purposes:

- **Decorator Pattern**: Focuses on adding new behavior to an object.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Decorator Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided:

- Create additional decorators for the coffee example, such as `WhippedCreamDecorator` or `CaramelDecorator`.
- Experiment with different widget decorators in Flutter, such as adding shadows or gradients.
- Modify the data stream example to perform different transformations, such as multiplying values or filtering them.
