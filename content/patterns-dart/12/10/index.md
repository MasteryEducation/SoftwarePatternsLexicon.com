## 12.10 Error Handling and Retrying Requests

In the world of mobile and web applications, network requests are a fundamental part of interacting with external services. However, network interactions are inherently unreliable due to factors like connectivity issues, server downtime, and latency. As Dart and Flutter developers, mastering error handling and implementing retry logic is crucial for building robust applications that provide a seamless user experience even in the face of network failures.

In this section, we will explore various strategies for handling errors and retrying requests in Dart and Flutter applications. We will cover timeouts, cancellations, user experience considerations, and best practices for implementing these strategies effectively.

### Understanding Network Errors

Before diving into error handling strategies, it's important to understand the types of network errors that can occur:

1. **Connection Errors**: These occur when the device is unable to establish a connection to the server. This can be due to network unavailability, incorrect URLs, or server downtime.

2. **Timeout Errors**: These happen when a request takes too long to complete. This can be due to slow network speeds or server processing delays.

3. **HTTP Errors**: These are errors returned by the server, such as 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), etc.

4. **Parsing Errors**: These occur when the response data cannot be parsed correctly, often due to unexpected data formats.

### Implementing Error Handling in Dart

Error handling in Dart can be achieved using try-catch blocks, which allow us to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully. Let's look at a basic example of handling network errors using the `http` package.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final url = 'https://api.example.com/data';

  try {
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(url));

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
      print('Data fetched successfully: $data');
    } else {
      print('Server error: ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('Network error: $e');
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the network request. We also check the HTTP status code to handle server errors.

### Retry Logic for Network Requests

Retry logic is essential for handling transient network errors that may resolve themselves after a short delay. Implementing retry logic involves defining a strategy for when and how to retry failed requests.

#### Exponential Backoff Strategy

One common retry strategy is exponential backoff, where the delay between retries increases exponentially. This helps to reduce the load on the server and network.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchDataWithRetry() async {
  final url = 'https://api.example.com/data';
  int retryCount = 0;
  const maxRetries = 5;

  while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
      final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(url));

      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
        print('Data fetched successfully: $data');
        return;
      } else {
        print('Server error: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('Network error: $e');
    }

    retryCount++;
    final delay = Duration(seconds: 2 * retryCount);
    print('Retrying in ${delay.inSeconds} seconds...');
    await Future.delayed(delay);
  }

  print('Failed to fetch data after $maxRetries retries.');
}
```

In this example, we retry the request up to a maximum number of times, with an increasing delay between each retry.

### Managing Timeouts and Cancellations

Timeouts and cancellations are important for managing long-running or hanging requests. Dart provides built-in support for timeouts using the `timeout` method.

#### Implementing Timeouts

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchDataWithTimeout() async {
  final url = 'https://api.example.com/data';

  try {
    final response = await http
        .get(Uri.parse(url))
        .timeout(Duration(seconds: 5));

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
      print('Data fetched successfully: $data');
    } else {
      print('Server error: ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('Request timed out or network error: $e');
  }
}
```

In this example, we set a timeout of 5 seconds for the network request. If the request takes longer than this, a `TimeoutException` is thrown.

#### Handling Cancellations

Cancellations are useful for aborting requests that are no longer needed, such as when a user navigates away from a page. Dart's `http` package does not support request cancellation directly, but you can achieve this using a combination of `Completer` and `Future`.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchDataWithCancellation() async {
  final url = 'https://api.example.com/data';
  final completer = Completer<void>();

  final request = http.get(Uri.parse(url)).then((response) {
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
      print('Data fetched successfully: $data');
    } else {
      print('Server error: ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  }).catchError((e) {
    print('Network error: $e');
  });

  // Simulate a cancellation after 2 seconds
  Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
    if (!completer.isCompleted) {
      print('Request cancelled');
      completer.complete();
    }
  });

  await completer.future;
}
```

In this example, we use a `Completer` to simulate a cancellation after 2 seconds. This approach can be adapted to cancel requests based on user actions.

### Enhancing User Experience

Providing feedback to users during network interactions is crucial for a good user experience. Here are some strategies to enhance user experience:

1. **Loading Indicators**: Display loading indicators while waiting for network requests to complete.

2. **Error Messages**: Show user-friendly error messages when a request fails.

3. **Retry Options**: Provide users with the option to retry failed requests.

4. **Fallback Content**: Display cached or default content when a request fails.

#### Example: User Feedback with Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class DataFetcher extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DataFetcherState createState() => _DataFetcherState();
}

class _DataFetcherState extends State<DataFetcher> {
  bool _isLoading = false;
  String _data = '';
  String _error = '';

  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true;
      _error = '';
    });

    final url = 'https://api.example.com/data';

    try {
      final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(url));

      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
        setState(() {
          _data = data.toString();
        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          _error = 'Server error: ${response.statusCode}';
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _error = 'Network error: $e';
      });
    } finally {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Data Fetcher'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _isLoading
            ? CircularProgressIndicator()
            : _error.isNotEmpty
                ? Column(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                    children: [
                      Text(_error),
                      ElevatedButton(
                        onPressed: _fetchData,
                        child: Text('Retry'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  )
                : Text('Data: $_data'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _fetchData,
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this Flutter example, we provide user feedback with a loading indicator, error messages, and a retry button.

### Best Practices for Error Handling and Retrying Requests

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure your application can function with limited or no network connectivity by providing offline capabilities or cached data.

2. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging to track network errors and monitor application performance.

3. **Configurable Retry Policies**: Allow retry policies to be configurable, enabling different strategies for different network conditions.

4. **User Feedback**: Always provide clear and actionable feedback to users when errors occur.

5. **Testing**: Test your error handling and retry logic under various network conditions to ensure reliability.

### Visualizing Error Handling and Retry Logic

To better understand the flow of error handling and retry logic, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant Server

    User->>App: Initiate Request
    App->>Server: Send Request
    Server-->>App: Response/Error
    alt Response is Error
        App->>App: Handle Error
        App->>User: Show Error Message
        App->>User: Offer Retry Option
        User->>App: Retry Request
        App->>Server: Resend Request
    else Response is Success
        App->>User: Display Data
    end
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the user, the app, and the server during a network request, highlighting the error handling and retry logic.
