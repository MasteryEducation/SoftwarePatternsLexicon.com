## 8.6 Concurrency Best Practices

Concurrency is a powerful tool in software development, enabling applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In Dart, concurrency is primarily achieved through asynchronous programming using `Futures`, `Streams`, and `Isolates`. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Mismanaging concurrency can lead to race conditions, deadlocks, and other issues that can compromise the stability and performance of your applications. In this section, we will explore best practices for managing concurrency in Dart, focusing on avoiding race conditions and deadlocks, using immutable data, managing resources effectively, and implementing cancellation tokens.

### Understanding Concurrency Challenges

Before diving into best practices, it's essential to understand the common challenges associated with concurrency:

- **Race Conditions**: Occur when two or more threads or tasks attempt to modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.
- **Deadlocks**: Happen when two or more tasks are waiting for each other to release resources, causing a standstill.
- **Resource Management**: Involves ensuring that resources such as memory, file handles, and network connections are properly allocated and released.
- **Task Cancellation**: Refers to the ability to stop a task that is no longer needed, freeing up resources and improving responsiveness.

### Best Practices for Avoiding Race Conditions and Deadlocks

#### 1. Use Immutable Data

Immutable data structures are a cornerstone of safe concurrent programming. By ensuring that data cannot be modified once created, you eliminate the risk of race conditions. Dart provides several ways to work with immutable data:

- **Final and Const**: Use `final` and `const` keywords to create immutable variables and objects.

```dart
final List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // Immutable list
const pi = 3.14159; // Immutable constant
```

- **Immutable Collections**: Use packages like `built_collection` to create immutable collections.

```dart
import 'package:built_collection/built_collection.dart';

final BuiltList<int> immutableList = BuiltList<int>([1, 2, 3]);
```

- **Data Classes**: Use data classes to encapsulate immutable data.

```dart
class Point {
  final int x;
  final int y;

  const Point(this.x, this.y);
}
```

#### 2. Properly Manage Resources

Effective resource management is crucial for avoiding deadlocks and ensuring that your application runs smoothly. Here are some strategies:

- **Use `try-finally` Blocks**: Ensure that resources are released even if an error occurs.

```dart
void readFile(String path) {
  var file = File(path);
  try {
    // Read file
  } finally {
    file.close(); // Ensure file is closed
  }
}
```

- **Limit Resource Usage**: Use resource pools to limit the number of resources in use at any time.

```dart
class ResourcePool {
  final int maxResources;
  int _currentResources = 0;

  ResourcePool(this.maxResources);

  Future<void> acquire() async {
    while (_currentResources >= maxResources) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 100));
    }
    _currentResources++;
  }

  void release() {
    _currentResources--;
  }
}
```

- **Avoid Nested Locks**: Nested locks can lead to deadlocks. Instead, acquire all necessary locks at once.

#### 3. Asynchronous Initialization

Ensure that resources are ready before use by initializing them asynchronously. This is particularly important for resources that require network access or other asynchronous operations.

```dart
Future<void> initializeResource() async {
  var resource = await fetchResource();
  // Use resource
}
```

#### 4. Implement Cancellation Tokens

Cancellation tokens allow you to cancel tasks that are no longer needed, freeing up resources and improving responsiveness.

- **Create a Cancellation Token**: Use a `Completer` to create a cancellation token.

```dart
class CancellationToken {
  final Completer<void> _completer = Completer<void>();

  Future<void> get token => _completer.future;

  void cancel() {
    if (!_completer.isCompleted) {
      _completer.complete();
    }
  }
}
```

- **Use the Cancellation Token**: Check the token periodically in your asynchronous tasks.

```dart
Future<void> performTask(CancellationToken token) async {
  while (true) {
    if (token.token.isCompleted) {
      print('Task cancelled');
      return;
    }
    // Perform task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  }
}
```

### Visualizing Concurrency Challenges

To better understand the challenges of concurrency, let's visualize a scenario where multiple tasks compete for the same resource, leading to a race condition.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Task1
    participant Task2
    participant Resource

    Task1->>Resource: Request Access
    Task2->>Resource: Request Access
    Resource-->>Task1: Grant Access
    Task1->>Resource: Modify Data
    Resource-->>Task2: Grant Access
    Task2->>Resource: Modify Data
```

In this diagram, both Task1 and Task2 request access to the same resource. If the resource is not properly synchronized, Task2 may overwrite changes made by Task1, leading to a race condition.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Use Case 1: Asynchronous Initialization

Consider a scenario where you need to fetch data from a remote server before displaying it in your application. Asynchronous initialization ensures that the data is ready before use.

```dart
Future<void> fetchData() async {
  var data = await fetchFromServer();
  displayData(data);
}

Future<String> fetchFromServer() async {
  // Simulate network delay
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  return 'Data from server';
}

void displayData(String data) {
  print(data);
}
```

#### Use Case 2: Cancellation Tokens

Imagine a scenario where a user initiates a search operation but decides to cancel it before it completes. Cancellation tokens allow you to stop the search operation and free up resources.

```dart
void main() {
  var token = CancellationToken();
  performSearch(token);

  // Simulate user cancelling the search
  Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
    token.cancel();
  });
}

Future<void> performSearch(CancellationToken token) async {
  while (true) {
    if (token.token.isCompleted) {
      print('Search cancelled');
      return;
    }
    // Simulate search operation
    print('Searching...');
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 500));
  }
}
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided in this section. Try modifying the `fetchData` function to simulate a network error and see how it affects the application. Implement a cancellation token in a different context, such as a file download operation, and observe how it improves resource management.
