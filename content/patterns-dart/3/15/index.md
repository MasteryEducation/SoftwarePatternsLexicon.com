## 3.15 Functional Features: Closures and Lambdas

In this section, we delve into the functional programming features of Dart, focusing on closures and lambdas. These concepts are pivotal in writing concise, expressive, and efficient code. By mastering these features, you can leverage Dart's full potential in building robust Flutter applications.

### Introduction to Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions, also known as lambda expressions or closures, are functions defined without a name. They are often used as arguments to higher-order functions or for short-lived operations. In Dart, anonymous functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

#### Defining Anonymous Functions

In Dart, an anonymous function is defined using the `=>` syntax for single-expression functions or the `{}` syntax for multi-statement functions. Here's an example of both:

```dart
// Single-expression anonymous function
var add = (int a, int b) => a + b;

// Multi-statement anonymous function
var multiply = (int a, int b) {
  int result = a * b;
  return result;
};

// Using the functions
void main() {
  print(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
  print(multiply(4, 5)); // Output: 20
}
```

### Closures in Dart

Closures are functions that capture variables from their surrounding lexical scope. This means that a closure can access and modify variables declared outside its own scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

#### Understanding Closures

A closure is created when a function is defined within another function and references variables from the outer function. This allows the inner function to "close over" the environment in which it was created.

```dart
Function makeAdder(int addBy) {
  return (int i) => addBy + i;
}

void main() {
  var add2 = makeAdder(2);
  var add5 = makeAdder(5);

  print(add2(3)); // Output: 5
  print(add5(3)); // Output: 8
}
```

In this example, `makeAdder` returns a closure that captures the `addBy` variable. Each time `makeAdder` is called, a new closure is created with its own captured `addBy` value.

#### Visualizing Closures

To better understand closures, let's visualize how they capture variables from their environment.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[makeAdder Function] --> B[Closure Creation];
    B --> C[Captured Environment];
    C --> D[addBy Variable];
    D --> E[Closure Execution];
```

**Diagram Description:** This diagram illustrates the process of creating a closure in Dart. The `makeAdder` function creates a closure that captures the `addBy` variable from its environment. This captured environment is then used when the closure is executed.

### Functional Programming Techniques

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. Dart supports several functional programming techniques, including higher-order functions and immutability.

#### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This allows for more abstract and flexible code.

```dart
void printResult(int Function(int, int) operation, int a, int b) {
  print(operation(a, b));
}

void main() {
  printResult((a, b) => a + b, 3, 4); // Output: 7
  printResult((a, b) => a * b, 3, 4); // Output: 12
}
```

In this example, `printResult` is a higher-order function that takes an operation function as an argument and applies it to the given numbers.

#### Immutability

Immutability is a core concept in functional programming, where data structures are not modified after they are created. Instead, new data structures are created with the desired changes.

```dart
void main() {
  final List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  final List<int> newNumbers = [...numbers, 4];

  print(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
  print(newNumbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

In this example, the original list `numbers` remains unchanged, and a new list `newNumbers` is created with the additional element.

### Practical Applications of Closures and Lambdas

Closures and lambdas are widely used in Dart and Flutter for various purposes, such as event handling, asynchronous programming, and state management.

#### Event Handling

In Flutter, closures are often used as callbacks for handling events like button presses.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Closure Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              print('Button pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `onPressed` callback is a closure that captures the context in which it was created.

#### Asynchronous Programming

Closures are also used in asynchronous programming to handle future results.

```dart
Future<void> fetchData() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  print('Data fetched');
}

void main() {
  fetchData().then((_) {
    print('Operation complete');
  });
}
```

Here, the closure passed to `then` captures the environment and executes once the future is complete.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of closures and lambdas, try modifying the examples provided:

- **Modify the `makeAdder` function** to create a subtractor instead.
- **Experiment with higher-order functions** by creating a function that applies multiple operations to a list of numbers.
- **Create a Flutter app** that uses closures for managing state changes.

### Key Takeaways

- **Closures** capture variables from their surrounding scope, allowing functions to access and modify these variables even after the outer function has finished executing.
- **Lambdas** are anonymous functions that can be used for short-lived operations or passed as arguments to higher-order functions.
- **Functional programming techniques** in Dart, such as higher-order functions and immutability, enable more abstract and flexible code.
