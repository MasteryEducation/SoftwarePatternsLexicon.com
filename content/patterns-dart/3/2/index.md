## 3.2 Classes, Mixins, and Extensions

In the world of Dart programming, understanding the concepts of classes, mixins, and extensions is crucial for building robust and scalable applications. These features allow developers to create reusable, maintainable, and efficient code, which is especially important in Flutter development. In this section, we will delve into these concepts, providing a comprehensive guide to mastering them.

### Classes and Objects: Defining and Instantiating Classes

#### Understanding Classes in Dart

Classes are the blueprint for creating objects in Dart. They encapsulate data for the object and define behaviors through methods. A class in Dart is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name.

```dart
class Car {
  String brand;
  int year;

  // Constructor
  Car(this.brand, this.year);

  // Method
  void displayInfo() {
    print('Car brand: $brand, Year: $year');
  }
}
```

In the example above, `Car` is a class with two properties: `brand` and `year`. It also includes a constructor and a method `displayInfo`.

#### Instantiating Objects

To create an instance of a class, use the `new` keyword or simply call the constructor. Dart allows you to omit the `new` keyword for brevity.

```dart
void main() {
  Car myCar = Car('Toyota', 2020);
  myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: Car brand: Toyota, Year: 2020
}
```

#### Constructors in Dart

Dart provides several ways to define constructors:

- **Default Constructor**: Automatically provided if no constructor is defined.
- **Named Constructors**: Allow multiple ways to create an instance.

```dart
class Car {
  String brand;
  int year;

  // Named constructor
  Car.withBrand(this.brand) : year = 2021;

  void displayInfo() {
    print('Car brand: $brand, Year: $year');
  }
}

void main() {
  Car myCar = Car.withBrand('Honda');
  myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: Car brand: Honda, Year: 2021
}
```

#### Factory Constructors

Factory constructors are used when a constructor does not always create a new instance of its class. They can return an existing instance or a subclass instance.

```dart
class Logger {
  static final Logger _instance = Logger._internal();

  factory Logger() {
    return _instance;
  }

  Logger._internal();

  void log(String message) {
    print('Log: $message');
  }
}

void main() {
  Logger logger1 = Logger();
  Logger logger2 = Logger();
  print(logger1 == logger2); // Output: true
}
```

### Mixins: Adding Functionality to Classes Without Inheritance

#### What are Mixins?

Mixins are a way of reusing a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. They allow you to add functionality to classes without using inheritance. In Dart, mixins are defined using the `mixin` keyword.

```dart
mixin Electric {
  void charge() {
    print('Charging...');
  }
}

class Car {
  void drive() {
    print('Driving...');
  }
}

class ElectricCar extends Car with Electric {}

void main() {
  ElectricCar myCar = ElectricCar();
  myCar.drive(); // Output: Driving...
  myCar.charge(); // Output: Charging...
}
```

#### Using Mixins

Mixins are applied using the `with` keyword. A class can use multiple mixins, and they are applied in the order they are listed.

```dart
mixin Fly {
  void fly() {
    print('Flying...');
  }
}

class FlyingCar extends Car with Electric, Fly {}

void main() {
  FlyingCar myCar = FlyingCar();
  myCar.drive(); // Output: Driving...
  myCar.charge(); // Output: Charging...
  myCar.fly(); // Output: Flying...
}
```

#### Constraints on Mixins

Mixins can have constraints, meaning they can only be applied to classes that extend or implement a specific class.

```dart
class Vehicle {}

mixin Electric on Vehicle {
  void charge() {
    print('Charging...');
  }
}

class ElectricCar extends Vehicle with Electric {}

void main() {
  ElectricCar myCar = ElectricCar();
  myCar.charge(); // Output: Charging...
}
```

### Extension Methods: Adding New Methods to Existing Classes

#### Understanding Extension Methods

Extension methods allow you to add new functionality to existing libraries. They enable you to add methods to any type, even if you don't have access to the source code.

```dart
extension NumberParsing on String {
  int toInt() {
    return int.parse(this);
  }
}

void main() {
  print('123'.toInt()); // Output: 123
}
```

#### Creating Extension Methods

To create an extension method, use the `extension` keyword followed by the extension name and `on` keyword with the type you want to extend.

```dart
extension StringExtension on String {
  String capitalize() {
    return this[0].toUpperCase() + substring(1);
  }
}

void main() {
  print('hello'.capitalize()); // Output: Hello
}
```

#### Limitations of Extension Methods

While extension methods are powerful, they have limitations:

- They cannot override existing methods.
- They cannot access private members of the class they extend.

### Visualizing Class Hierarchies and Extensions

To better understand how classes, mixins, and extensions interact, let's visualize these relationships using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Car {
        +String brand
        +int year
        +void drive()
    }
    class ElectricCar {
        +void charge()
    }
    class FlyingCar {
        +void fly()
    }
    class Electric {
        +void charge()
    }
    class Fly {
        +void fly()
    }
    Car <|-- ElectricCar
    Car <|-- FlyingCar
    ElectricCar <|.. Electric
    FlyingCar <|.. Fly
```

In this diagram, `Car` is a base class, `ElectricCar` and `FlyingCar` are subclasses that use mixins `Electric` and `Fly` respectively.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try adding new methods to existing classes using extension methods, or create your own mixins to add functionality to multiple classes. Consider how these features can be used to simplify your code and reduce redundancy.
