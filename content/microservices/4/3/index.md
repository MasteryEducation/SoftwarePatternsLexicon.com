## 4.3. Strangler Fig Pattern

The Strangler Fig Pattern is a powerful and strategic approach for incrementally migrating from monolithic systems to microservices architecture. This pattern is inspired by the strangler fig tree, which grows around an existing tree and eventually replaces it. Similarly, the Strangler Fig Pattern allows new microservices to gradually replace parts of a legacy system until the old system can be completely decommissioned. This approach minimizes risk and disruption, making it an attractive option for organizations looking to modernize their software architecture.

### Incremental Migration Strategy

The Strangler Fig Pattern is an incremental migration strategy that involves gradually replacing legacy systems with microservices. This approach allows organizations to transition to a modern architecture without the need for a complete system overhaul. By incrementally migrating functionality, teams can manage risk, reduce downtime, and ensure a smoother transition.

#### Key Concepts

- **Incremental Replacement**: Replace parts of the legacy system with microservices one at a time.
- **Parallel Operation**: Run the legacy system and new microservices in parallel during the transition.
- **Feature Parity**: Ensure new microservices replicate the functionality of the legacy system before decommissioning.

### Implementation Steps

Implementing the Strangler Fig Pattern involves several key steps, each of which plays a crucial role in the successful migration from a monolithic system to microservices. Let's explore these steps in detail:

#### 1. Routing

The first step in implementing the Strangler Fig Pattern is to establish a routing mechanism that directs requests to either the legacy system or the new microservices. This routing layer acts as a gateway, determining which part of the system should handle incoming requests based on predefined rules.

**Pseudocode Example: Routing Layer**

```pseudocode
function routeRequest(request):
    if isLegacyFeature(request):
        return legacySystem.handle(request)
    else:
        return microservice.handle(request)
```

- **Explanation**: The `routeRequest` function checks whether the requested feature is part of the legacy system or has been migrated to a microservice. It then routes the request to the appropriate handler.

#### 2. Feature Extraction

Once the routing mechanism is in place, the next step is to extract features from the legacy system and implement them as independent microservices. This involves identifying discrete functionalities within the monolith and designing microservices that replicate these functionalities.

**Pseudocode Example: Feature Extraction**

```pseudocode
function extractFeature(featureName):
    featureCode = legacySystem.getFeatureCode(featureName)
    microservice = createMicroservice(featureCode)
    deployMicroservice(microservice)
```

- **Explanation**: The `extractFeature` function retrieves the code for a specific feature from the legacy system, creates a new microservice with this code, and deploys it.

#### 3. Decommissioning

After successfully migrating and deploying microservices for all necessary features, the final step is to decommission the legacy system. This involves gradually shutting down parts of the monolith as their corresponding microservices become fully operational.

**Pseudocode Example: Decommissioning**

```pseudocode
function decommissionLegacyFeature(featureName):
    if microservice.isOperational(featureName):
        legacySystem.disableFeature(featureName)
        log("Feature " + featureName + " decommissioned.")
```

- **Explanation**: The `decommissionLegacyFeature` function checks if the microservice for a specific feature is operational. If so, it disables the feature in the legacy system and logs the decommissioning.

### Pseudocode Examples

Let's explore a comprehensive pseudocode example that demonstrates the transition from a monolithic system to microservices using the Strangler Fig Pattern.

**Pseudocode Example: Transitioning from Monolith to Microservices**

```pseudocode
// Define the routing layer
function routeRequest(request):
    if isLegacyFeature(request):
        return legacySystem.handle(request)
    else:
        return microservice.handle(request)

// Extract features from the legacy system
function extractFeature(featureName):
    featureCode = legacySystem.getFeatureCode(featureName)
    microservice = createMicroservice(featureCode)
    deployMicroservice(microservice)

// Decommission legacy features
function decommissionLegacyFeature(featureName):
    if microservice.isOperational(featureName):
        legacySystem.disableFeature(featureName)
        log("Feature " + featureName + " decommissioned.")

// Main migration process
function migrateToMicroservices(features):
    for feature in features:
        extractFeature(feature)
        routeRequest(feature)

    for feature in features:
        decommissionLegacyFeature(feature)

// Example usage
featuresToMigrate = ["UserManagement", "OrderProcessing", "Inventory"]
migrateToMicroservices(featuresToMigrate)
```

- **Explanation**: This pseudocode outlines the entire migration process using the Strangler Fig Pattern. It defines the routing layer, extracts features from the legacy system, and decommissions them once their corresponding microservices are operational.

### Visualizing the Strangler Fig Pattern

To better understand the Strangler Fig Pattern, let's visualize the process using a flowchart. This diagram illustrates the key steps involved in the migration from a monolithic system to microservices.

```mermaid

    A[Start Migration] --> B[Route Request]
    B --> C{Is Legacy Feature?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Handle by Legacy System]
    C -->|No| E[Handle by Microservice]
    E --> F[Extract Feature]
    F --> G[Deploy Microservice]
    G --> H{Is Microservice Operational?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Decommission Legacy Feature]
    I --> J[Log Decommissioning]
    J --> K[End Migration]
```

- **Description**: This flowchart represents the migration process using the Strangler Fig Pattern. It shows how requests are routed, features are extracted and deployed as microservices, and legacy features are decommissioned.

### Key Participants

The Strangler Fig Pattern involves several key participants, each playing a crucial role in the migration process:

- **Legacy System**: The existing monolithic system that is being incrementally replaced by microservices.
- **Microservices**: The new, independent services that replicate the functionality of the legacy system.
- **Routing Layer**: The gateway that directs requests to either the legacy system or the microservices.
- **Development Team**: The team responsible for extracting features, developing microservices, and managing the migration process.

### Applicability

The Strangler Fig Pattern is applicable in various scenarios, particularly when organizations need to modernize their software architecture without disrupting existing operations. It is especially useful when:

- The legacy system is large and complex, making a complete rewrite impractical.
- There is a need to minimize downtime and risk during the migration process.
- The organization wants to gradually adopt microservices while maintaining existing functionality.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Strangler Fig Pattern, consider the following design considerations:

- **Feature Identification**: Carefully identify and prioritize features for migration based on business needs and technical feasibility.
- **Parallel Operation**: Ensure the legacy system and microservices can operate in parallel without conflicts.
- **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test new microservices to ensure they replicate the functionality of the legacy system.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging to track the performance and reliability of both the legacy system and microservices.

### Differences and Similarities

The Strangler Fig Pattern is often compared to other migration strategies, such as the Big Bang approach. Here are some key differences and similarities:

- **Incremental vs. Complete Migration**: The Strangler Fig Pattern focuses on incremental migration, while the Big Bang approach involves a complete system overhaul.
- **Risk Management**: The Strangler Fig Pattern minimizes risk by allowing parallel operation, whereas the Big Bang approach carries a higher risk of disruption.
- **Complexity**: The Strangler Fig Pattern can be more complex to implement due to the need for routing and parallel operation, but it offers greater flexibility and control.
