### Visualizing Microservices Concepts

To enhance your understanding of microservices design patterns and architectural principles, it is beneficial to visualize complex concepts using diagrams and charts. Below are some examples of how to represent key microservices concepts using Hugo-compatible Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Visualizing Service Decomposition

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Monolithic Application] -->|Decompose| B[Microservice 1];
    A -->|Decompose| C[Microservice 2];
    A -->|Decompose| D[Microservice 3];
    B --> E[Database 1];
    C --> F[Database 2];
    D --> G[Database 3];
```

**Description:** This diagram illustrates the process of decomposing a monolithic application into multiple microservices, each with its own database.

#### Visualizing Inter-Service Communication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API Gateway
    participant Service1
    participant Service2

    Client->>API Gateway: Request
    API Gateway->>Service1: Forward Request
    Service1->>Service2: Call
    Service2-->>Service1: Response
    Service1-->>API Gateway: Response
    API Gateway-->>Client: Response
```

**Description:** This sequence diagram demonstrates the flow of communication between a client, an API gateway, and two microservices.

#### Visualizing Event-Driven Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Event Producer] -->|Publish Event| B[Event Broker];
    B -->|Distribute Event| C[Event Consumer 1];
    B -->|Distribute Event| D[Event Consumer 2];
```

**Description:** This diagram represents an event-driven architecture where an event producer publishes events to an event broker, which then distributes them to multiple event consumers.
