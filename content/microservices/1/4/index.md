### Decomposition Patterns

#### 1. Decompose by Business Capability

**Intent**: Align microservices with business capabilities to ensure that each service has a clear and focused responsibility.

**Key Participants**:
- Business Analysts
- Domain Experts
- Developers

**Applicability**: Use this pattern when you want to ensure that your microservices architecture closely aligns with the business structure and goals.

**Design Considerations**:
- Ensure that each service encapsulates a distinct business capability.
- Avoid creating services that are too granular, leading to increased complexity.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```pseudocode
// Define a service for each business capability
Service OrderManagement {
    Function createOrder(orderDetails) {
        // Logic to create an order
    }
    Function cancelOrder(orderId) {
        // Logic to cancel an order
    }
}

Service InventoryManagement {
    Function updateStock(productId, quantity) {
        // Logic to update stock levels
    }
    Function checkStock(productId) {
        // Logic to check stock availability
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Order Management] -->|Creates| B[Order]
    A -->|Cancels| B
    C[Inventory Management] -->|Updates| D[Stock]
    C -->|Checks| D
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: While the pseudocode is language-agnostic, consider using language features that support modularization and encapsulation, such as classes or modules.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is similar to the decomposition by subdomain pattern but focuses more on aligning with business capabilities rather than domain boundaries.

#### 2. Decompose by Subdomain (Domain-Driven Design)

**Intent**: Use domain-driven design (DDD) principles to define service boundaries based on subdomains.

**Key Participants**:
- Domain Experts
- Developers

**Applicability**: Use this pattern when you want to leverage DDD to inform your microservices architecture.

**Design Considerations**:
- Identify bounded contexts and define services around them.
- Use ubiquitous language to ensure clear communication between domain experts and developers.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```pseudocode
// Define a service for each subdomain
Service CustomerContext {
    Function addCustomer(customerDetails) {
        // Logic to add a customer
    }
    Function getCustomer(customerId) {
        // Logic to retrieve customer information
    }
}

Service BillingContext {
    Function generateInvoice(orderId) {
        // Logic to generate an invoice
    }
    Function processPayment(paymentDetails) {
        // Logic to process payment
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Customer Context] -->|Adds| B[Customer]
    A -->|Retrieves| B
    C[Billing Context] -->|Generates| D[Invoice]
    C -->|Processes| E[Payment]
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language constructs that support encapsulation and separation of concerns, such as namespaces or packages.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is similar to the decomposition by business capability pattern but focuses on domain boundaries rather than business capabilities.

#### 3. Strangler Fig Pattern

**Intent**: Incrementally migrate a monolithic application to microservices by gradually replacing parts of the monolith with new services.

**Key Participants**:
- Developers
- Architects

**Applicability**: Use this pattern when you need to migrate a legacy system to microservices without disrupting existing functionality.

**Design Considerations**:
- Identify parts of the monolith that can be easily extracted as services.
- Use feature toggles to switch between the monolith and new services.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```pseudocode
// Strangler Fig Pattern implementation
Function migrateFeature(featureName) {
    If (featureName is in monolith) {
        // Redirect to new microservice
        redirectToMicroservice(featureName)
    } else {
        // Use existing monolith feature
        useMonolithFeature(featureName)
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Monolith] -->|Feature A| B[Microservice A]
    A -->|Feature B| C[Microservice B]
    A -->|Feature C| A
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language features that support conditional logic and redirection, such as if-else statements and function calls.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is unique in its focus on incremental migration, unlike other decomposition patterns that start with a clean slate.

            forwardToServiceA(request)
        } else if (request is for Service B) {
            forwardToServiceB(request)
        }
    }
}
```

        // Logic for load balancing and routing
        routeToService(serviceRequest)
    }
    Function secureCommunication(serviceRequest) {
        // Logic for encryption and authentication
        encryptRequest(serviceRequest)
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Service A] -->|Request| B[Service Mesh]
    B -->|Route to| C[Service B]
    B -->|Route to| D[Service C]
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language features that support networking and security, such as libraries for encryption and load balancing.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```pseudocode
// Circuit Breaker implementation
CircuitBreaker {
    State state = CLOSED

    Function callService(serviceRequest) {
        If (state is CLOSED) {
            Try {
                // Attempt to call the service
                response = callService(serviceRequest)
                resetFailures()
            } Catch (Exception e) {
                recordFailure()
                If (failures exceed threshold) {
                    state = OPEN
                }
            }
        } else if (state is OPEN) {
            // Return fallback response
            returnFallbackResponse()
        } else if (state is HALF_OPEN) {
            // Attempt limited requests
            testService()
        }
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open : Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen : Timeout expires
    HalfOpen --> Closed : Successful request
    HalfOpen --> Open : Failure
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language features that support exception handling and state management, such as try-catch blocks and state machines.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is unique in its focus on failure prevention, unlike other communication patterns that focus on routing and interaction.

        // Logic to collect metrics
        gatherMetrics(service)
    }

    Function aggregateLogs(service) {
        // Logic to aggregate logs
        collectLogs(service)
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Monitoring Service] -->|Collects| B[Metrics]
    A -->|Aggregates| C[Logs]
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language features that support logging and metrics collection, such as libraries for logging and monitoring.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is similar to the distributed tracing pattern but focuses on logs and metrics rather than request traces.

#### 2. Distributed Tracing

**Intent**: Trace requests across microservices to understand system behavior.

**Key Participants**:
- Tracing Tools
- Microservices

**Applicability**: Use this pattern when you need to trace requests and understand system interactions.

**Design Considerations**:
- Implement trace contexts to propagate identifiers through calls.
- Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin for tracing.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```pseudocode
// Distributed Tracing implementation
Service TracingService {
    Function traceRequest(request) {
        // Logic to trace request
        propagateTraceContext(request)
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Tracing Service] -->|Traces| B[Request Path]
    B -->|Propagates| C[Trace Context]
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language features that support tracing and context propagation, such as libraries for distributed tracing.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is similar to the monitoring and logging pattern but focuses on request traces rather than logs and metrics.

#### 3. Health Checks and Circuit Breakers

**Intent**: Monitor service health and prevent failures from affecting the system.

**Key Participants**:
- Health Check Tools
- Microservices

**Applicability**: Use this pattern when you need to ensure service health and resilience.

**Design Considerations**:
- Implement health checks to monitor service status.
- Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```pseudocode
// Health Checks and Circuit Breakers implementation
Service HealthCheckService {
    Function checkHealth(service) {
        // Logic to check service health
        performHealthCheck(service)
    }

    Function applyCircuitBreaker(service) {
        // Logic to apply circuit breaker
        monitorFailures(service)
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Health Check Service] -->|Checks| B[Service Health]
    A -->|Applies| C[Circuit Breaker]
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language features that support health checks and failure monitoring, such as libraries for health checks and circuit breakers.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is similar to the monitoring and logging pattern but focuses on health and resilience rather than logs and metrics.

#### 4. Logging Patterns

**Intent**: Use structured logging to ensure consistent log formats and enable analysis.

**Key Participants**:
- Logging Tools
- Microservices

**Applicability**: Use this pattern when you need to ensure consistent log formats and enable analysis.

**Design Considerations**:
- Implement structured logging with consistent formats.
- Use tools like ELK stack for log aggregation and analysis.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```pseudocode
// Logging Patterns implementation
Service LoggingService {
    Function logEvent(event) {
        // Logic to log event
        formatLog(event)
        storeLog(event)
    }
}
```

**Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Logging Service] -->|Formats| B[Log Event]
    A -->|Stores| C[Log Database]
```

**Programming Language Specifics**: Use language features that support logging and formatting, such as libraries for structured logging.

**Differences and Similarities**: This pattern is similar to the monitoring and logging pattern but focuses on log formats rather than metrics and traces.
