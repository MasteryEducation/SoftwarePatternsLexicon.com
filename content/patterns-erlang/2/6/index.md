## 2.6 Modules and Functions: Scope and Organization

In Erlang, the organization of code into modules and functions is a fundamental aspect of writing clean, maintainable, and scalable applications. This section delves into the structure of Erlang modules, how functions are defined and exported, the scope rules governing variables and functions, and best practices for organizing code logically across modules. By the end of this section, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively structure your Erlang codebase.

### Understanding Erlang Modules

Erlang modules are the building blocks of an Erlang application. A module is essentially a file that contains a collection of functions, and it serves as a namespace for these functions. Modules help in organizing code logically and provide a way to encapsulate functionality.

#### Structure of an Erlang Module

An Erlang module is defined in a `.erl` file, and the module name must match the filename. The basic structure of a module includes:

1. **Module Declaration**: This is the first line in the module and uses the `-module` attribute.
2. **Export Declaration**: This specifies which functions are accessible from outside the module.
3. **Function Definitions**: These are the actual implementations of the functions.

Here is a simple example of an Erlang module:

```erlang
-module(math_operations).
-export([add/2, subtract/2]).

% Function to add two numbers
add(X, Y) ->
    X + Y.

% Function to subtract two numbers
subtract(X, Y) ->
    X - Y.
```

- **Module Declaration**: The `-module(math_operations).` line declares the module name as `math_operations`.
- **Export Declaration**: The `-export([add/2, subtract/2]).` line specifies that the `add` and `subtract` functions are accessible from outside the module. The `/2` indicates that these functions take two arguments.

### Defining and Exporting Functions

Functions in Erlang are defined using the `->` operator and are terminated with a period (`.`). Functions can be either exported or kept private within the module.

#### Exporting Functions

To make a function available outside its module, you must export it using the `-export` attribute. The export list contains tuples of function names and their arity (number of arguments).

```erlang
-export([function_name/arity, another_function/arity]).
```

#### Private Functions

Functions not listed in the export attribute are private to the module. Private functions are useful for encapsulating helper functions that should not be accessible from other modules.

### Scope Rules in Erlang

Understanding scope rules is crucial for writing effective Erlang code. Erlang has a lexical scoping mechanism, meaning the scope of variables is determined by their position in the source code.

#### Variable Scope

Variables in Erlang are immutable and have a single assignment rule. Once a variable is bound to a value, it cannot be changed. The scope of a variable is limited to the function or block in which it is defined.

```erlang
-module(scope_example).
-export([example/0]).

example() ->
    X = 10,
    Y = 20,
    Result = X + Y,
    io:format("Result: ~p~n", [Result]).
```

In the above example, `X`, `Y`, and `Result` are local to the `example` function.

#### Function Scope

Functions have module-level scope. This means that a function defined in a module can be called by other functions within the same module, regardless of its position in the file.

### Organizing Code Across Modules

Organizing code logically across modules is essential for maintainability and scalability. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module should have a clear responsibility. Group related functions together in a module.
2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for modules and functions that reflect their purpose.
3. **Modularization**: Break down large modules into smaller, more manageable ones. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. **Documentation**: Use comments and documentation to explain the purpose of modules and functions.

### Best Practices for Code Organization

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose meaningful names for modules and functions to make the code self-explanatory.
- **Keep Functions Short**: Aim for functions that do one thing well. This makes them easier to test and reuse.
- **Encapsulate Functionality**: Use private functions to encapsulate functionality that is not needed outside the module.
- **Consistent Style**: Follow a consistent coding style throughout the codebase. This includes indentation, naming conventions, and documentation.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code example by adding new functions or modifying existing ones. Try creating a new module with related functionality and see how you can organize your code effectively.

```erlang
-module(math_operations).
-export([add/2, subtract/2, multiply/2]).

% Function to add two numbers
add(X, Y) ->
    X + Y.

% Function to subtract two numbers
subtract(X, Y) ->
    X - Y.

% Function to multiply two numbers
multiply(X, Y) ->
    X * Y.
```

### Visualizing Module and Function Organization

To better understand how modules and functions are organized, let's visualize the structure using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[math_operations.erl] --> B[add/2];
    A --> C[subtract/2];
    A --> D[multiply/2];
    B --> E[Exported];
    C --> E;
    D --> E;
```

**Caption**: This diagram illustrates the `math_operations` module with its functions `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply`, all of which are exported.
