## 18.13 Integration Testing with Common Test

Integration testing is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle, especially when working with complex systems where multiple components interact. In Erlang, Common Test is a powerful framework that facilitates integration testing by allowing developers to test the interactions between different system components. This section will guide you through the process of setting up and executing integration tests using Common Test, managing test environments, and simulating real-world scenarios to ensure your system's robustness and reliability.

### Understanding Integration Testing

Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different components or modules of a system. Unlike unit testing, which tests individual components in isolation, integration testing ensures that these components work together as expected. This type of testing is essential for identifying issues that may arise from component interactions, such as data format mismatches, incorrect API usage, or unexpected side effects.

### The Role of Common Test in Integration Testing

Common Test is an Erlang-based testing framework designed for writing and executing automated tests. It is particularly well-suited for integration testing due to its ability to handle complex test scenarios, manage test dependencies, and provide detailed reports. Common Test supports various types of testing, including unit, integration, and system testing, making it a versatile tool for comprehensive test coverage.

### Setting Up Common Test Suites

To begin integration testing with Common Test, you need to set up test suites that define the scope and structure of your tests. A test suite in Common Test is a collection of test cases that are executed together. Each test case is a function that performs a specific test scenario.

#### Creating a Test Suite

1. **Define the Test Suite Module**: Create a new Erlang module for your test suite. The module should export the `all/0` function, which returns a list of test cases to be executed.

```erlang
-module(my_integration_tests).
-compile(export_all).

all() ->
    [test_case1, test_case2].

test_case1(Config) ->
    % Test logic for case 1
    ok.

test_case2(Config) ->
    % Test logic for case 2
    ok.
```

2. **Implement Test Cases**: Each test case is a function that takes a configuration parameter and returns `ok` or `{fail, Reason}`. Use assertions to validate expected outcomes.

```erlang
test_case1(_Config) ->
    Result = my_module:function_under_test(),
    ?assertEqual(expected_result, Result).
```

3. **Configure the Test Environment**: Use the `init_per_suite/1` and `end_per_suite/1` callbacks to set up and tear down the test environment for the entire suite.

```erlang
init_per_suite(Config) ->
    % Setup code
    {ok, Config}.

end_per_suite(_Config) ->
    % Teardown code
    ok.
```

### Managing Test Environments and Dependencies

Integration tests often require a specific environment setup, including databases, external services, and configuration files. Managing these dependencies is crucial for reliable test execution.

#### Handling External Dependencies

1. **Mocking and Stubbing**: Use mocking and stubbing techniques to simulate external dependencies. This approach allows you to test component interactions without relying on actual external systems.

2. **Test Databases**: Set up a dedicated test database that can be reset before each test run. This ensures that tests do not interfere with each other and that the database is in a known state.

3. **Configuration Management**: Use configuration files or environment variables to manage settings specific to the test environment. This includes database connections, API endpoints, and feature flags.

### Simulating Real-World Scenarios

To ensure that your integration tests reflect real-world usage, simulate scenarios that your system is likely to encounter in production. This includes handling edge cases, error conditions, and performance bottlenecks.

#### Example: Simulating a User Login Flow

Consider a scenario where you need to test a user login flow involving multiple components, such as a web server, authentication service, and database.

```erlang
test_user_login_flow(_Config) ->
    % Simulate user input
    UserInput = #{username => "test_user", password => "password123"},
    
    % Call the login function
    {ok, Session} = auth_service:login(UserInput),
    
    % Verify the session is created
    ?assert(Session =:= expected_session_data).
```

### Importance of Integration Tests for System Validation

Integration tests play a vital role in validating the overall system behavior. They help identify issues that may not be apparent during unit testing, such as:

- **Data Flow Errors**: Ensure that data is correctly passed between components.
- **API Contract Violations**: Verify that components adhere to expected API contracts.
- **Concurrency Issues**: Test the system's behavior under concurrent access.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identify slow interactions between components.

### Visualizing Integration Testing Workflow

To better understand the integration testing process, let's visualize the workflow using a sequence diagram. This diagram illustrates the interactions between components during a typical integration test.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Tester
    participant TestSuite
    participant ComponentA
    participant ComponentB
    participant ExternalService

    Tester->>TestSuite: Execute Test Case
    TestSuite->>ComponentA: Call Function
    ComponentA->>ComponentB: Send Data
    ComponentB->>ExternalService: Request Data
    ExternalService-->>ComponentB: Return Data
    ComponentB-->>ComponentA: Return Processed Data
    ComponentA-->>TestSuite: Return Result
    TestSuite-->>Tester: Report Success/Failure
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics, try setting up your own integration test suite using Common Test. Experiment with different scenarios and configurations to see how your system behaves under various conditions. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Modify Test Cases**: Add new test cases to cover additional scenarios.
- **Simulate Failures**: Introduce failures in external dependencies to test error handling.
- **Test Concurrency**: Simulate concurrent access to shared resources.
