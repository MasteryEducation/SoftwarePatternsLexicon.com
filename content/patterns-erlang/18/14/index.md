## 18.14 Mutation Testing with `mu2`

In the realm of software testing, ensuring the robustness and effectiveness of test suites is paramount. Mutation testing is a powerful technique that helps developers assess the quality of their tests by introducing small changes, or "mutations," to the codebase and evaluating whether the existing tests can detect these changes. In this section, we will delve into mutation testing using `mu2`, a tool specifically designed for Erlang applications. We will explore how `mu2` works, provide examples of running mutation tests, and discuss how this technique can be leveraged to identify weaknesses in test suites and ultimately improve test quality.

### Understanding Mutation Testing

Mutation testing is a method used to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite by introducing small syntactic changes to the source code and checking if the tests can detect these changes. These changes, known as "mutants," are typically simple modifications such as altering a conditional statement, changing an arithmetic operator, or modifying a constant value. The goal is to ensure that the test suite is robust enough to catch these intentional errors.

#### Key Concepts of Mutation Testing

- **Mutants**: Variants of the original code with small changes.
- **Mutation Operators**: Rules that define how mutants are created (e.g., changing `==` to `!=`).
- **Killed Mutants**: Mutants that are detected by the test suite, indicating effective tests.
- **Survived Mutants**: Mutants that are not detected, suggesting potential weaknesses in the tests.

### Introducing `mu2`

[`mu2`](https://github.com/jlouis/mu2) is a mutation testing tool for Erlang that automates the process of generating and evaluating mutants. It modifies the source code to create mutants and runs the test suite against these mutants to determine which ones are detected (killed) and which ones are not (survived).

#### Features of `mu2`

- **Automated Mutation Generation**: `mu2` automatically generates mutants based on predefined mutation operators.
- **Integration with Erlang Test Suites**: It seamlessly integrates with existing Erlang test frameworks such as EUnit and Common Test.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on the effectiveness of the test suite, highlighting areas for improvement.

### Setting Up `mu2`

To get started with `mu2`, you need to install it and set up your Erlang project for mutation testing. Follow these steps to integrate `mu2` into your development workflow:

1. **Install `mu2`**: Clone the `mu2` repository and build the tool using Erlang's build tools.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/jlouis/mu2.git
   cd mu2
   make
   ```

2. **Configure Your Project**: Ensure your Erlang project is set up with a compatible test suite (e.g., EUnit or Common Test).

3. **Run Mutation Tests**: Use `mu2` to generate mutants and run your test suite against them.
   ```shell
   ./mu2 run path/to/your/project
   ```

### Running Mutation Tests with `mu2`

Let's walk through an example of running mutation tests on a simple Erlang module using `mu2`. Consider the following Erlang module `calculator.erl`:

```erlang
-module(calculator).
-export([add/2, subtract/2]).

%% Adds two numbers
-spec add(integer(), integer()) -> integer().
add(A, B) ->
    A + B.

%% Subtracts the second number from the first
-spec subtract(integer(), integer()) -> integer().
subtract(A, B) ->
    A - B.
```

#### Writing Tests

First, we need to write tests for the `calculator` module using EUnit:

```erlang
-module(calculator_tests).
-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

add_test() ->
    ?assertEqual(5, calculator:add(2, 3)),
    ?assertEqual(0, calculator:add(0, 0)).

subtract_test() ->
    ?assertEqual(1, calculator:subtract(3, 2)),
    ?assertEqual(-1, calculator:subtract(2, 3)).
```

#### Running `mu2`

With the tests in place, we can run `mu2` to perform mutation testing:

```shell
./mu2 run path/to/calculator
```

`mu2` will generate mutants by applying mutation operators to the `calculator` module and execute the test suite to determine which mutants are killed.

### Interpreting Mutation Test Results

After running `mu2`, you will receive a report detailing the mutants that were generated and whether they were killed or survived. Here's an example of what the report might look like:

```
Mutant 1: Changed `+` to `-` in `add/2` - Killed
Mutant 2: Changed `-` to `+` in `subtract/2` - Survived
```

#### Analyzing the Results

- **Killed Mutants**: These indicate that the test suite successfully detected the introduced changes, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- **Survived Mutants**: These suggest that the test suite may have gaps, as it failed to detect the changes. In the example above, the test suite did not catch the change in the `subtract/2` function, indicating a potential area for improvement.

### Improving Test Quality with Mutation Testing

Mutation testing with `mu2` provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of your test suite. By analyzing survived mutants, you can identify specific areas where additional tests or more rigorous assertions are needed. This iterative process of refining tests based on mutation testing results leads to a more robust and comprehensive test suite.

#### Best Practices for Mutation Testing

- **Focus on Critical Code Paths**: Prioritize mutation testing for critical parts of your application where failures would have significant impact.
- **Iterate and Refine**: Use mutation testing results to iteratively improve your test suite, adding tests to cover missed cases.
- **Balance Test Coverage and Performance**: While mutation testing is powerful, it can be resource-intensive. Balance the depth of mutation testing with the performance impact on your development workflow.

### Visualizing Mutation Testing Workflow

To better understand the mutation testing process, let's visualize the workflow using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Code] -->|Generate Mutants| B[Mutants];
    B -->|Run Tests| C[Test Suite];
    C -->|Evaluate Results| D{Mutants Killed?};
    D -->|Yes| E[Effective Tests];
    D -->|No| F[Improve Tests];
    F -->|Add Tests| C;
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the mutation testing workflow, starting with the original code, generating mutants, running tests, and evaluating results to determine if mutants are killed. If not, the process iterates to improve the test suite.

### Encouragement for Using Mutation Testing

Remember, mutation testing is a journey towards achieving higher test quality. By embracing this technique, you are taking proactive steps to ensure your Erlang applications are robust and reliable. Keep experimenting with `mu2`, stay curious about the insights it provides, and enjoy the process of refining your test suites.
