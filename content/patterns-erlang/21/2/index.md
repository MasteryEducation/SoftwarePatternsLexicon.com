## 21.2 Infrastructure as Code with Erlang and External Tools

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a transformative approach to managing and provisioning computing resources through machine-readable configuration files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This paradigm shift allows for more efficient, consistent, and scalable infrastructure management, reducing the risk of human error and enabling rapid deployment and iteration.

### Understanding Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code is a practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, rather than through manual processes. This approach allows developers and operations teams to automate the setup, configuration, and management of infrastructure, making it easier to deploy applications consistently across different environments.

#### Advantages of Infrastructure as Code

1. **Consistency and Repeatability**: IaC ensures that the same configuration is applied every time, reducing discrepancies between environments.
2. **Version Control**: Infrastructure configurations can be versioned and tracked, just like application code, allowing for easy rollback and auditing.
3. **Automation**: Automating infrastructure provisioning reduces manual errors and speeds up deployment processes.
4. **Scalability**: IaC makes it easier to scale infrastructure up or down based on demand.
5. **Collaboration**: Teams can collaborate more effectively by using code to define infrastructure, enabling peer reviews and shared understanding.

### Erlang Applications and Infrastructure as Code

Erlang, known for its strengths in building concurrent and distributed systems, can greatly benefit from IaC. By using IaC, Erlang applications can be deployed in a consistent and automated manner across various environments, ensuring that the underlying infrastructure supports the application's requirements for reliability and scalability.

#### Benefits for Erlang Applications

- **Rapid Deployment**: Quickly deploy Erlang applications across multiple environments with consistent configurations.
- **Environment Parity**: Ensure that development, testing, and production environments are identical, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Easily recreate infrastructure in the event of a failure, minimizing downtime.
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently manage resources to meet the demands of Erlang's concurrent processes.

### Tools for Infrastructure as Code with Erlang

Several tools can be used to implement IaC for Erlang applications. These tools help automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, ensuring that Erlang applications run smoothly and efficiently.

#### Ansible

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the process of configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to describe automation jobs, making it accessible to both developers and operations teams.

- **Key Features**:
  - Agentless architecture, requiring no additional software on target machines.
  - Idempotent operations, ensuring that tasks are applied consistently.
  - Extensive library of modules for managing various systems and services.

**Example: Using Ansible to Deploy an Erlang Application**

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Erlang Application
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Erlang
      apt:
        name: erlang
        state: present

    - name: Deploy application code
      copy:
        src: /local/path/to/erlang_app
        dest: /var/www/erlang_app

    - name: Start Erlang application
      shell: erl -s erlang_app start
```

In this example, Ansible is used to install Erlang, deploy application code, and start the Erlang application on a group of web servers.

#### Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It uses a declarative configuration language to describe the desired state of infrastructure, allowing Terraform to manage dependencies and apply changes in the correct order.

- **Key Features**:
  - Infrastructure as Code: Define infrastructure in configuration files that describe the desired state.
  - Execution Plans: Preview changes before applying them to ensure accuracy.
  - Resource Graph: Visualize dependencies and relationships between resources.

**Example: Using Terraform to Provision Infrastructure for an Erlang Application**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "erlang_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ErlangServer"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "erlang_sg" {
  name        = "erlang_security_group"
  description = "Allow SSH and HTTP"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

This Terraform configuration provisions an AWS EC2 instance to run an Erlang application, along with a security group to allow SSH and HTTP access.

#### Chef

[Chef](https://www.chef.io/) is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. It uses a domain-specific language (DSL) written in Ruby to define infrastructure configurations, known as "recipes."

- **Key Features**:
  - Chef Server: Centralized management of infrastructure configurations.
  - Chef Client: Runs on target machines to apply configurations.
  - Chef Workstation: Tools for developing and testing Chef configurations.

**Example: Using Chef to Configure an Erlang Environment**

```ruby
package 'erlang' do
  action :install
end

directory '/var/www/erlang_app' do
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  action :create
end

cookbook_file '/var/www/erlang_app/start.sh' do
  source 'start.sh'
  mode '0755'
end

execute 'start_erlang_app' do
  command 'sh /var/www/erlang_app/start.sh'
end
```

In this Chef recipe, we install Erlang, create a directory for the application, copy a startup script, and execute the script to start the Erlang application.

### Best Practices for Infrastructure as Code

1. **Version Control**: Store IaC configurations in version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.
2. **Modularization**: Break down configurations into reusable modules to promote reusability and maintainability.
3. **Testing**: Implement automated testing for IaC configurations to catch errors early and ensure reliability.
4. **Documentation**: Document configurations and processes to facilitate onboarding and knowledge sharing.
5. **Security**: Secure sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords, using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
