## 21.6 Deployment Strategies and Tools

Deploying Erlang applications efficiently and reliably is crucial for maintaining robust systems. In this section, we will explore various deployment strategies, including blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates. We will also introduce tools such as Rebar3, Relx, and Distillery that facilitate these deployments. Additionally, we will discuss considerations for different deployment environments and emphasize the importance of versioning and consistency across deployments.

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployments

Blue-green deployment is a strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments, referred to as "blue" and "green." At any time, only one environment is live, serving all production traffic. The other environment is idle and can be used for testing new releases.

**Steps for Blue-Green Deployment:**

1. **Prepare the Green Environment**: Deploy the new version of your application to the green environment.
2. **Test the Green Environment**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the new version works as expected.
3. **Switch Traffic**: Redirect traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.
4. **Monitor**: Monitor the green environment for any issues.
5. **Rollback if Necessary**: If issues arise, switch traffic back to the blue environment.

**Advantages:**

- Minimal downtime during deployment.
- Easy rollback to the previous version.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires double the infrastructure, which can be costly.

#### Canary Releases

Canary releases involve rolling out a new version of an application to a small subset of users before deploying it to the entire user base. This strategy allows for testing in a real-world environment with minimal risk.

**Steps for Canary Releases:**

1. **Deploy to a Subset**: Deploy the new version to a small group of users.
2. **Monitor**: Monitor the performance and gather feedback.
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Gradually increase the number of users with access to the new version.
4. **Full Deployment**: Once confident, deploy to the entire user base.

**Advantages:**

- Real-world testing with minimal risk.
- Gradual exposure to potential issues.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires careful monitoring and management.

#### Rolling Updates

Rolling updates involve updating a service incrementally, one instance at a time, without downtime. This strategy is commonly used in environments with multiple instances of a service running behind a load balancer.

**Steps for Rolling Updates:**

1. **Update One Instance**: Update one instance of the application.
2. **Monitor**: Ensure the updated instance is functioning correctly.
3. **Repeat**: Continue updating instances one by one.
4. **Complete**: Once all instances are updated, the deployment is complete.

**Advantages:**

- No downtime during deployment.
- Gradual rollout reduces risk.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires careful coordination and monitoring.

### Deployment Tools for Erlang

#### Rebar3

[Rebar3](https://rebar3.org/) is a build tool for Erlang that simplifies the process of managing dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and creating releases. It is widely used in the Erlang community for its ease of use and powerful features.

**Key Features:**

- Dependency management with Hex.
- Support for plugins to extend functionality.
- Release management capabilities.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Create a new Erlang project
rebar3 new app my_app

# Compile the project
rebar3 compile

# Run tests
rebar3 eunit

# Create a release
rebar3 release
```

#### Relx

[Relx](https://github.com/erlware/relx) is a tool for building releases of Erlang applications. It integrates with Rebar3 to provide a seamless experience for creating and managing releases.

**Key Features:**

- Configuration-driven release generation.
- Support for hot code upgrades.
- Integration with Rebar3.

**Example Usage:**

```erlang
{relx, [
    {release, {my_app, "0.1.0"}, [my_app]},
    {dev_mode, true},
    {include_erts, false}
]}.
```

#### Distillery

[Distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery) is a release management tool originally designed for Elixir but can be used with Erlang applications. It provides advanced features for managing application releases.

**Key Features:**

- Support for hot code upgrades.
- Easy configuration and management of releases.
- Integration with Elixir and Erlang projects.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Initialize a new release
mix release.init

# Build the release
mix release

# Deploy the release
mix release.deploy
```

### Automating Deployments

Automating deployments is essential for maintaining consistency and reducing human error. Tools like Rebar3, Relx, and Distillery can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

**Example CI/CD Pipeline:**

1. **Build**: Use Rebar3 to compile the code and run tests.
2. **Package**: Create a release using Relx or Distillery.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the release to the target environment.
4. **Monitor**: Use monitoring tools to ensure the deployment is successful.

### Deployment Environments

When deploying Erlang applications, it's important to consider the different environments in which your application will run. Common environments include development, staging, and production.

- **Development**: Used for local development and testing. Frequent changes and deployments are common.
- **Staging**: A replica of the production environment used for final testing before deployment. It should closely mirror the production environment.
- **Production**: The live environment where the application is accessed by end-users. Stability and reliability are critical.

### Versioning and Consistency

Maintaining versioning and consistency across deployments is crucial for ensuring that your application behaves predictably. Use semantic versioning to track changes and ensure that all environments are running compatible versions of your application.

**Best Practices:**

- Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes.
- Tag releases with version numbers.
- Ensure all environments are updated consistently.

### Conclusion

Deploying Erlang applications efficiently requires a combination of robust strategies and powerful tools. By leveraging deployment strategies like blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates, you can minimize downtime and reduce risk. Tools like Rebar3, Relx, and Distillery provide the necessary features to automate and manage deployments effectively. Remember to consider the unique requirements of each deployment environment and maintain versioning and consistency across all stages of deployment.
