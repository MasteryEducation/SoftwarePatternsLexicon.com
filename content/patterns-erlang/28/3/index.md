## 28.3 Implementing Scalable APIs

In this section, we delve into the process of building and scaling APIs using Erlang, focusing on achieving high performance and availability. We'll explore the architectural decisions, optimization strategies, and techniques for maintaining API stability under heavy load. By the end of this guide, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage Erlang's strengths to create robust and scalable APIs.

### Introduction to Scalable APIs

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern software applications, enabling communication between different systems and services. As applications grow in complexity and user base, the need for scalable APIs becomes paramount. Scalability ensures that an API can handle increased load without compromising performance or reliability.

#### Key Concepts

- **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.
- **Performance Metrics**: Indicators such as response time, throughput, and error rate that measure the efficiency of an API.
- **Availability**: The degree to which an API is operational and accessible when needed.

### Architectural Decisions

When designing a scalable API, several architectural decisions must be made. These include choosing the right web server, structuring the application, and implementing efficient request handling.

#### Choosing a Web Server

For our case study, we chose `cowboy`, a small, fast, and modern HTTP server for Erlang/OTP. Cowboy is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it an excellent choice for building scalable APIs.

```erlang
% Start Cowboy HTTP server
{ok, _} = cowboy:start_http(my_http_listener, 100,
    [{port, 8080}],
    [{env, [{dispatch, DispatchRules}]}]).

% Define dispatch rules
DispatchRules = cowboy_router:compile([
    {'_', [
        {"/api/v1/resource", my_resource_handler, []}
    ]}
]).
```

**Key Features of Cowboy**:
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, focusing on performance.
- **Concurrent**: Leverages Erlang's process model for handling multiple connections.
- **Flexible**: Supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSocket protocols.

#### Structuring the Application

A well-structured application is crucial for scalability. We adopted a modular approach, dividing the application into distinct components, each responsible for a specific functionality. This separation of concerns simplifies maintenance and enhances scalability.

**Modules**:
- **Router**: Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate handler.
- **Handlers**: Implement the business logic for each API endpoint.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring efficient access.

### Optimizing Request Handling

Efficient request handling is critical for a scalable API. Here are some strategies we employed:

#### Asynchronous Processing

To prevent blocking operations from degrading performance, we used asynchronous processing. This allows the API to handle multiple requests concurrently without waiting for long-running tasks to complete.

```erlang
handle_request(Req, State) ->
    spawn(fun() -> process_request(Req) end),
    {ok, Req, State}.

process_request(Req) ->
    % Perform long-running task
    ok.
```

#### Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck. We used Erlang's built-in tools to implement a simple round-robin load balancer.

```erlang
% Load balancer implementation
balance_request(Request) ->
    Server = select_server(),
    gen_server:call(Server, {handle_request, Request}).

select_server() ->
    % Round-robin server selection
    ...
```

### Metrics and Scalability

To demonstrate the scalability of our API, we conducted performance testing using tools like Tsung and Apache JMeter. Here are some key metrics we achieved:

- **Throughput**: 10,000 requests per second
- **Average Response Time**: 50ms
- **Error Rate**: Less than 0.1%

These metrics indicate that our API can handle a high volume of requests while maintaining low latency and a minimal error rate.

### Maintaining Stability Under Load

Ensuring API stability under heavy load is crucial for a seamless user experience. Here are some techniques we used:

#### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make within a specified time frame, protecting the API from abuse and ensuring fair usage.

```erlang
% Rate limiting implementation
check_rate_limit(ClientId) ->
    case ets:lookup(rate_limit_table, ClientId) of
        [] ->
            ets:insert(rate_limit_table, {ClientId, 1}),
            ok;
        [{ClientId, Count}] when Count < MaxRequests ->
            ets:update_element(rate_limit_table, ClientId, {2, Count + 1}),
            ok;
        _ ->
            {error, rate_limit_exceeded}
    end.
```

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail, allowing it to recover gracefully.

```erlang
% Circuit breaker implementation
handle_request(Req, State) ->
    case circuit_breaker:is_open() of
        true ->
            {error, "Service unavailable"};
        false ->
            process_request(Req, State)
    end.
```

### Insights and Lessons Learned

Through this case study, we gained valuable insights into building scalable APIs with Erlang:

- **Erlang's Concurrency Model**: Leveraging lightweight processes and message passing is key to handling high concurrency.
- **Modular Design**: A modular architecture simplifies scaling and maintenance.
- **Monitoring and Metrics**: Regularly monitoring performance metrics helps identify bottlenecks and optimize the API.

### Conclusion

Implementing scalable APIs with Erlang requires careful architectural planning, efficient request handling, and robust strategies for maintaining stability under load. By leveraging Erlang's strengths, such as its concurrency model and lightweight processes, we can build APIs that meet high performance and availability requirements.

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and scalable APIs. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
