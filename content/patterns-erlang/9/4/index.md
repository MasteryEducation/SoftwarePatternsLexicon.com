## 9.4 Facade Pattern through API Modules

In this section, we delve into the Facade Pattern, a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. We will explore how this pattern can be effectively implemented in Erlang using API modules, enhancing usability and code organization.

### Understanding the Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that aims to provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. The primary goal is to hide the complexities of the subsystem and provide a cleaner, more manageable interface for the client.

#### Key Participants

- **Facade**: The main interface that clients interact with. It provides simplified methods that internally call the complex subsystem's methods.
- **Subsystem Classes**: The classes or modules that perform the actual work. They are complex and have intricate interactions, which the facade aims to simplify.
- **Clients**: The users of the facade interface. They interact with the facade instead of the subsystem directly.

### The Role of API Modules as Facades

In Erlang, API modules can serve as facades by encapsulating complex functionalities and exposing a simplified interface. This approach is particularly beneficial in functional programming, where modularity and separation of concerns are paramount.

#### Benefits of Using API Modules as Facades

1. **Simplified Interface**: By providing a single entry point to a complex subsystem, API modules reduce the learning curve for developers.
2. **Improved Code Organization**: Grouping related functionalities behind a facade leads to better-organized codebases.
3. **Decoupling**: Clients are decoupled from the subsystem, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability.
4. **Enhanced Usability**: With a clear and concise interface, API modules improve the usability of the system.

### Implementing the Facade Pattern in Erlang

Let's explore how to implement the Facade Pattern in Erlang using API modules. We'll create a simple example to demonstrate the concept.

#### Example: A Simple Banking System

Consider a banking system with various subsystems such as account management, transaction processing, and customer support. Each subsystem has its own set of complex functionalities. We will create a facade to simplify interactions with these subsystems.

**Subsystem Modules**

1. **Account Management Module**

```erlang
-module(account_management).
-export([create_account/2, close_account/1, get_account_details/1]).

create_account(CustomerId, InitialBalance) ->
    % Logic to create a new account
    {ok, AccountId}.

close_account(AccountId) ->
    % Logic to close an account
    ok.

get_account_details(AccountId) ->
    % Logic to retrieve account details
    {ok, AccountDetails}.
```

2. **Transaction Processing Module**

```erlang
-module(transaction_processing).
-export([process_transaction/3, get_transaction_history/1]).

process_transaction(AccountId, Amount, Type) ->
    % Logic to process a transaction
    {ok, TransactionId}.

get_transaction_history(AccountId) ->
    % Logic to retrieve transaction history
    {ok, TransactionHistory}.
```

3. **Customer Support Module**

```erlang
-module(customer_support).
-export([create_ticket/2, resolve_ticket/1]).

create_ticket(CustomerId, Issue) ->
    % Logic to create a support ticket
    {ok, TicketId}.

resolve_ticket(TicketId) ->
    % Logic to resolve a support ticket
    ok.
```

**Facade Module**

Now, let's create a facade module that provides a simplified interface to these subsystems.

```erlang
-module(banking_facade).
-export([open_account/2, perform_transaction/3, contact_support/2]).

open_account(CustomerId, InitialBalance) ->
    case account_management:create_account(CustomerId, InitialBalance) of
        {ok, AccountId} ->
            {ok, AccountId};
        Error ->
            Error
    end.

perform_transaction(AccountId, Amount, Type) ->
    case transaction_processing:process_transaction(AccountId, Amount, Type) of
        {ok, TransactionId} ->
            {ok, TransactionId};
        Error ->
            Error
    end.

contact_support(CustomerId, Issue) ->
    case customer_support:create_ticket(CustomerId, Issue) of
        {ok, TicketId} ->
            {ok, TicketId};
        Error ->
            Error
    end.
```

### Visualizing the Facade Pattern

To better understand the Facade Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the client, facade, and subsystems.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Facade as BankingFacade
    participant Account as AccountManagement
    participant Transaction as TransactionProcessing
    participant Support as CustomerSupport

    Client->>Facade: open_account(CustomerId, InitialBalance)
    Facade->>Account: create_account(CustomerId, InitialBalance)
    Account-->>Facade: {ok, AccountId}
    Facade-->>Client: {ok, AccountId}

    Client->>Facade: perform_transaction(AccountId, Amount, Type)
    Facade->>Transaction: process_transaction(AccountId, Amount, Type)
    Transaction-->>Facade: {ok, TransactionId}
    Facade-->>Client: {ok, TransactionId}

    Client->>Facade: contact_support(CustomerId, Issue)
    Facade->>Support: create_ticket(CustomerId, Issue)
    Support-->>Facade: {ok, TicketId}
    Facade-->>Client: {ok, TicketId}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Facade Pattern, consider the following:

- **Subsystem Complexity**: Ensure the facade simplifies the subsystem's complexity without hiding essential functionalities.
- **Interface Design**: Design the facade interface to be intuitive and aligned with client needs.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of potential performance overhead introduced by the facade layer.

### Erlang-Specific Features

Erlang's concurrency model and process-based architecture make it particularly suited for implementing the Facade Pattern. The ability to encapsulate processes within modules allows for clean separation of concerns and efficient message passing between subsystems.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

The Facade Pattern is often confused with the Adapter Pattern. While both provide a simplified interface, the Adapter Pattern focuses on converting one interface to another, whereas the Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by adding new functionalities to the subsystems and updating the facade module accordingly. Consider implementing additional features such as account balance checks or transaction reversals.
