## 9.2 Proxy Pattern Using Processes

In this section, we delve into the Proxy Pattern, a structural design pattern that uses intermediary processes to control access to other processes in Erlang. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where additional functionality, such as access control, lazy initialization, or logging, is required without altering the core logic of the target process.

### Understanding the Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern acts as an intermediary between a client and a target process, providing a surrogate or placeholder to control access to the target. This pattern is commonly used for:

- **Access Control**: Restricting or granting access to certain functionalities based on predefined rules.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Deferring the creation of an object until it is needed.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Capturing and logging interactions with the target process.
- **Remote Proxy**: Representing an object located in a different address space.

### Key Participants

- **Proxy Process**: The intermediary that controls access to the target process.
- **Target Process**: The actual process that performs the core functionality.
- **Client**: The entity that interacts with the proxy process instead of directly with the target process.

### Applicability

Use the Proxy Pattern when:

- You need to add an additional layer of control or functionality to an existing process.
- Direct access to the target process should be restricted or monitored.
- You want to implement lazy initialization for resource-intensive processes.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a simple example of a Proxy Pattern in Erlang where a proxy process controls access to a target process that performs a computation.

```erlang
-module(proxy_example).
-export([start/0, proxy/2, target/0]).

% Start the proxy process
start() ->
    ProxyPid = spawn(proxy_example, proxy, [self(), fun target/0]),
    ProxyPid ! {self(), compute, 5},
    receive
        {ProxyPid, Result} ->
            io:format("Received result: ~p~n", [Result])
    end.

% Proxy process that forwards messages to the target process
proxy(ClientPid, TargetFun) ->
    receive
        {ClientPid, compute, Value} ->
            % Perform access control or logging here
            io:format("Proxy: Forwarding request to target~n"),
            Result = TargetFun(),
            ClientPid ! {self(), Result},
            proxy(ClientPid, TargetFun)
    end.

% Target process that performs the computation
target() ->
    io:format("Target: Performing computation~n"),
    42. % Example computation result
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Proxy Process**: The `proxy/2` function acts as the proxy process. It receives messages from the client and forwards them to the target process. Here, it logs the forwarding action.
- **Target Process**: The `target/0` function represents the target process performing the actual computation.
- **Client**: The `start/0` function initiates the communication by sending a message to the proxy process.

### Benefits of Using the Proxy Pattern

- **Added Control**: The proxy process can enforce access control policies, ensuring that only authorized requests reach the target process.
- **Abstraction**: The client interacts with the proxy, unaware of the complexities involved in accessing the target process.
- **Flexibility**: The proxy can modify requests or responses, adding functionality such as caching or logging.
- **Decoupling**: The client and target process are decoupled, allowing changes to be made to the target process without affecting the client.

### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Introducing a proxy process can add overhead, potentially affecting performance. Ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.
- **Complexity**: The added layer of abstraction can increase complexity. Use the Proxy Pattern judiciously to avoid unnecessary complications.
- **Concurrency**: Consider the implications of concurrent access and ensure that the proxy process handles requests efficiently.

### Erlang Unique Features

Erlang's concurrency model, based on lightweight processes and message passing, makes it particularly well-suited for implementing the Proxy Pattern. The ability to spawn processes and communicate asynchronously allows for flexible and scalable proxy implementations.

### Differences and Similarities

The Proxy Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both add functionality to an object, the Proxy Pattern focuses on controlling access, whereas the Decorator Pattern enhances or modifies behavior.

### Visualizing the Proxy Pattern

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between the client, proxy process, and target process.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy
    participant Target

    Client->>Proxy: Request (compute)
    Proxy->>Target: Forward Request
    Target-->>Proxy: Response (Result)
    Proxy-->>Client: Forward Response
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code example by modifying the proxy process to include additional functionality, such as logging request timestamps or implementing access control based on client identity. Consider how these changes affect the overall system behavior.

The Proxy Pattern in Erlang provides a powerful mechanism for controlling access and enhancing functionality in concurrent systems. By leveraging Erlang's process model, developers can implement flexible and scalable proxies that add value without compromising the integrity of the target processes.
