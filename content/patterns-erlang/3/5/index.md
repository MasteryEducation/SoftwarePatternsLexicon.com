## 3.5 Coding Style and Conventions

In the world of software development, maintaining a consistent coding style is crucial for ensuring that code is readable, maintainable, and easy to collaborate on. This is especially true in Erlang, where the functional and concurrent nature of the language can lead to complex codebases. In this section, we'll explore the key coding style and conventions in Erlang, providing you with the guidelines you need to write clean and effective code.

### Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are the foundation of readable code. They help developers understand the purpose of variables, functions, and modules at a glance. Let's delve into the standard naming conventions in Erlang.

#### Variables

- **Use lowercase letters**: Variable names should be written in lowercase letters, with words separated by underscores. This is known as snake_case.
- **Be descriptive**: Choose names that clearly describe the purpose of the variable. Avoid single-letter names except for loop counters or very short-lived variables.

```erlang
% Good variable names
TotalSum = 0,
UserName = "Alice",

% Poor variable names
X = 0,
U = "Alice",
```

#### Functions

- **Use lowercase letters**: Function names should also be in snake_case, following the same rules as variable names.
- **Be descriptive**: Function names should clearly indicate what the function does. Use verbs to describe actions.

```erlang
% Good function names
calculate_total_sum(List) ->
    lists:sum(List).

get_user_name(UserId) ->
    % Function body here

% Poor function names
calc(List) ->
    lists:sum(List).

name(UserId) ->
    % Function body here
```

#### Modules

- **Use lowercase letters**: Module names should be in lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
- **Reflect functionality**: The module name should reflect the functionality it provides.

```erlang
% Good module name
-module(user_management).

% Poor module name
-module(um).
```

### Formatting Guidelines

Consistent formatting makes code easier to read and understand. Let's explore the key formatting guidelines in Erlang.

#### Indentation and Whitespace

- **Use spaces, not tabs**: Indent your code using spaces. The standard indentation level is four spaces.
- **Align code blocks**: Ensure that code blocks are properly aligned to enhance readability.

```erlang
% Proper indentation
-module(example).

-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    io:format("Hello, world!~n").
```

#### Line Length

- **Keep lines short**: Aim to keep lines under 80 characters. This makes code easier to read and prevents horizontal scrolling.

#### Blank Lines

- **Separate logical sections**: Use blank lines to separate logical sections of your code. This helps to visually organize the code.

```erlang
% Using blank lines to separate sections
-module(math_operations).

-export([add/2, subtract/2]).

add(A, B) ->
    A + B.

subtract(A, B) ->
    A - B.
```

### Comments and Documentation

Comments and documentation are essential for explaining the purpose and functionality of code. They help other developers (and your future self) understand the code more easily.

#### Inline Comments

- **Explain complex logic**: Use inline comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.
- **Avoid obvious comments**: Do not comment on obvious code, as it clutters the codebase.

```erlang
% Inline comment explaining complex logic
factorial(0) -> 1; % Base case: 0! is 1
factorial(N) when N > 0 -> N * factorial(N - 1). % Recursive case
```

#### Function Documentation

- **Use EDoc**: Document your functions using EDoc, Erlang's documentation tool. This provides a standardized way to generate documentation from your code.

```erlang
%% @doc Calculates the factorial of a number.
%% @spec factorial(integer()) -> integer().
factorial(0) -> 1;
factorial(N) when N > 0 -> N * factorial(N - 1).
```

### Adhering to Community Standards

Following community standards is crucial for collaboration and code sharing. The Erlang community has established a set of programming rules and conventions that you should adhere to. These can be found in the [Erlang Programming Rules and Conventions](https://www.erlang.org/doc/programming_rules/).

### Encouraging Collaboration

By adhering to coding style and conventions, you make it easier for others to understand and contribute to your code. This is especially important in open-source projects and team environments.

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding of Erlang coding style and conventions, try modifying the following code example to adhere to the guidelines discussed:

```erlang
-module(example).

-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    io:format("Hello, world!~n").
```

- Rename the module and function to reflect their purpose.
- Add inline comments to explain the code.
- Document the function using EDoc.

### Visualizing Erlang Code Structure

To better understand how Erlang code is structured, let's visualize a simple module using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Module: math_operations] --> B[Function: add/2];
    A --> C[Function: subtract/2];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram represents a simple Erlang module named `math_operations` with two functions: `add/2` and `subtract/2`.
