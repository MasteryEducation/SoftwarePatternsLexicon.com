## 3.13 Testing with EUnit and Common Test

In the world of software development, testing is a critical component that ensures the reliability, quality, and performance of applications. In Erlang, two powerful testing frameworks, EUnit and Common Test, are widely used to facilitate unit testing and integration testing, respectively. This section will guide you through the essentials of these frameworks, demonstrating how to write effective tests and encouraging the adoption of test-driven development (TDD) practices.

### The Role of Testing in Software Development

Testing is an integral part of the software development lifecycle. It helps in identifying bugs, verifying functionality, and ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements. Testing can be categorized into various types, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. In this section, we will focus on unit testing with EUnit and integration/system-level testing with Common Test.

### Writing Unit Tests with EUnit

EUnit is a lightweight unit testing framework for Erlang, designed to be easy to use and integrate into your development workflow. It allows you to write tests for individual functions or modules, ensuring that each component behaves as expected.

#### Getting Started with EUnit

To begin using EUnit, you need to include it in your project. If you're using Rebar3, you can add EUnit as a dependency in your `rebar.config` file:

```erlang
{deps, [
    {eunit, ".*", {git, "https://github.com/erlang/eunit.git", {branch, "master"}}}
]}.
```

#### Writing Your First EUnit Test

Let's start by writing a simple EUnit test for a function that adds two numbers:

```erlang
-module(math_tests).
-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

add(X, Y) -> X + Y.

add_test() ->
    ?assertEqual(5, add(2, 3)),
    ?assertEqual(0, add(-1, 1)).
```

In this example, we define a module `math_tests` with a function `add/2` and a corresponding test function `add_test/0`. The `?assertEqual` macro is used to assert that the expected result matches the actual result.

#### Test Fixtures in EUnit

Test fixtures are used to set up the environment for your tests. They can be used to initialize data or state before each test is run. EUnit provides several macros for defining fixtures:

```erlang
setup_test_() ->
    {setup,
     fun setup/0,
     fun cleanup/1,
     fun test/1}.

setup() ->
    % Setup code here
    ok.

cleanup(_State) ->
    % Cleanup code here
    ok.

test(_State) ->
    ?assertEqual(5, add(2, 3)).
```

In this example, `setup_test_` defines a test fixture that sets up and cleans up the environment for the `test/1` function.

### Introduction to Common Test

Common Test is a robust testing framework for integration and system-level testing in Erlang. It is designed to handle complex test scenarios, including distributed systems and network protocols.

#### Setting Up Common Test

To use Common Test, ensure it is included in your Erlang/OTP installation. You can create a test suite by defining a module with the `_SUITE` suffix:

```erlang
-module(my_app_SUITE).
-include_lib("common_test/include/ct.hrl").

all() -> [simple_test].

init_per_suite(Config) ->
    % Initialize suite
    Config.

end_per_suite(_Config) ->
    % Cleanup suite
    ok.

simple_test(Config) ->
    ?assertEqual(5, math:add(2, 3)).
```

#### Running Common Test Suites

You can run your Common Test suites using the `ct_run` command:

```shell
$ ct_run -suite my_app_SUITE
```

This command will execute all the test cases defined in `my_app_SUITE`.

### Test Cases and Assertions

Both EUnit and Common Test provide a variety of assertions to validate your code. Here are some common assertions:

- `?assertEqual(Expected, Actual)`: Checks if the expected value equals the actual value.
- `?assertMatch(Pattern, Value)`: Checks if the value matches the pattern.
- `?assertError(Error, Expression)`: Checks if the expression raises the specified error.

### Encouraging Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-driven development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. This practice encourages developers to think about the requirements and design before implementation, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

#### TDD Workflow

1. **Write a Test**: Start by writing a test for a new feature or functionality.
2. **Run the Test**: Execute the test, which should fail initially since the feature is not yet implemented.
3. **Implement the Code**: Write the minimum code necessary to pass the test.
4. **Refactor**: Improve the code while ensuring that all tests still pass.
5. **Repeat**: Continue this cycle for each new feature or change.

### Code Examples and Exercises

Let's explore some more complex examples and encourage experimentation:

#### Example: Testing a List Sorting Function

```erlang
-module(list_tests).
-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

sort_list(List) -> lists:sort(List).

sort_list_test() ->
    ?assertEqual([1, 2, 3], sort_list([3, 2, 1])),
    ?assertEqual([], sort_list([])).
```

#### Try It Yourself

Modify the `sort_list/1` function to handle lists with duplicate elements. Write additional tests to verify the behavior.

### Visualizing the Testing Process

To better understand the testing workflow, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Developer
    participant EUnit
    participant CommonTest

    Developer->>EUnit: Write Unit Tests
    EUnit->>Developer: Run Tests
    Developer->>CommonTest: Write Integration Tests
    CommonTest->>Developer: Run Tests
    Developer->>Developer: Refactor Code
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the developer and the testing frameworks during the development process.
