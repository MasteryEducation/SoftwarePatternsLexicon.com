## 7.6 Proper Use of Records and Maps

In Erlang, managing structured data efficiently is crucial for building robust applications. Two primary constructs for handling structured data are records and maps. Understanding when and how to use these constructs can significantly impact the performance and maintainability of your code. In this section, we will delve into the idiomatic use of records and maps, comparing their use cases, providing examples, and discussing best practices.

### Understanding Records and Maps

#### Records

Records in Erlang are a way to define fixed-structure data types. They are essentially syntactic sugar over tuples, providing a convenient way to access tuple elements by name rather than by position. This makes records particularly useful for representing data with a known, fixed structure.

**Defining a Record:**

To define a record, you use the `-record` directive. Here's an example of defining a record for a `person`:

```erlang
-record(person, {name, age, email}).
```

**Accessing Record Fields:**

Once a record is defined, you can create instances of it and access its fields using the `#` operator:

```erlang
% Creating a record instance
Person = #person{name="Alice", age=30, email="alice@example.com"}.

% Accessing fields
Name = Person#person.name,
Age = Person#person.age.
```

**Updating Record Fields:**

Updating a record involves creating a new record with the desired changes:

```erlang
% Updating the age field
UpdatedPerson = Person#person{age=31}.
```

#### Maps

Maps, introduced in Erlang 17, are a more flexible data structure that allows for dynamic key-value associations. Unlike records, maps do not require a predefined structure, making them ideal for scenarios where the data structure may change over time or is not known in advance.

**Creating a Map:**

Maps are created using the `#{}` syntax:

```erlang
% Creating a map
PersonMap = #{name => "Alice", age => 30, email => "alice@example.com"}.
```

**Accessing Map Fields:**

You can access map fields using the `=>` operator:

```erlang
% Accessing fields
Name = maps:get(name, PersonMap),
Age = maps:get(age, PersonMap).
```

**Updating Map Fields:**

Maps can be updated by creating a new map with the desired changes:

```erlang
% Updating the age field
UpdatedPersonMap = PersonMap#{age => 31}.
```

### Comparing Records and Maps

#### Use Cases

- **Records** are best suited for fixed-structure data where the fields are known at compile time. They are efficient in terms of memory and access speed due to their tuple-based implementation.
- **Maps** are ideal for dynamic data where the structure may change or is not known until runtime. They provide flexibility at the cost of slightly higher memory usage and access time compared to records.

#### Performance Considerations

- **Records** offer faster access and update times because they are implemented as tuples. However, this speed comes with the limitation of requiring a fixed structure.
- **Maps** provide more flexibility but have a slightly higher overhead due to their hash-based implementation.

### Best Practices for Choosing Between Records and Maps

1. **Use Records for Fixed Structures:**
   - When the data structure is known and unlikely to change, prefer records for their efficiency and clarity.
   - Example: Use records for configuration settings or protocol messages where the fields are predefined.

2. **Use Maps for Dynamic Data:**
   - When dealing with data that may have optional fields or varying structures, maps are the better choice.
   - Example: Use maps for JSON-like data or when interfacing with external APIs where the response structure may vary.

3. **Consider Future Changes:**
   - If you anticipate changes to the data structure, maps offer the flexibility to adapt without requiring code changes.

4. **Leverage Pattern Matching:**
   - Both records and maps support pattern matching, which can be a powerful tool for extracting and manipulating data.

### Code Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to solidify our understanding of records and maps.

**Example 1: Using Records for Fixed Data**

```erlang
-module(person_record).
-export([create_person/3, update_age/2, get_email/1]).

-record(person, {name, age, email}).

create_person(Name, Age, Email) ->
    #person{name=Name, age=Age, email=Email}.

update_age(Person, NewAge) ->
    Person#person{age=NewAge}.

get_email(Person) ->
    Person#person.email.
```

**Example 2: Using Maps for Dynamic Data**

```erlang
-module(person_map).
-export([create_person/3, update_age/2, get_email/1]).

create_person(Name, Age, Email) ->
    #{name => Name, age => Age, email => Email}.

update_age(PersonMap, NewAge) ->
    PersonMap#{age => NewAge}.

get_email(PersonMap) ->
    maps:get(email, PersonMap).
```

### Visualizing the Differences

To better understand the differences between records and maps, let's visualize their structures using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Record] --> B[Fixed Structure];
    A --> C[Tuple-Based];
    A --> D[Compile-Time Fields];
    E[Map] --> F[Dynamic Structure];
    E --> G[Hash-Based];
    E --> H[Runtime Fields];
```

**Diagram Explanation:**
- **Records** are depicted as having a fixed structure, tuple-based implementation, and compile-time fields.
- **Maps** are shown as having a dynamic structure, hash-based implementation, and runtime fields.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples:

- **Experiment with Records:** Add a new field to the `person` record and update the functions to handle it.
- **Experiment with Maps:** Add a new key-value pair to the `PersonMap` and update the functions to access it.

### Knowledge Check

- **Question:** When should you use records over maps?
- **Exercise:** Create a record and a map for a `car` entity with fields like `make`, `model`, and `year`. Update the `year` field and print the updated values.

### Embrace the Journey

Remember, mastering records and maps is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll find more complex scenarios where these constructs play a crucial role. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
