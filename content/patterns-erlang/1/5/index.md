## 1.5 Comparing Object-Oriented and Functional Design Patterns

In the world of software development, design patterns serve as reusable solutions to common problems. While object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP) both utilize design patterns, the way these patterns manifest can differ significantly due to the paradigms' inherent characteristics. In this section, we will explore these differences, focusing on how design patterns are adapted and transformed in Erlang's functional and concurrent programming environment.

### Fundamental Differences Between OOP and Functional Programming

To understand how design patterns differ between OOP and FP, we must first outline the core distinctions between these paradigms.

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Encapsulation**: OOP encapsulates data and behavior within objects. This promotes modularity and reusability.
- **Inheritance**: Allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing ones, facilitating code reuse and polymorphism.
- **Polymorphism**: Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for dynamic method invocation.
- **State Management**: Objects maintain state, which can change over time, leading to mutable data structures.

#### Functional Programming (FP)

- **Immutability**: FP emphasizes immutable data structures, reducing side effects and making code more predictable.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results, enabling powerful abstractions.
- **Statelessness**: FP encourages stateless functions, which depend only on their input parameters and produce consistent outputs.

### Reinterpreting OOP Design Patterns in Erlang

Erlang, as a functional language, reinterprets many traditional OOP design patterns to fit its paradigm. Let's explore some of these adaptations.

#### Singleton Pattern

In OOP, the Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In Erlang, this pattern is often unnecessary due to the language's process model. Instead, a process can be used to maintain a single instance of a resource.

```erlang
-module(singleton).
-export([start_link/0, get_value/0, set_value/1]).

start_link() ->
    spawn(fun loop/0).

loop() ->
    receive
        {get, Caller} ->
            Caller ! {ok, self()},
            loop();
        {set, Value} ->
            loop_with_value(Value)
    end.

loop_with_value(Value) ->
    receive
        {get, Caller} ->
            Caller ! {ok, Value},
            loop_with_value(Value);
        {set, NewValue} ->
            loop_with_value(NewValue)
    end.

get_value() ->
    singleton ! {get, self()},
    receive
        {ok, Value} -> Value
    end.

set_value(Value) ->
    singleton ! {set, Value}.
```

**Explanation**: In this example, a process is used to maintain a single instance of a value, effectively acting as a singleton.

#### Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern in OOP is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. In Erlang, this can be achieved using functions that return different types of processes or data structures based on input parameters.

```erlang
-module(factory).
-export([create/1]).

create(Type) ->
    case Type of
        type1 -> spawn(fun() -> process_type1() end);
        type2 -> spawn(fun() -> process_type2() end)
    end.

process_type1() ->
    % Implementation for type1 process
    ok.

process_type2() ->
    % Implementation for type2 process
    ok.
```

**Explanation**: The `create/1` function acts as a factory, spawning different processes based on the input type.

### Patterns Unique to Functional Programming and Erlang

Functional programming introduces patterns that are unique to its paradigm, often leveraging immutability and higher-order functions.

#### Map-Reduce Pattern

The Map-Reduce pattern is a powerful tool for processing large data sets in parallel. It is inherently functional, as it involves mapping a function over a data set and then reducing the results.

```erlang
-module(map_reduce).
-export([map/2, reduce/2]).

map(Fun, List) ->
    [Fun(X) || X <- List].

reduce(Fun, List) ->
    lists:foldl(Fun, 0, List).
```

**Explanation**: The `map/2` function applies a given function to each element of a list, while `reduce/2` aggregates the results using a folding function.

#### Pipeline Pattern

The Pipeline pattern is a functional approach to chaining operations, where the output of one function becomes the input of the next.

```erlang
-module(pipeline).
-export([pipeline/2]).

pipeline(Data, Functions) ->
    lists:foldl(fun(F, Acc) -> F(Acc) end, Data, Functions).
```

**Explanation**: The `pipeline/2` function takes an initial data value and a list of functions, applying each function in sequence to transform the data.

### Implications of These Differences on Software Design

The differences between OOP and FP design patterns have significant implications for software design, particularly in Erlang.

- **Concurrency**: Erlang's process model and message-passing capabilities make it well-suited for concurrent applications, often simplifying patterns that involve shared state or synchronization in OOP.
- **Scalability**: Functional patterns, such as Map-Reduce, naturally lend themselves to parallel execution, enhancing scalability.
- **Maintainability**: Immutability and statelessness reduce side effects, making functional code easier to reason about and maintain.
- **Flexibility**: Higher-order functions and first-class functions provide powerful abstractions, enabling flexible and reusable code.

### Visualizing the Differences

To better understand these differences, let's visualize how some common design patterns are adapted from OOP to FP in Erlang.
