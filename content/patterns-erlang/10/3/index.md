## 10.3 Command Pattern via Message Passing

In this section, we delve into the Command Pattern, a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates requests as objects, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. In Erlang, this pattern is particularly powerful due to its inherent support for message passing and concurrency. We will explore how to implement the Command Pattern using message passing, demonstrating its utility in building flexible and robust applications.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is a design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows for the decoupling of the sender and receiver of the request, enabling features such as queuing, logging, and undo operations.

#### Key Participants

1. **Command**: An interface for executing an operation.
2. **ConcreteCommand**: Implements the Command interface and defines the binding between a Receiver object and an action.
3. **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.
4. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request.
5. **Client**: Creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.

### Message Passing in Erlang

Erlang's concurrency model is based on the Actor Model, where processes communicate via message passing. This model naturally aligns with the Command Pattern, as commands can be encapsulated as messages sent between processes.

#### How Messages Represent Commands

In Erlang, messages can encapsulate both data and instructions. A message typically consists of a tuple where the first element is an atom representing the command, and the subsequent elements are the data or parameters needed to execute the command.

```erlang
% Example of a command message
{command, {operation, Data1, Data2}}
```

### Implementing the Command Pattern in Erlang

Let's explore how to implement the Command Pattern using message passing in Erlang. We'll create a simple system where commands are sent to a process that acts as the invoker and executes the commands.

#### Step 1: Define the Command Interface

In Erlang, the command interface can be represented by defining a set of message patterns that the process will handle.

```erlang
% Define command messages
-type command() :: {add, integer(), integer()} | {subtract, integer(), integer()}.
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Commands

Concrete commands are implemented as specific message patterns that the process can handle.

```erlang
% Concrete command handling
handle_command({add, A, B}) ->
    Result = A + B,
    io:format("Addition Result: ~p~n", [Result]);
handle_command({subtract, A, B}) ->
    Result = A - B,
    io:format("Subtraction Result: ~p~n", [Result]).
```

#### Step 3: Create the Invoker Process

The invoker process receives command messages and delegates them to the appropriate handler.

```erlang
% Invoker process
invoker() ->
    receive
        Command when is_tuple(Command) ->
            handle_command(Command),
            invoker()
    end.
```

### Benefits of the Command Pattern

1. **Decoupling**: The sender of a request is decoupled from the receiver, allowing for more flexible system architectures.
2. **Queuing**: Commands can be queued for later execution, enabling asynchronous processing.
3. **Logging**: Commands can be logged for auditing or debugging purposes.
4. **Undo Functionality**: Commands can be stored and reversed, providing undo capabilities.

### Example: A Simple Calculator

Let's build a simple calculator using the Command Pattern in Erlang. The calculator will support addition and subtraction operations.

```erlang
-module(calculator).
-export([start/0, add/2, subtract/2]).

% Start the calculator process
start() ->
    spawn(fun invoker/0).

% Send an add command
add(Pid, A, B) ->
    Pid ! {add, A, B}.

% Send a subtract command
subtract(Pid, A, B) ->
    Pid ! {subtract, A, B}.

% Invoker process
invoker() ->
    receive
        {add, A, B} ->
            Result = A + B,
            io:format("Addition Result: ~p~n", [Result]),
            invoker();
        {subtract, A, B} ->
            Result = A - B,
            io:format("Subtraction Result: ~p~n", [Result]),
            invoker()
    end.
```

### Try It Yourself

Encourage experimentation by modifying the code to add new operations, such as multiplication or division. Try implementing a logging mechanism that records each command executed.

### Visualizing the Command Pattern

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the flow of command messages in our calculator example.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    Client->>Invoker: {add, 5, 3}
    Invoker->>Invoker: Execute add
    Invoker->>Client: Result: 8
    Client->>Invoker: {subtract, 10, 4}
    Invoker->>Invoker: Execute subtract
    Invoker->>Client: Result: 6
```

### Design Considerations

- **Concurrency**: Ensure that the invoker process can handle multiple commands concurrently if needed.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage invalid commands or execution failures.
- **Scalability**: Consider the scalability of the system when designing the command handling architecture.

### Erlang Unique Features

Erlang's lightweight processes and message-passing capabilities make it uniquely suited for implementing the Command Pattern. The ability to spawn thousands of processes allows for highly concurrent systems where commands can be processed in parallel.

### Differences and Similarities

The Command Pattern in Erlang differs from traditional implementations in object-oriented languages due to the use of message passing instead of method calls. However, the core concept of encapsulating requests as objects remains the same.

### Knowledge Check

- **Question**: How does Erlang's message-passing model enhance the Command Pattern?
- **Exercise**: Implement a new command in the calculator example that multiplies two numbers.

### Embrace the Journey

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex systems using the Command Pattern. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
