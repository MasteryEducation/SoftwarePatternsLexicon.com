## 10.8 Interpreter Pattern using Custom Parsers

The Interpreter pattern is a powerful design pattern used to define a grammar for a language and an interpreter that uses the grammar to interpret sentences in the language. In Erlang, this pattern can be effectively implemented using custom parsers and evaluators, especially when working with domain-specific languages (DSLs).

### Intent

The intent of the Interpreter pattern is to interpret sentences in a language by defining a grammar and implementing an interpreter that processes the grammar. This pattern is particularly useful for creating command interpreters, expression evaluators, and other applications where a language needs to be parsed and executed.

### Key Participants

1. **AbstractExpression**: Declares an interface for executing an operation.
2. **TerminalExpression**: Implements an operation associated with terminal symbols in the grammar.
3. **NonTerminalExpression**: Implements an operation for non-terminal symbols in the grammar.
4. **Context**: Contains information that is global to the interpreter.
5. **Client**: Builds (or is given) an abstract syntax tree representing a particular sentence in the language defined by the grammar. The abstract syntax tree is assembled from instances of the NonTerminalExpression and TerminalExpression classes.

### Applicability

Use the Interpreter pattern when:
- You have a simple grammar and want to represent sentences in the language.
- You need to interpret expressions in a language.
- You want to create a language interpreter for a DSL.

### Erlang Unique Features

Erlang's functional nature and powerful concurrency model make it uniquely suited for implementing the Interpreter pattern. Erlang's pattern matching and recursion capabilities simplify the implementation of parsers and evaluators. Additionally, tools like `leex` and `yecc` provide powerful mechanisms for lexical analysis and parsing, respectively.

### Parsing and Evaluating DSLs

To parse and evaluate DSLs in Erlang, we can use `leex` for lexical analysis and `yecc` for parsing. These tools help in breaking down the input into tokens and then parsing these tokens according to a defined grammar.

#### Lexical Analysis with `leex`

`leex` is a lexical analyzer generator for Erlang. It takes a set of regular expressions and generates a lexer that can tokenize input strings.

```erlang
%% lexer.xrl
Definitions.
DIGIT = [0-9]
ID = [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*

Rules.
{DIGIT}+ : {token, {integer, TokenLine, list_to_integer(TokenChars)}}.
{ID} : {token, {identifier, TokenLine, TokenChars}}.
"+" : {token, {plus, TokenLine}}.
"*" : {token, {multiply, TokenLine}}.
"(" : {token, {lparen, TokenLine}}.
")" : {token, {rparen, TokenLine}}.
```

Compile the lexer with:

```shell
$ leex lexer.xrl
```

This generates a `lexer.erl` file that can be used to tokenize input strings.

#### Parsing with `yecc`

`yecc` is a parser generator for Erlang. It takes a grammar specification and generates a parser.

```erlang
%% parser.yrl
Nonterminals expr term factor.
Terminals integer plus multiply lparen rparen.
Rootsymbol expr.

expr -> expr plus term : {add, '$1', '$3'}.
expr -> term : '$1'.

term -> term multiply factor : {multiply, '$1', '$3'}.
term -> factor : '$1'.

factor -> integer : {integer, '$1'}.
factor -> lparen expr rparen : '$2'.
```

Compile the parser with:

```shell
$ yecc parser.yrl
```

This generates a `parser.erl` file that can be used to parse tokenized input.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's put it all together with a simple example of interpreting arithmetic expressions.

```erlang
-module(interpreter).
-export([interpret/1]).

interpret(String) ->
    {ok, Tokens, _} = lexer:string(String),
    {ok, ParseTree} = parser:parse(Tokens),
    evaluate(ParseTree).

evaluate({add, Left, Right}) ->
    evaluate(Left) + evaluate(Right);
evaluate({multiply, Left, Right}) ->
    evaluate(Left) * evaluate(Right);
evaluate({integer, Value}) ->
    Value.
```

### Design Considerations

- **Complexity**: The Interpreter pattern can become complex if the grammar is large. Consider using other parsing techniques or tools if the grammar is too complex.
- **Performance**: Interpreters can be slower than compiled code. Consider performance implications when using this pattern.
- **Maintainability**: Keep the grammar simple to ensure the interpreter is maintainable.

### Applications

The Interpreter pattern is widely used in applications such as:
- Command interpreters
- Expression evaluators
- Scripting engines
- Configuration file parsers

### Differences and Similarities

The Interpreter pattern is often confused with the Strategy pattern. While both involve defining a set of operations, the Interpreter pattern is specifically focused on interpreting sentences in a language, whereas the Strategy pattern is about selecting an algorithm at runtime.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples by modifying the grammar to include additional operations like subtraction or division. Try creating a DSL for a different domain, such as a simple query language or a configuration file format.

### Visualizing the Interpreter Pattern

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of the Interpreter pattern using custom parsers in Erlang.

```mermaid

    A[Input String] --> B[Lexer]
    B --> C[Tokens]
    C --> D[Parser]
    D --> E[Parse Tree]
    E --> F[Evaluator]
    F --> G[Result]
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart represents the process of interpreting an input string using the Interpreter pattern. The input string is first tokenized by the lexer, then parsed into a parse tree by the parser, and finally evaluated to produce a result.
