## 10.12 Null Object Pattern with Default Implementations

In this section, we delve into the Null Object Pattern, a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to handle null references by using default implementations. This pattern is particularly useful in Erlang, where functional programming and concurrency models can benefit from reducing error handling and null checks.

### Understanding the Null Object Pattern

The Null Object Pattern is a design pattern that uses an object with a defined neutral behavior as a substitute for a null reference. This object, known as the "Null Object," implements the same interface as the real object but performs no operation or returns a default value. The primary goal is to eliminate the need for null checks and simplify code by providing a default behavior.

#### Intent

- **Avoid Null Checks**: Reduce the need for explicit null checks in your code.
- **Simplify Error Handling**: Provide a default behavior that prevents errors from propagating.
- **Enhance Code Readability**: Make code more readable and maintainable by removing conditional logic related to null handling.

### Key Participants

- **Abstract Object**: Defines the interface or abstract class that both the real object and the null object implement.
- **Real Object**: The actual object that performs the intended operations.
- **Null Object**: A default implementation that performs no operation or returns a default value.

### Applicability

Use the Null Object Pattern when:

- You want to avoid null checks and simplify error handling.
- You have a well-defined default behavior that can be used in place of a null reference.
- You want to enhance code readability and maintainability.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore how to implement the Null Object Pattern in Erlang using a simple example. We'll create a logging system where the logger can either log messages to a file or do nothing (null object).

```erlang
-module(logger).
-export([log/1]).

% Define the interface
-behaviour(logger).

% Real Object: File Logger
-module(file_logger).
-behaviour(logger).
-export([log/1]).

log(Message) ->
    % Simulate logging to a file
    io:format("Logging to file: ~s~n", [Message]).

% Null Object: No Operation Logger
-module(null_logger).
-behaviour(logger).
-export([log/1]).

log(_Message) ->
    % Do nothing
    ok.

% Client Code
-module(client).
-export([run/0]).

run() ->
    % Use the real logger
    Logger1 = file_logger,
    Logger1:log("This is a log message."),

    % Use the null logger
    Logger2 = null_logger,
    Logger2:log("This message will not be logged.").
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use the Null Object Pattern when you have a clear default behavior that can replace null checks.
- **Avoid Overuse**: Do not overuse this pattern as it can lead to hidden errors if the null behavior is not well-defined.
- **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of using null objects, especially in high-performance systems.

### Erlang Unique Features

Erlang's functional programming paradigm and concurrency model make it well-suited for the Null Object Pattern. The use of processes and message passing allows for clean separation of concerns and simplifies the implementation of default behaviors.

### Differences and Similarities

The Null Object Pattern is similar to other patterns that provide default behavior, such as the Strategy Pattern. However, it is distinct in that it specifically targets null references and provides a neutral behavior.

### Visualizing the Null Object Pattern

To better understand the Null Object Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the real object, null object, and client code.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Logger {
        +log(Message)
    }
    class FileLogger {
        +log(Message)
    }
    class NullLogger {
        +log(Message)
    }
    class Client {
        +run()
    }

    Logger <|-- FileLogger
    Logger <|-- NullLogger
    Client --> Logger
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Logger` interface, `FileLogger` (real object), `NullLogger` (null object), and the `Client` that uses them.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code example by modifying the `log/1` function in the `null_logger` module to print a message instead of doing nothing. Observe how this changes the behavior of the client code.
