## 10.5 Template Method Pattern using Callbacks and Behaviors

In this section, we delve into the Template Method pattern, a fundamental behavioral design pattern, and explore how it is implemented in Erlang using callbacks and behaviors. This pattern is particularly useful in the context of Erlang's OTP framework, where it facilitates code reuse and standardization.

### Understanding the Template Method Pattern

The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is essential for creating a framework where the high-level algorithm is fixed, but certain operations can be customized.

#### Key Participants

- **Abstract Class**: Defines the template method and declares abstract operations that subclasses must implement.
- **Concrete Class**: Implements the abstract operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm.

### Erlang's Approach with Behaviors

In Erlang, the Template Method pattern is often realized through the use of behaviors. A behavior in Erlang is a module that defines a set of functions that must be implemented by any module that adopts the behavior. This is akin to the abstract class in object-oriented programming.

#### Behaviors and Callbacks

Behaviors in Erlang, such as `gen_server`, provide a framework for building applications. They define a set of callback functions that the developer must implement. These callbacks are the customizable parts of the algorithm, allowing developers to inject specific logic while adhering to a standard structure.

### OTP Behaviors: A Practical Example

Let's explore how the Template Method pattern is implemented using the `gen_server` behavior in OTP.

#### The `gen_server` Behavior

The `gen_server` behavior abstracts the common patterns of a server process, such as handling requests, maintaining state, and managing lifecycle events. It defines a set of callback functions that the developer must implement:

- `init/1`: Initializes the server.
- `handle_call/3`: Handles synchronous calls.
- `handle_cast/2`: Handles asynchronous messages.
- `handle_info/2`: Handles all other messages.
- `terminate/2`: Cleans up when the server is terminated.
- `code_change/3`: Handles code upgrades.

#### Implementing a `gen_server`

Let's implement a simple `gen_server` that manages a counter.

```erlang
-module(counter_server).
-behavior(gen_server).

%% API
-export([start_link/0, increment/0, get_value/0]).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).

%% API Functions
start_link() ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

increment() ->
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, increment).

get_value() ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, get_value).

%% gen_server Callbacks
init([]) ->
    {ok, 0}. % Initial state is 0

handle_call(get_value, _From, State) ->
    {reply, State, State};

handle_cast(increment, State) ->
    {noreply, State + 1};

handle_info(_Info, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    ok.

code_change(_OldVsn, State, _Extra) ->
    {ok, State}.
```

In this example, the `counter_server` module implements the `gen_server` behavior. The `init/1` function initializes the state, while `handle_call/3` and `handle_cast/2` manage synchronous and asynchronous operations, respectively.

### Advantages of Using the Template Method Pattern

1. **Code Reuse**: By defining the algorithm's structure in a behavior, we can reuse this structure across different modules, reducing duplication.
2. **Standardization**: Behaviors enforce a standard interface, ensuring consistency across modules.
3. **Flexibility**: Developers can customize specific parts of the algorithm by implementing the required callbacks.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

Below is a diagram illustrating the relationship between the `gen_server` behavior and a module implementing it.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class gen_server {
        +init/1
        +handle_call/3
        +handle_cast/2
        +handle_info/2
        +terminate/2
        +code_change/3
    }
    class counter_server {
        +start_link/0
        +increment/0
        +get_value/0
        +init/1
        +handle_call/3
        +handle_cast/2
        +handle_info/2
        +terminate/2
        +code_change/3
    }
    gen_server <|-- counter_server
```

This diagram shows how `counter_server` inherits the structure from `gen_server` and implements the necessary callbacks.

### Erlang's Unique Features

Erlang's concurrency model and lightweight processes make it particularly suited for implementing the Template Method pattern. The use of behaviors like `gen_server` allows developers to focus on the specific logic of their application while relying on OTP to handle concurrency and fault tolerance.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

The Template Method pattern is often confused with the Strategy pattern. While both involve defining a family of algorithms, the Template Method pattern fixes the algorithm's structure and allows subclasses to override specific steps, whereas the Strategy pattern allows the entire algorithm to be swapped out.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the `counter_server` example:

- Add a `decrement/0` function to decrease the counter.
- Implement a reset functionality that sets the counter back to zero.
- Experiment with different initial states in the `init/1` function.
