## 25.5 Access Control and Identity Management

In today's digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive data is paramount. Access control and identity management are critical components of any secure application, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access specific resources. In this section, we will explore how to implement these mechanisms in Erlang applications, leveraging its functional and concurrent programming paradigms.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?" Common methods include passwords, biometrics, and tokens.

**Authorization**, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?" This involves checking permissions and roles to ensure that users can only access resources they are permitted to.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system.
- **Authorization**: Determining access rights to resources.
- **Identity Management**: Managing user identities and their access rights.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a widely used model where access permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users. Users are then assigned roles, which simplifies management and enhances security.

#### Implementing RBAC in Erlang

To implement RBAC in Erlang, we can use a combination of modules and data structures to define roles and permissions. Here's a basic example:

```erlang
-module(rbac).
-export([assign_role/2, check_permission/3]).

% Define roles and permissions
-define(ROLES, #{admin => [read, write, delete], user => [read]}).

% Assign a role to a user
assign_role(User, Role) ->
    ets:insert(user_roles, {User, Role}).

% Check if a user has a specific permission
check_permission(User, Permission) ->
    case ets:lookup(user_roles, User) of
        [{_, Role}] ->
            Permissions = maps:get(Role, ?ROLES, []),
            lists:member(Permission, Permissions);
        [] ->
            false
    end.
```

In this example, we use an ETS table to store user roles and a map to define role permissions. The `check_permission/3` function verifies if a user has the necessary permission.

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** is a more flexible model that uses attributes (e.g., user, resource, environment) to determine access rights. This model allows for fine-grained access control policies.

#### Implementing ABAC in Erlang

Implementing ABAC involves defining policies based on attributes and evaluating these policies at runtime. Here's a simplified example:

```erlang
-module(abac).
-export([evaluate_policy/3]).

% Define a policy
-define(POLICY, fun(User, Resource, Action) ->
    User#user.role =:= admin orelse
    (User#user.department =:= Resource#resource.department andalso Action =:= read)
end).

% Evaluate a policy
evaluate_policy(User, Resource, Action) ->
    Policy = ?POLICY,
    Policy(User, Resource, Action).
```

In this example, we define a policy as a function that checks user and resource attributes to determine access rights.

### Best Practices for Password Management

Effective password management is crucial for securing user accounts. Here are some best practices:

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Encourage users to create complex passwords with a mix of characters.
- **Store Passwords Securely**: Use hashing algorithms like bcrypt to store passwords securely.
- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification methods.

#### Example: Password Hashing in Erlang

```erlang
-module(password).
-export([hash_password/1, verify_password/2]).

% Hash a password
hash_password(Password) ->
    bcrypt:hashpw(Password, bcrypt:gen_salt()).

% Verify a password
verify_password(Password, Hash) ->
    bcrypt:checkpw(Password, Hash).
```

In this example, we use the `bcrypt` library to hash and verify passwords, ensuring they are stored securely.

### Monitoring and Auditing Access Attempts

Monitoring and auditing access attempts are essential for detecting unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with security policies. Implement logging mechanisms to track access attempts and review logs regularly.

#### Example: Logging Access Attempts

```erlang
-module(access_logger).
-export([log_access_attempt/3]).

% Log an access attempt
log_access_attempt(User, Resource, Result) ->
    io:format("User ~p attempted to access ~p: ~p~n", [User, Resource, Result]).
```

This simple logging function records each access attempt, which can be reviewed for suspicious activity.

### Visualizing Access Control Models

To better understand the flow of access control, let's visualize the RBAC and ABAC models using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### RBAC Model

```mermaid
graph TD;
    User1 -->|Role: Admin| Role1[Admin]
    User2 -->|Role: User| Role2[User]
    Role1 -->|Permissions: Read, Write, Delete| Resource1
    Role2 -->|Permissions: Read| Resource1
```

#### ABAC Model

```mermaid
graph TD;
    User1 -->|Attributes: Role=Admin| Policy1
    User2 -->|Attributes: Department=HR| Policy1
    Policy1 -->|Action: Read| Resource1
    Policy1 -->|Action: Write| Resource2
```

These diagrams illustrate how users, roles, and policies interact in each model.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try adding new roles or policies, and test how the access control mechanisms respond. Modify the logging function to include timestamps or additional information.
