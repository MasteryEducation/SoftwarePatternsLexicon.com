## 25.7 Encryption and Key Management

In today's digital landscape, securing sensitive data is paramount. Encryption and key management are critical components of a robust security strategy. In this section, we will explore encryption methods, key management practices, and how to implement them in Erlang, ensuring compliance with standards like PCI DSS.

### Understanding Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. There are two primary types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric.

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is fast and efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. However, the challenge lies in securely sharing the key between parties.

**Example of Symmetric Encryption in Erlang:**

```erlang
-module(symmetric_example).
-export([encrypt/2, decrypt/2]).

% Encrypts data using a symmetric key
encrypt(Key, Data) ->
    crypto:block_encrypt(aes_cbc256, Key, <<0:128>>, Data).

% Decrypts data using a symmetric key
decrypt(Key, EncryptedData) ->
    crypto:block_decrypt(aes_cbc256, Key, <<0:128>>, EncryptedData).
```

In this example, we use the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with a 256-bit key in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. The `crypto` module in Erlang provides the necessary functions for encryption and decryption.

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This method is more secure for key exchange but is computationally intensive.

**Example of Asymmetric Encryption in Erlang:**

```erlang
-module(asymmetric_example).
-export([generate_keys/0, encrypt/2, decrypt/2]).

% Generates a pair of RSA keys
generate_keys() ->
    {PublicKey, PrivateKey} = crypto:generate_key(rsa, 2048),
    {PublicKey, PrivateKey}.

% Encrypts data using the public key
encrypt(PublicKey, Data) ->
    crypto:public_encrypt(rsa, Data, PublicKey).

% Decrypts data using the private key
decrypt(PrivateKey, EncryptedData) ->
    crypto:private_decrypt(rsa, EncryptedData, PrivateKey).
```

Here, we use RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption to generate a pair of keys and perform encryption and decryption.

### Key Management

Effective key management is crucial for maintaining the security of encrypted data. It involves key generation, distribution, rotation, revocation, and secure storage.

#### Key Generation

Key generation is the process of creating cryptographic keys. In Erlang, you can use the `crypto` module to generate keys for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

**Example of Key Generation:**

```erlang
-module(key_management).
-export([generate_symmetric_key/0, generate_asymmetric_keys/0]).

% Generates a symmetric key
generate_symmetric_key() ->
    crypto:strong_rand_bytes(32).

% Generates a pair of asymmetric keys
generate_asymmetric_keys() ->
    crypto:generate_key(rsa, 2048).
```

#### Key Distribution

Secure key distribution ensures that keys are shared only with authorized parties. Asymmetric encryption is often used to securely exchange symmetric keys.

**Diagram: Key Distribution Process**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Sender
    participant B as Receiver
    A->>B: Send Public Key
    B->>A: Encrypt Symmetric Key with Public Key
    A->>B: Send Encrypted Symmetric Key
    B->>B: Decrypt Symmetric Key with Private Key
```

#### Key Rotation

Regularly rotating keys minimizes the risk of key compromise. Implement automated processes to rotate keys and update systems accordingly.

#### Key Revocation

Key revocation is the process of invalidating keys that are no longer secure. Maintain a revocation list and ensure systems check this list before using a key.

#### Secure Key Storage

Store keys securely to prevent unauthorized access. Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults to protect keys.

**Example of Secure Key Storage:**

```erlang
-module(secure_storage).
-export([store_key/2, retrieve_key/1]).

% Stores a key securely
store_key(KeyId, Key) ->
    ets:new(KeyId, [named_table, public]),
    ets:insert(KeyId, {key, Key}).

% Retrieves a key securely
retrieve_key(KeyId) ->
    case ets:lookup(KeyId, key) of
        [{key, Key}] -> Key;
        [] -> undefined
    end.
```

### Compliance with Standards

Compliance with standards like PCI DSS is essential for organizations handling sensitive data. These standards provide guidelines for encryption and key management.

#### PCI DSS Key Management Requirements

- **Key Generation**: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and secure methods for key generation.
- **Key Distribution**: Ensure keys are distributed securely and only to authorized parties.
- **Key Storage**: Store keys securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate keys to minimize the risk of compromise.
