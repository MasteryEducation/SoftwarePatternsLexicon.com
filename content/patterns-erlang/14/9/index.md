## 14.9 Handling Network Errors and Retries

In the world of distributed systems and external integrations, network errors are inevitable. As Erlang developers, we must design our applications to handle these errors gracefully and ensure that our systems remain resilient. This section will guide you through common network-related issues, implementing retry logic with exponential backoff, using circuit breaker patterns, and best practices for logging and monitoring errors.

### Understanding Network Errors

Network errors can occur due to various reasons, such as:

- **Timeouts**: When a request takes too long to complete, it may time out.
- **Transient Failures**: Temporary issues that resolve themselves, such as a brief network outage.
- **Connection Refusals**: When a server is not accepting connections, possibly due to overload.
- **DNS Failures**: Issues in resolving domain names to IP addresses.

Handling these errors effectively is crucial for maintaining the reliability and availability of your application.

### Implementing Retry Logic

Retry logic is a common strategy to handle transient network errors. By retrying a failed operation, we give the system a chance to recover from temporary issues. However, retries must be implemented carefully to avoid overwhelming the system or causing further issues.

#### Basic Retry Logic

Let's start with a simple retry mechanism in Erlang:

```erlang
-module(retry_example).
-export([fetch_data/1]).

fetch_data(Url) ->
    fetch_data(Url, 3).

fetch_data(Url, 0) ->
    {error, "Max retries reached"};
fetch_data(Url, Retries) ->
    case httpc:request(get, {Url, []}, [], []) of
        {ok, Response} ->
            {ok, Response};
        {error, Reason} ->
            io:format("Request failed: ~p. Retrying...~n", [Reason]),
            fetch_data(Url, Retries - 1)
    end.
```

In this example, we attempt to fetch data from a URL up to three times. If the request fails, we log the error and retry.

#### Exponential Backoff

Exponential backoff is a strategy where the wait time between retries increases exponentially. This approach helps to reduce the load on the system and gives it time to recover.

```erlang
-module(exponential_backoff).
-export([fetch_data/1]).

fetch_data(Url) ->
    fetch_data(Url, 3, 1000).

fetch_data(Url, 0, _) ->
    {error, "Max retries reached"};
fetch_data(Url, Retries, Delay) ->
    case httpc:request(get, {Url, []}, [], []) of
        {ok, Response} ->
            {ok, Response};
        {error, Reason} ->
            io:format("Request failed: ~p. Retrying in ~p ms...~n", [Reason, Delay]),
            timer:sleep(Delay),
            fetch_data(Url, Retries - 1, Delay * 2)
    end.
```

Here, we start with a delay of 1000 milliseconds and double it with each retry. This method allows the system to handle transient failures more gracefully.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern is a design pattern used to detect failures and prevent the application from trying to perform an operation that is likely to fail. It acts as a switch that opens when failures reach a certain threshold, preventing further attempts until the system recovers.

#### Implementing a Circuit Breaker

Let's implement a simple circuit breaker in Erlang:

```erlang
-module(circuit_breaker).
-export([request/1, reset/0]).

-define(MAX_FAILURES, 5).
-define(RESET_TIMEOUT, 10000).

-record(state, {failures = 0, open = false}).

start_link() ->
    {ok, spawn(fun() -> loop(#state{}) end)}.

request(Url) ->
    case whereis(circuit_breaker) of
        undefined ->
            {error, "Circuit breaker not started"};
        Pid ->
            Pid ! {request, Url},
            receive
                {response, Response} -> Response
            end
    end.

reset() ->
    case whereis(circuit_breaker) of
        undefined ->
            {error, "Circuit breaker not started"};
        Pid ->
            Pid ! reset
    end.

loop(State) ->
    receive
        {request, Url} when State#state.open ->
            {response, {error, "Circuit is open"}};
        {request, Url} ->
            case httpc:request(get, {Url, []}, [], []) of
                {ok, Response} ->
                    loop(State#state{failures = 0});
                {error, _Reason} ->
                    NewFailures = State#state.failures + 1,
                    NewState = if
                        NewFailures >= ?MAX_FAILURES ->
                            timer:send_after(?RESET_TIMEOUT, self(), reset),
                            State#state{failures = NewFailures, open = true};
                        true ->
                            State#state{failures = NewFailures}
                    end,
                    loop(NewState)
            end;
        reset ->
            loop(State#state{failures = 0, open = false})
    end.
```

In this example, the circuit breaker opens after five consecutive failures and resets after 10 seconds. This pattern helps to prevent cascading failures by stopping requests when the system is likely to fail.

### Best Practices for Logging and Monitoring

Logging and monitoring are essential for diagnosing and resolving network errors. Here are some best practices:

- **Log All Errors**: Ensure that all network errors are logged with sufficient detail to diagnose the issue.
- **Use Structured Logging**: Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) to make logs easier to parse and analyze.
- **Monitor Key Metrics**: Monitor metrics such as request success rates, error rates, and retry counts to identify patterns and potential issues.
- **Alert on Anomalies**: Set up alerts for unusual patterns, such as a sudden spike in error rates or retries.

### Emphasizing Resilience

Resilience is the ability of a system to handle failures gracefully and recover quickly. To build resilient systems, consider the following:

- **Design for Failure**: Assume that failures will occur and design your system to handle them.
- **Use Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for network requests to avoid hanging indefinitely.
- **Implement Fallbacks**: Provide alternative solutions or degrade gracefully when a service is unavailable.
- **Test Failure Scenarios**: Regularly test how your system handles failures to ensure it behaves as expected.

### Visualizing Network Error Handling

To better understand the flow of handling network errors and retries, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant CircuitBreaker
    participant ExternalService

    Client->>CircuitBreaker: Request
    CircuitBreaker->>ExternalService: Forward Request
    ExternalService-->>CircuitBreaker: Error
    CircuitBreaker->>Client: Retry
    loop Retry with Exponential Backoff
        CircuitBreaker->>ExternalService: Retry Request
        ExternalService-->>CircuitBreaker: Error
    end
    CircuitBreaker->>Client: Circuit Open
    Note right of CircuitBreaker: Circuit opens after max failures
    CircuitBreaker->>Client: Error Response
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the client, circuit breaker, and external service, highlighting the retry logic and circuit breaker behavior.

### Try It Yourself
