## 17.9 Case Studies in Data Engineering with Erlang

In this section, we delve into real-world examples of data engineering projects that leverage Erlang's strengths in functional programming and concurrency. These case studies illustrate how Erlang can be effectively used in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and data processing tasks, highlighting its unique capabilities and the challenges encountered along the way.

### Case Study 1: Real-Time Data Processing for a Telecommunications Company

#### Problem Statement

A telecommunications company needed to process massive amounts of real-time data generated by its network infrastructure. The goal was to analyze call records, network usage, and customer data to optimize network performance and improve customer service.

#### Solution Architecture

The solution involved building a real-time data processing pipeline using Erlang. The architecture consisted of the following components:

- **Data Ingestion**: Erlang processes were used to ingest data from various network devices and customer interactions.
- **Data Transformation**: Erlang's pattern matching and functional capabilities were employed to transform raw data into meaningful insights.
- **Data Storage**: Processed data was stored in a distributed database using Erlang's Mnesia for fast access and retrieval.
- **Data Analysis**: Real-time analytics were performed using Erlang's concurrency model to handle multiple data streams simultaneously.

```erlang
-module(data_pipeline).
-export([start_pipeline/0, process_data/1]).

start_pipeline() ->
    % Start the data ingestion process
    spawn(fun() -> ingest_data() end).

ingest_data() ->
    % Simulate data ingestion from network devices
    receive
        {data, Data} ->
            process_data(Data),
            ingest_data()
    end.

process_data(Data) ->
    % Transform and analyze data
    TransformedData = transform(Data),
    store_data(TransformedData).

transform(Data) ->
    % Example transformation logic
    lists:map(fun(X) -> X * 2 end, Data).

store_data(Data) ->
    % Store data in Mnesia
    mnesia:transaction(fun() ->
        mnesia:write({data_table, Data})
    end).
```

#### Challenges and Solutions

- **Scalability**: The system needed to handle a high volume of data. Erlang's lightweight processes and message-passing model allowed for efficient scaling.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Network failures were common. Erlang's "let it crash" philosophy and supervision trees ensured that the system could recover from failures automatically.

#### Results and Lessons Learned

The implementation resulted in a 30% improvement in network performance and a significant reduction in customer complaints. The project demonstrated Erlang's suitability for real-time data processing and its ability to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.

### Case Study 2: ETL Pipeline for a Financial Services Company

#### Problem Statement

A financial services company required an ETL pipeline to process large volumes of transaction data for compliance and reporting purposes. The existing system was slow and prone to errors.

#### Solution Architecture

The ETL pipeline was re-engineered using Erlang, focusing on the following components:

- **Data Extraction**: Erlang processes were used to extract data from various sources, including databases and APIs.
- **Data Transformation**: Complex business rules were implemented using Erlang's functional programming features.
- **Data Loading**: Transformed data was loaded into a data warehouse for reporting and analysis.

```erlang
-module(etl_pipeline).
-export([run_etl/0, extract_data/0, transform_data/1, load_data/1]).

run_etl() ->
    % Run the ETL process
    Data = extract_data(),
    TransformedData = transform_data(Data),
    load_data(TransformedData).

extract_data() ->
    % Simulate data extraction
    [{transaction, 100}, {transaction, 200}].

transform_data(Data) ->
    % Apply business rules
    lists:map(fun({transaction, Amount}) -> {transaction, Amount * 1.1} end, Data).

load_data(Data) ->
    % Load data into the warehouse
    io:format("Loading data: ~p~n", [Data]).
```

#### Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data accuracy was critical. Erlang's pattern matching and error handling mechanisms helped maintain data integrity throughout the process.
- **Performance**: The system needed to process data quickly. Erlang's efficient concurrency model allowed for parallel processing of data batches.

#### Results and Lessons Learned

The new ETL pipeline reduced processing time by 50% and improved data accuracy. This case study highlighted Erlang's ability to handle complex data transformations and its robustness in ensuring data integrity.

### Case Study 3: Distributed Data Processing for a Social Media Platform

#### Problem Statement

A social media platform needed to process user-generated content and interactions in real-time to provide personalized recommendations and content moderation.

#### Solution Architecture

The solution leveraged Erlang's distributed capabilities to build a scalable data processing system:

- **Data Collection**: Erlang nodes were deployed across multiple data centers to collect user data.
- **Data Processing**: Erlang's concurrency model was used to process data in parallel, applying machine learning algorithms for recommendations.
- **Data Distribution**: Processed data was distributed across nodes for redundancy and fast access.

```erlang
-module(distributed_processing).
-export([start_node/0, process_user_data/1]).

start_node() ->
    % Start a distributed Erlang node
    net_adm:ping('other_node@hostname'),
    spawn(fun() -> collect_data() end).

collect_data() ->
    % Simulate data collection
    receive
        {user_data, Data} ->
            process_user_data(Data),
            collect_data()
    end.

process_user_data(Data) ->
    % Apply machine learning algorithms
    Recommendations = recommend(Data),
    distribute_data(Recommendations).

recommend(Data) ->
    % Example recommendation logic
    lists:map(fun(X) -> X + 1 end, Data).

distribute_data(Data) ->
    % Distribute data across nodes
    rpc:call('other_node@hostname', ?MODULE, store_data, [Data]).

store_data(Data) ->
    % Store data locally
    io:format("Storing data: ~p~n", [Data]).
```

#### Challenges and Solutions

- **Network Latency**: Ensuring low latency across distributed nodes was challenging. Erlang's efficient message-passing and distribution mechanisms minimized latency.
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across nodes was critical. Erlang's distributed database capabilities ensured data consistency and availability.

#### Results and Lessons Learned

The system provided real-time recommendations with minimal latency, enhancing user engagement. This case study demonstrated Erlang's strengths in distributed data processing and its ability to handle real-time data streams.
