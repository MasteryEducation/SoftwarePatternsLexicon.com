### Code Example: Contributing to an Open Source Project

Let's look at a simple example of how you can contribute to an open-source Erlang project. Suppose you want to add a new feature to an existing project. Here's a step-by-step guide:

```erlang
% Step 1: Fork the repository on GitHub
% Step 2: Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

% Step 3: Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b new-feature

% Step 4: Implement the feature in Erlang
-module(new_feature).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    io:format("New feature implemented!~n").

% Step 5: Test your changes
% Run the Erlang shell and test your new feature
% erl
% 1> c(new_feature).
% 2> new_feature:start().

% Step 6: Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

% Step 7: Push your changes to your forked repository
git push origin new-feature

% Step 8: Create a pull request on GitHub
% Go to the original repository and create a pull request for your changes
```

### Try It Yourself

Try modifying the code example above by adding additional functionality to the `new_feature` module. For instance, you could implement a function that takes user input and processes it in some way. Experiment with different features and see how they work in the Erlang shell.
