2. **Recognition and Appreciation**: Recognize and appreciate the efforts of contributors to motivate continued participation.

### Code Example: Submitting a Pull Request

Let's walk through a simple example of submitting a pull request to an open-source Erlang project. We'll assume you have identified a small bug in a project and want to fix it.

```erlang
% Assume we have a simple Erlang module with a bug in the add function
-module(math_utils).
-export([add/2]).

% Incorrect implementation
add(A, B) ->
    A - B.  % Bug: Should be addition, not subtraction

% Correct the bug
% Step 1: Fork the repository on GitHub
% Step 2: Clone your fork locally
% git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math_utils.git

% Step 3: Create a new branch for your fix
% git checkout -b fix-add-function

% Step 4: Make the necessary changes
add(A, B) ->
    A + B.  % Corrected to perform addition

% Step 5: Test your changes
% erl
% 1> c(math_utils).
% {ok,math_utils}
% 2> math_utils:add(2, 3).
% 5

% Step 6: Commit your changes
% git add math_utils.erl
% git commit -m "Fix add function to perform addition"

% Step 7: Push your changes to your fork
% git push origin fix-add-function

% Step 8: Open a pull request on GitHub
% Navigate to your fork on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request"
% Provide a clear description of the changes and submit the pull request
```

### Visualizing the Contribution Process
