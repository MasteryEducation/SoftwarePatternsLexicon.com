## 8.6 Dependency Injection via Parameters and Behaviors

In this section, we delve into the concept of dependency injection (DI) in Erlang, focusing on how it can be achieved through function parameters and behaviors. Dependency injection is a design pattern that helps in creating loosely coupled systems, making them easier to test, maintain, and extend.

### Understanding Dependency Injection

**Dependency Injection** is a technique where an object or function receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. This approach promotes separation of concerns and enhances modularity. The primary goals of dependency injection are:

- **Decoupling**: Reduce the tight coupling between components, allowing them to evolve independently.
- **Testability**: Facilitate unit testing by enabling the use of mock objects or stubs.
- **Flexibility**: Allow easy swapping of components or services without modifying the dependent code.

### Dependency Injection in Erlang

Erlang, being a functional language, approaches dependency injection differently compared to object-oriented languages. Instead of injecting objects, we inject functions or modules. Erlang's functional nature, along with its powerful concurrency model, provides unique ways to implement DI.

#### Passing Dependencies as Parameters

One of the simplest ways to achieve dependency injection in Erlang is by passing dependencies as parameters to functions or modules. This method allows you to inject different implementations of a dependency at runtime.

**Example:**

Let's consider a simple logging system where we want to inject different logging strategies.

```erlang
-module(logger).
-export([log/2]).

log(Message, LogFunction) ->
    LogFunction(Message).
```

In this example, `log/2` takes a `Message` and a `LogFunction`. The `LogFunction` is a higher-order function that defines how the message should be logged.

**Usage:**

```erlang
1> ConsoleLogger = fun(Message) -> io:format("Console: ~s~n", [Message]) end.
2> FileLogger = fun(Message) -> file:write_file("log.txt", Message ++ "\n", [append]) end.
3> logger:log("Hello, World!", ConsoleLogger).
Console: Hello, World!
4> logger:log("Hello, File!", FileLogger).
```

In this example, we define two logging strategies: `ConsoleLogger` and `FileLogger`. We can inject either of these into the `log/2` function, demonstrating the flexibility of passing dependencies as parameters.

#### Using Behaviors to Abstract Dependencies

Erlang's behaviors provide a way to define a common interface for different modules. By using behaviors, we can abstract dependencies and ensure that different implementations conform to the same contract.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a payment processing system with different payment gateways. We can define a behavior for the payment gateway interface.

```erlang
-module(payment_gateway).
-export([process_payment/2]).

-callback process_payment(Amount, Currency) -> ok | {error, Reason}.
```

Each payment gateway module must implement the `process_payment/2` function.

**Stripe Payment Gateway:**

```erlang
-module(stripe_gateway).
-behavior(payment_gateway).
-export([process_payment/2]).

process_payment(Amount, Currency) ->
    % Stripe-specific implementation
    io:format("Processing Stripe payment of ~p ~s~n", [Amount, Currency]),
    ok.
```

**PayPal Payment Gateway:**

```erlang
-module(paypal_gateway).
-behavior(payment_gateway).
-export([process_payment/2]).

process_payment(Amount, Currency) ->
    % PayPal-specific implementation
    io:format("Processing PayPal payment of ~p ~s~n", [Amount, Currency]),
    ok.
```

**Usage:**

```erlang
1> stripe_gateway:process_payment(100, "USD").
Processing Stripe payment of 100 USD
ok
2> paypal_gateway:process_payment(200, "EUR").
Processing PayPal payment of 200 EUR
ok
```

By using behaviors, we ensure that both `stripe_gateway` and `paypal_gateway` conform to the `payment_gateway` interface, allowing us to swap implementations easily.

### Decoupling Modules with Dependency Injection

Decoupling modules is a key benefit of dependency injection. By injecting dependencies, we can separate concerns and allow modules to focus on their primary responsibilities.

**Example:**

Consider a notification system that can send notifications via email or SMS. We can decouple the notification sending logic from the notification creation logic.

**Notification Module:**

```erlang
-module(notification).
-export([send_notification/3]).

send_notification(User, Message, SendFunction) ->
    SendFunction(User, Message).
```

**Email Sender:**

```erlang
-module(email_sender).
-export([send/2]).

send(User, Message) ->
    io:format("Sending email to ~s: ~s~n", [User, Message]).
```

**SMS Sender:**

```erlang
-module(sms_sender).
-export([send/2]).

send(User, Message) ->
    io:format("Sending SMS to ~s: ~s~n", [User, Message]).
```

**Usage:**

```erlang
1> notification:send_notification("alice@example.com", "Hello, Alice!", fun email_sender:send/2).
Sending email to alice@example.com: Hello, Alice!
2> notification:send_notification("1234567890", "Hello, Bob!", fun sms_sender:send/2).
Sending SMS to 1234567890: Hello, Bob!
```

In this example, the `notification` module is decoupled from the actual sending mechanism, allowing us to inject different sending strategies.

### Visualizing Dependency Injection in Erlang

To better understand how dependency injection works in Erlang, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Logger
    participant ConsoleLogger
    participant FileLogger

    Client->>Logger: log("Hello, World!", ConsoleLogger)
    Logger->>ConsoleLogger: execute("Hello, World!")
    ConsoleLogger-->>Logger: Console: Hello, World!

    Client->>Logger: log("Hello, File!", FileLogger)
    Logger->>FileLogger: execute("Hello, File!")
    FileLogger-->>Logger: (writes to file)
```

**Diagram Description:**

- The `Client` calls the `Logger` with a message and a logging strategy.
- The `Logger` delegates the logging task to the injected strategy (`ConsoleLogger` or `FileLogger`).
- Each strategy handles the message according to its implementation.

### Design Considerations

When implementing dependency injection in Erlang, consider the following:

- **Interface Consistency**: Ensure that all implementations conform to the expected interface, especially when using behaviors.
- **Performance**: Passing functions as parameters can introduce overhead. Evaluate the performance implications in performance-critical applications.
- **Complexity**: While DI promotes flexibility, it can also introduce complexity. Use it judiciously to avoid over-engineering.

### Erlang Unique Features

Erlang's functional nature and concurrency model offer unique advantages for dependency injection:

- **Higher-Order Functions**: Erlang's support for higher-order functions makes it easy to pass functions as dependencies.
- **Behaviors**: Erlang's behavior mechanism provides a powerful way to define and enforce interfaces, promoting consistency across implementations.
- **Concurrency**: Erlang's lightweight processes allow for concurrent execution of different strategies, enhancing performance in distributed systems.

### Differences and Similarities

Dependency injection in Erlang differs from object-oriented languages in that it focuses on injecting functions or modules rather than objects. However, the core principles of decoupling and flexibility remain the same.
