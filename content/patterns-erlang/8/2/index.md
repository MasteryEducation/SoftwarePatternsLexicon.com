## 8.2 Factory Pattern with Functions and Modules

In this section, we delve into the Factory Pattern, a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In Erlang, we leverage functions and modules to implement this pattern, enabling efficient creation and management of data structures and processes.

### Intent of the Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern's primary intent is to define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. The Factory Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the exact types and dependencies of the objects are not known until runtime.

### Key Participants

- **Factory**: The module or function responsible for creating objects.
- **Product**: The object or data structure created by the factory.
- **Client**: The code that uses the factory to create objects.

### Applicability

Use the Factory Pattern when:
- You need to manage or manipulate collections of objects that share a common interface.
- You want to provide a library of objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
- You need to decouple the creation of objects from their usage.

### Implementing the Factory Pattern in Erlang

In Erlang, the Factory Pattern can be implemented using functions and modules. Let's explore how to create factory functions that return different types of data structures and processes.

#### Creating Factory Functions

Factory functions in Erlang can be used to create and return different types of data structures. These functions encapsulate the logic required to instantiate and configure the objects.

```erlang
-module(shape_factory).
-export([create_shape/1]).

% Factory function to create different shapes
create_shape(circle) ->
    {circle, 0, 0, 5}; % Example: Circle with center (0,0) and radius 5
create_shape(square) ->
    {square, 0, 0, 10}; % Example: Square with top-left corner (0,0) and side length 10
create_shape(triangle) ->
    {triangle, {0, 0}, {5, 0}, {2.5, 5}}. % Example: Triangle with vertices at specified points
```

In this example, the `create_shape/1` function acts as a factory, returning different tuples representing shapes based on the input parameter.

#### Selecting Modules or Processes

Erlang's module system allows us to create factories that select and instantiate different modules or processes. This is particularly useful in concurrent applications where processes need to be dynamically created and managed.

```erlang
-module(process_factory).
-export([start_process/1]).

% Factory function to start different processes
start_process(worker) ->
    spawn(fun worker_process/0);
start_process(manager) ->
    spawn(fun manager_process/0).

worker_process() ->
    receive
        {work, Task} ->
            io:format("Worker processing task: ~p~n", [Task]),
            worker_process();
        stop ->
            io:format("Worker stopping.~n")
    end.

manager_process() ->
    receive
        {assign, Task} ->
            io:format("Manager assigning task: ~p~n", [Task]),
            manager_process();
        stop ->
            io:format("Manager stopping.~n")
    end.
```

Here, the `start_process/1` function acts as a factory, spawning different processes based on the input parameter. Each process has its own behavior defined in separate functions.

### Use Cases for Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is beneficial in various scenarios, such as:

- **Dynamic Object Creation**: When the type of object to be created is determined at runtime.
- **Decoupling Code**: When you want to separate the instantiation logic from the usage logic.
- **Managing Complexity**: When dealing with complex object creation logic that can be encapsulated within factory functions.

### Design Considerations

- **Simplicity**: Ensure that the factory functions remain simple and focused on object creation.
- **Flexibility**: Design factories to be easily extendable to accommodate new types of objects.
- **Performance**: Consider the overhead of dynamic object creation and optimize where necessary.

### Erlang Unique Features

Erlang's concurrency model and lightweight processes make it uniquely suited for implementing the Factory Pattern in scenarios involving process creation and management. The ability to spawn processes dynamically and manage them through factory functions is a powerful feature that Erlang offers.

### Differences and Similarities

The Factory Pattern in Erlang shares similarities with its implementation in other languages, such as Java or C++, in terms of intent and structure. However, Erlang's functional nature and concurrency model introduce unique considerations, such as using functions and modules instead of classes and objects.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples to create additional shapes or processes. Experiment with different parameters and observe how the factory functions handle these variations.

### Visualizing the Factory Pattern

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of the Factory Pattern in Erlang, showing how the factory function interacts with different modules or processes.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client] -->|Request Shape| B[Shape Factory];
    B -->|Create Circle| C[Circle];
    B -->|Create Square| D[Square];
    B -->|Create Triangle| E[Triangle];
    A -->|Request Process| F[Process Factory];
    F -->|Start Worker| G[Worker Process];
    F -->|Start Manager| H[Manager Process];
```

This diagram shows the client interacting with the factory functions to create different shapes or start different processes.
