## 6.11 Case Studies in OTP Applications

In this section, we delve into real-world examples of Erlang applications built using the Open Telecom Platform (OTP). These case studies illustrate how OTP principles are applied in practice, demonstrating the power and flexibility of Erlang in creating robust, scalable systems. By examining these examples, we aim to provide insights into the architecture, benefits, and lessons learned from these implementations.

### Case Study 1: Building a Real-Time Messaging System

**Overview**: Real-time messaging systems require high concurrency, low latency, and fault tolerance. Erlang's OTP framework is well-suited for such applications due to its lightweight processes and robust error-handling capabilities.

#### Architecture and OTP Components

- **Processes**: Each user connection is handled by a separate Erlang process, allowing for massive concurrency.
- **Supervision Trees**: Supervisors manage user processes, ensuring that failures are isolated and do not affect the entire system.
- **`gen_server`**: Used for managing stateful connections and handling incoming messages.
- **`gen_event`**: Implements the publish/subscribe mechanism for message broadcasting.

```erlang
-module(chat_server).
-behaviour(gen_server).

%% API
-export([start_link/0, send_message/2, get_messages/1]).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).

start_link() ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

send_message(User, Message) ->
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, {send_message, User, Message}).

get_messages(User) ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, {get_messages, User}).

init([]) ->
    {ok, #{}}.

handle_call({get_messages, User}, _From, State) ->
    Messages = maps:get(User, State, []),
    {reply, Messages, State};

handle_cast({send_message, User, Message}, State) ->
    NewState = maps:update_with(User, fun(Msgs) -> [Message | Msgs] end, [Message], State),
    {noreply, NewState}.

handle_info(_Info, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    ok.

code_change(_OldVsn, State, _Extra) ->
    {ok, State}.
```

#### Benefits of Using OTP

- **Scalability**: The system can handle thousands of concurrent connections due to Erlang's lightweight processes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supervision trees ensure that failures are contained and processes are restarted automatically.
- **Maintainability**: The use of OTP behaviors like `gen_server` and `gen_event` provides a structured approach to managing state and events.

#### Insights and Lessons Learned

- **Process Isolation**: Leveraging Erlang's process isolation helps in building resilient systems where individual failures do not cascade.
- **Supervision Strategies**: Choosing the right supervision strategy (e.g., one-for-one, one-for-all) is crucial for maintaining system stability.

### Case Study 2: Implementing a Scalable API Gateway

**Overview**: An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate backend services. Erlang's OTP provides the necessary tools to build a scalable and reliable gateway.

#### Architecture and OTP Components

- **`cowboy`**: A lightweight HTTP server used to handle incoming requests.
- **`gen_server`**: Manages routing logic and state.
- **Supervisors**: Oversee the lifecycle of HTTP handlers and ensure high availability.

```erlang
-module(api_gateway).
-behaviour(gen_server).

%% API
-export([start_link/0, route_request/2]).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).

start_link() ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

route_request(Path, Request) ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, {route, Path, Request}).

init([]) ->
    {ok, #{"/service1" => service1_handler, "/service2" => service2_handler}}.

handle_call({route, Path, Request}, _From, State) ->
    Handler = maps:get(Path, State, undefined),
    case Handler of
        undefined -> {reply, {error, not_found}, State};
        _ -> {reply, Handler:handle(Request), State}
    end.

handle_cast(_Msg, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

handle_info(_Info, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    ok.

code_change(_OldVsn, State, _Extra) ->
    {ok, State}.
```

#### Benefits of Using OTP

- **Concurrency**: The gateway can handle multiple requests simultaneously, thanks to Erlang's concurrent processing model.
- **Reliability**: Supervision trees ensure that any failed components are restarted, maintaining service availability.
- **Flexibility**: The routing logic can be easily extended to accommodate new services.

#### Insights and Lessons Learned

- **Dynamic Routing**: Implementing dynamic routing allows the gateway to adapt to changes in backend services without downtime.
- **Load Balancing**: Incorporating load balancing strategies can further enhance the gateway's performance and reliability.

### Case Study 3: Designing a Fault-Tolerant Financial System

**Overview**: Financial systems require high reliability and fault tolerance. Erlang's OTP provides the necessary infrastructure to build such systems with its robust error-handling and process management capabilities.

#### Architecture and OTP Components

- **`gen_server`**: Manages transactions and account states.
- **Supervisors**: Ensure that critical processes are monitored and restarted in case of failure.
- **`gen_statem`**: Implements state machines for transaction workflows.

```erlang
-module(financial_system).
-behaviour(gen_statem).

%% API
-export([start_link/0, process_transaction/2]).

%% gen_statem callbacks
-export([init/1, callback_mode/0, handle_event/4, terminate/3, code_change/4]).

start_link() ->
    gen_statem:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

process_transaction(Account, Amount) ->
    gen_statem:cast(?MODULE, {transaction, Account, Amount}).

init([]) ->
    {ok, idle, #{}}.

callback_mode() ->
    state_functions.

handle_event(cast, {transaction, Account, Amount}, idle, State) ->
    NewState = process(Account, Amount, State),
    {next_state, idle, NewState};

handle_event(_, _, StateName, State) ->
    {next_state, StateName, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _StateName, _State) ->
    ok.

code_change(_OldVsn, StateName, State, _Extra) ->
    {ok, StateName, State}.

process(Account, Amount, State) ->
    %% Transaction logic here
    State.
```

#### Benefits of Using OTP

%% API
-export([start_link/0, connect_device/1, send_data/2]).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).

start_link() ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

connect_device(DeviceId) ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, {connect, DeviceId}).

send_data(DeviceId, Data) ->
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, {send_data, DeviceId, Data}).

init([]) ->
    {ok, #{}}.

handle_call({connect, DeviceId}, _From, State) ->
    NewState = maps:put(DeviceId, [], State),
    {reply, ok, NewState};

handle_cast({send_data, DeviceId, Data}, State) ->
    NewState = maps:update_with(DeviceId, fun(DataList) -> [Data | DataList] end, [Data], State),
    {noreply, NewState}.

handle_info(_Info, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    ok.
