## 6.4 Implementing Servers with `gen_server`

In this section, we delve into the `gen_server` behavior, a cornerstone of Erlang's OTP framework. The `gen_server` module abstracts the complexities of process management, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of their applications. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped to implement robust, stateful servers using `gen_server`.

### Understanding `gen_server` Behavior

The `gen_server` behavior is a generic server implementation that simplifies the creation of concurrent processes. It handles the boilerplate code for message passing, state management, and error handling, allowing developers to concentrate on the specific logic of their applications.

#### Key Concepts

- **Behavior**: In Erlang, a behavior is a design pattern that defines a set of callback functions. The `gen_server` behavior provides a framework for implementing server processes.
- **Callback Functions**: These are user-defined functions that handle specific events, such as incoming messages or state changes.

### Creating a `gen_server` Module

Let's walk through the process of creating a `gen_server` module. We'll start by defining the module and implementing the necessary callback functions.

#### Step 1: Define the Module

Create a new Erlang module and include the `gen_server` behavior.

```erlang
-module(my_server).
-behaviour(gen_server).

%% API
-export([start_link/0, stop/0, call/1, cast/1]).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).
```

#### Step 2: Implement the `init/1` Callback

The `init/1` function initializes the server's state. It is called when the server starts.

```erlang
init([]) ->
    %% Initialize state
    {ok, #{}}.
```

#### Step 3: Handle Synchronous Messages with `handle_call/3`

The `handle_call/3` function processes synchronous requests. It receives a request, the caller's PID, and the current state.

```erlang
handle_call({get, Key}, _From, State) ->
    %% Retrieve value from state
    Value = maps:get(Key, State, undefined),
    {reply, Value, State};

handle_call({set, Key, Value}, _From, State) ->
    %% Update state
    NewState = maps:put(Key, Value, State),
    {reply, ok, NewState}.
```

#### Step 4: Handle Asynchronous Messages with `handle_cast/2`

The `handle_cast/2` function processes asynchronous requests. It receives a request and the current state.

```erlang
handle_cast({delete, Key}, State) ->
    %% Remove key from state
    NewState = maps:remove(Key, State),
    {noreply, NewState}.
```

#### Step 5: Handle Other Messages with `handle_info/2`

The `handle_info/2` function processes all other messages that are not handled by `handle_call/3` or `handle_cast/2`.

```erlang
handle_info(_Info, State) ->
    %% Ignore unexpected messages
    {noreply, State}.
```

#### Step 6: Implement the `terminate/2` Callback

The `terminate/2` function is called when the server is about to shut down.

```erlang
terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    %% Perform cleanup
    ok.
```

#### Step 7: Implement the `code_change/3` Callback

The `code_change/3` function handles code upgrades.

```erlang
code_change(_OldVsn, State, _Extra) ->
    {ok, State}.
```

### Starting and Stopping the Server

To start the server, we use the `start_link/0` function. To stop it, we use the `stop/0` function.

```erlang
start_link() ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

stop() ->
    gen_server:stop(?MODULE).
```

### Interacting with the Server

We can interact with the server using the `call/1` and `cast/1` functions.

```erlang
call(Request) ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, Request).

cast(Request) ->
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, Request).
```

### Managing State within a `gen_server`

Managing state is a critical aspect of implementing a `gen_server`. The state is typically represented as a map or a record, and it is passed to each callback function. The state can be modified in response to incoming messages, and the updated state is returned to the `gen_server` framework.

### Common Use Cases and Best Practices

#### Use Cases

- **Stateful Services**: `gen_server` is ideal for services that need to maintain state across requests, such as a cache or a session manager.
- **Resource Management**: It can manage resources like database connections or file handles.
- **Background Processing**: `gen_server` can be used for tasks that run in the background, such as data processing or monitoring.

#### Best Practices

- **Keep State Simple**: Use simple data structures for the state to make it easy to understand and modify.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Use the `terminate/2` callback to clean up resources in case of errors.
- **Avoid Blocking Calls**: Ensure that `handle_call/3` and `handle_cast/2` do not perform blocking operations, as this can degrade performance.

### Example: A Simple Key-Value Store

Let's implement a simple key-value store using `gen_server`.

```erlang
-module(kv_store).
-behaviour(gen_server).

%% API
-export([start_link/0, stop/0, get/1, set/2, delete/1]).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).

%% API Functions
start_link() ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

stop() ->
    gen_server:stop(?MODULE).

get(Key) ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, {get, Key}).

set(Key, Value) ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, {set, Key, Value}).

delete(Key) ->
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, {delete, Key}).

%% gen_server Callbacks
init([]) ->
    {ok, #{}}.

handle_call({get, Key}, _From, State) ->
    Value = maps:get(Key, State, undefined),
    {reply, Value, State};

handle_call({set, Key, Value}, _From, State) ->
    NewState = maps:put(Key, Value, State),
    {reply, ok, NewState}.

handle_cast({delete, Key}, State) ->
    NewState = maps:remove(Key, State),
    {noreply, NewState}.

handle_info(_Info, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    ok.

code_change(_OldVsn, State, _Extra) ->
    {ok, State}.
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the key-value store by adding new operations or modifying existing ones. For example, try implementing a `clear/0` function that removes all keys from the store.

### Visualizing `gen_server` Workflow

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the interaction between a client and a `gen_server`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant gen_server
    Client->>gen_server: call({set, Key, Value})
    gen_server-->>Client: reply(ok)
    Client->>gen_server: call({get, Key})
    gen_server-->>Client: reply(Value)
    Client->>gen_server: cast({delete, Key})
    gen_server-->>Client: noreply
```
