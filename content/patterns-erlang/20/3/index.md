## 20.3 Authentication and Authorization Strategies

In the realm of software security, authentication and authorization are critical components that ensure the integrity and confidentiality of applications. In this section, we delve into various strategies for implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in Erlang applications. We will explore different authentication methods, discuss authorization models like role-based access control (RBAC), and provide practical examples of implementing these strategies in Erlang. Additionally, we will emphasize the importance of securely handling credentials and encourage regular updates to authentication protocols to address emerging threats.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Before diving into specific strategies, let's clarify the distinction between authentication and authorization:

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?"
- **Authorization** determines what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

### Authentication Methods

#### Password-Based Authentication

Password-based authentication is one of the most common methods used to verify a user's identity. While simple to implement, it requires careful handling to ensure security.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Hashing Passwords:** Always hash passwords using a strong algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 before storing them in a database.
- **Salting:** Add a unique salt to each password before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.
- **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity, and expiration.

**Erlang Example:**

```erlang
-module(auth).
-export([hash_password/1, verify_password/2]).

hash_password(Password) ->
    Salt = crypto:strong_rand_bytes(16),
    Hashed = crypto:hash(sha256, <<Salt/binary, Password/binary>>),
    {Salt, Hashed}.

verify_password(Password, {Salt, Hashed}) ->
    crypto:hash(sha256, <<Salt/binary, Password/binary>>) =:= Hashed.
```

In this example, we use the `crypto` module to hash passwords with a salt. The `hash_password/1` function generates a salt and hashes the password, while `verify_password/2` checks if a given password matches the stored hash.

#### Token-Based Authentication

Token-based authentication is widely used in modern applications, especially for stateless communication between clients and servers. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular choice for this method.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Token Expiry:** Set an expiration time for tokens to limit their validity period.
- **Secure Storage:** Store tokens securely on the client side, such as in HTTP-only cookies or secure storage.
- **Revocation:** Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens if needed.

**Erlang Example:**

```erlang
-module(token_auth).
-export([generate_token/1, verify_token/1]).

generate_token(UserId) ->
    Header = base64:encode(<<"{\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"typ\":\"JWT\"}">>),
    Payload = base64:encode(<<"{\"sub\":\"", UserId/binary, "\"}">>),
    Signature = crypto:mac(hmac, sha256, <<"secret_key">>, <<Header/binary, ".", Payload/binary>>),
    <<Header/binary, ".", Payload/binary, ".", base64:encode(Signature)/binary>>.

verify_token(Token) ->
    [Header, Payload, Signature] = string:split(Token, ".", all),
    ExpectedSignature = crypto:mac(hmac, sha256, <<"secret_key">>, <<Header/binary, ".", Payload/binary>>),
    base64:decode(Signature) =:= ExpectedSignature.
```

This example demonstrates generating and verifying JWTs using Erlang's `crypto` module. The `generate_token/1` function creates a token with a header, payload, and signature, while `verify_token/1` checks the token's validity.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification. Common factors include something the user knows (password), something the user has (a mobile device), and something the user is (biometric data).

**Key Considerations:**

- **User Experience:** Ensure the MFA process is user-friendly and does not create unnecessary friction.
- **Fallback Options:** Provide alternative methods for users who cannot access their primary MFA device.
- **Regular Updates:** Continuously update MFA methods to address new security threats.

**Erlang Example:**

Implementing MFA in Erlang typically involves integrating with external services that provide MFA capabilities, such as sending SMS codes or using authenticator apps. Here's a conceptual example:

```erlang
-module(mfa).
-export([send_mfa_code/1, verify_mfa_code/2]).

send_mfa_code(UserId) ->
    Code = random:uniform(999999),
    %% Send code to user's registered device (e.g., via SMS or email)
    io:format("Sending MFA code ~p to user ~p~n", [Code, UserId]),
    Code.

verify_mfa_code(UserId, Code) ->
    %% Verify the code entered by the user
    io:format("Verifying MFA code ~p for user ~p~n", [Code, UserId]),
    true. %% Replace with actual verification logic
```

In this example, `send_mfa_code/1` generates a random code and simulates sending it to the user, while `verify_mfa_code/2` checks if the entered code is correct.

### Authorization Models

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used authorization model that assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization. This model simplifies permission management by grouping users with similar access needs.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Role Hierarchies:** Define role hierarchies to inherit permissions from parent roles.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Assign the minimum necessary permissions to each role.
- **Dynamic Role Assignment:** Allow roles to be assigned and revoked dynamically based on user actions or changes in responsibilities.

**Erlang Example:**

```erlang
-module(rbac).
-export([assign_role/2, check_permission/3]).

-define(ROLES, #{admin => [read, write, delete], user => [read]}).

assign_role(UserId, Role) ->
    %% Assign role to user (store in database or in-memory data structure)
    io:format("Assigning role ~p to user ~p~n", [Role, UserId]).

check_permission(UserId, Action, Role) ->
    Permissions = maps:get(Role, ?ROLES, []),
    lists:member(Action, Permissions).
```

In this example, we define roles and their associated permissions using a map. The `assign_role/2` function assigns a role to a user, and `check_permission/3` verifies if a user has the necessary permission to perform an action.

### Secure Handling of Credentials

Securely handling credentials is paramount to preventing unauthorized access and data breaches. Here are some best practices:

- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, both in transit and at rest.
- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive configuration data, such as API keys and database credentials, in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in source code.
- **Access Controls:** Restrict access to sensitive data and systems based on the principle of least privilege.

### Regular Updates to Authentication Protocols

The security landscape is constantly evolving, with new threats emerging regularly. To stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities, it's crucial to:

- **Monitor Security Bulletins:** Stay informed about the latest security advisories and patches for the libraries and frameworks you use.
- **Conduct Security Audits:** Regularly audit your authentication and authorization mechanisms to identify and address potential weaknesses.
- **Update Dependencies:** Keep your dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches and improvements.

### Visualizing Authentication and Authorization

To better understand the flow of authentication and authorization processes, let's visualize them using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant AuthService

    User->>Client: Enter credentials
    Client->>Server: Send credentials
    Server->>AuthService: Verify credentials
    AuthService-->>Server: Return token
    Server-->>Client: Return token
    Client->>User: Access granted

    User->>Client: Request resource
    Client->>Server: Send token
    Server->>AuthService: Verify token
    AuthService-->>Server: Token valid
    Server-->>Client: Access resource
    Client->>User: Display resource
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between a user, client, server, and authentication service during the authentication and authorization process.
