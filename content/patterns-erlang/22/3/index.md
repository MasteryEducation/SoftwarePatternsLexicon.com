## 22.3 Release Handling with Relx and Rebar3 Releases

In the world of Erlang, managing application releases is a crucial aspect of deployment and operations. Releases encapsulate your application, its dependencies, and the Erlang runtime into a single package, making it easier to deploy and manage in production environments. In this section, we will delve into the process of creating and managing releases using Relx and Rebar3, two powerful tools in the Erlang ecosystem.

### Understanding Erlang Releases

**Releases** in Erlang are self-contained packages that include your application code, dependencies, and the Erlang runtime system. They are designed to simplify the deployment process by providing a consistent and repeatable way to deploy applications across different environments. Releases are particularly important in production settings where stability and reliability are paramount.

#### Importance of Releases

- **Consistency**: Releases ensure that the same version of your application is deployed across different environments, reducing the risk of discrepancies.
- **Isolation**: By packaging the Erlang runtime with your application, releases minimize dependencies on the host system.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Releases simplify the deployment process by providing a single package that can be easily distributed and installed.
- **Version Control**: Releases allow you to manage different versions of your application, making it easier to roll back to a previous version if necessary.

### Introducing Relx and Rebar3

[Relx](https://github.com/erlware/relx) is a release assembler for Erlang applications. It simplifies the process of creating releases by automating many of the tasks involved in packaging your application and its dependencies. Relx integrates seamlessly with Rebar3, a popular build tool for Erlang, to provide a comprehensive solution for building and managing releases.

#### Relx

Relx is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to customize the release process to suit your needs. It supports a wide range of configuration options, enabling you to specify which applications and dependencies should be included in the release, as well as how the release should be structured.

#### Rebar3

Rebar3 is a build tool for Erlang that provides a wide range of features, including dependency management, project scaffolding, and release handling. It integrates with Relx to provide a seamless experience for building and managing releases.

### Creating a Release with Relx and Rebar3

Let's walk through the process of creating a release using Relx and Rebar3. We'll start by setting up a simple Erlang application and then use Relx and Rebar3 to create a release.

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Erlang Application

First, let's create a new Erlang application using Rebar3. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
rebar3 new app my_app
```

This command will create a new directory called `my_app` with the basic structure of an Erlang application. Navigate into the `my_app` directory:

```shell
cd my_app
```

#### Step 2: Configuring Your Application

Next, open the `rebar.config` file in your favorite text editor. This file is where you'll configure your application's dependencies and release settings. Add the following configuration to the `rebar.config` file:

```erlang
{erl_opts, [debug_info]}.
{deps, []}.

{relx, [
    {release, {my_app, "0.1.0"},
     [my_app,
      sasl]},  % Include the SASL application for logging
    {dev_mode, true},  % Enable development mode for faster iteration
    {include_erts, false},  % Exclude the Erlang runtime for development
    {extended_start_script, true}  % Generate an extended start script
]}.
```

#### Step 3: Building the Release

With your application configured, you can now build the release using Rebar3. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
rebar3 release
```

This command will compile your application and create a release in the `_build/default/rel/my_app` directory. The release will include your application, its dependencies, and a start script for running the application.

#### Step 4: Running the Release

To run the release, navigate to the `_build/default/rel/my_app/bin` directory and execute the start script:

```shell
./my_app console
```

This command will start your application in the Erlang shell, allowing you to interact with it and verify that everything is working as expected.

### Configuring Releases

Configuring releases involves specifying which applications and dependencies should be included in the release, as well as how the release should be structured. Relx provides a wide range of configuration options to help you customize the release process.

#### Specifying Applications and Dependencies

In the `rebar.config` file, you can specify which applications and dependencies should be included in the release using the `release` tuple. For example:

```erlang
{release, {my_app, "0.1.0"},
 [my_app,
  sasl,
  lager]}.
```

In this example, the release will include the `my_app`, `sasl`, and `lager` applications.

#### Including the Erlang Runtime

By default, Relx excludes the Erlang runtime from the release. However, in production environments, it's often desirable to include the runtime to ensure that the release is self-contained. You can include the runtime by setting the `include_erts` option to `true`:

```erlang
{include_erts, true}.
```

#### Customizing the Start Script

Relx generates a start script for your release, which you can customize using the `extended_start_script` option. This option enables additional features in the start script, such as support for environment variables and custom command-line arguments:

```erlang
{extended_start_script, true}.
```

### Best Practices for Managing and Distributing Releases

Managing and distributing releases effectively is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of your applications. Here are some best practices to consider:

#### Use Version Control

Always use version control to manage your releases. This allows you to track changes over time, roll back to previous versions if necessary, and collaborate with other developers more effectively.

#### Automate the Release Process

Automate the release process as much as possible to reduce the risk of human error. Tools like Rebar3 and Relx can help automate many aspects of the release process, from building and packaging to deployment.

#### Test Releases Thoroughly

Test your releases thoroughly before deploying them to production. This includes testing the application itself, as well as the release package and start script. Consider using automated testing tools and continuous integration pipelines to streamline the testing process.

#### Monitor Releases in Production

Monitor your releases in production to ensure that they are running smoothly and to detect any issues early. Use logging and monitoring tools to track the performance and health of your applications.

#### Keep Releases Small and Focused

Keep your releases small and focused to minimize the risk of introducing bugs and to make it easier to roll back changes if necessary. Consider using feature flags or other techniques to manage the rollout of new features.

### Visualizing the Release Process

To better understand the release process, let's visualize it using a flowchart. This flowchart illustrates the key steps involved in creating and managing a release with Relx and Rebar3.
