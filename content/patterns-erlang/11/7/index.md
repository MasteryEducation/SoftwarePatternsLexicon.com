## 11.7 Error Handling Patterns with Tagged Tuples

In the world of Erlang, error handling is a crucial aspect of building robust and reliable applications. One of the most common and effective patterns for error handling in Erlang is the use of tagged tuples. This section will delve into the intricacies of using tagged tuples for error handling, providing you with the knowledge to implement this pattern effectively in your Erlang projects.

### Understanding Tagged Tuples

Tagged tuples are a fundamental concept in Erlang used to represent different outcomes of a function, typically success or failure. A tagged tuple is essentially a tuple where the first element is a tag that indicates the type of result, and the subsequent elements provide additional information.

#### Common Tagged Tuples

- **Success Tuple**: `{ok, Result}` - This tuple indicates a successful operation, with `Result` being the outcome of the operation.
- **Error Tuple**: `{error, Reason}` - This tuple represents a failure, with `Reason` providing information about the error.

These tuples allow for a consistent and predictable way to handle different outcomes, making your code easier to read and maintain.

### Implementing Functions with Tagged Tuples

Let's explore how to implement functions that return tagged tuples. Consider a simple function that divides two numbers:

```erlang
-module(math_utils).
-export([divide/2]).

%% Divide two numbers, returning a tagged tuple.
divide(Numerator, Denominator) when Denominator =/= 0 ->
    {ok, Numerator / Denominator};
divide(_, 0) ->
    {error, division_by_zero}.
```

In this example, the `divide/2` function returns `{ok, Result}` if the division is successful, and `{error, division_by_zero}` if the denominator is zero. This pattern provides a clear and concise way to handle potential errors.

### Pattern Matching on Tagged Tuples

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Erlang that allows you to destructure data structures and bind variables to their components. When dealing with tagged tuples, pattern matching enables you to handle different outcomes gracefully.

#### Handling Success and Error Cases

Consider a function that uses the `divide/2` function and handles its result:

```erlang
-module(calculator).
-export([safe_divide/2]).

%% Safely divide two numbers, handling errors.
safe_divide(Numerator, Denominator) ->
    case math_utils:divide(Numerator, Denominator) of
        {ok, Result} ->
            io:format("Division successful: ~p~n", [Result]),
            {ok, Result};
        {error, Reason} ->
            io:format("Error occurred: ~p~n", [Reason]),
            {error, Reason}
    end.
```

In this example, the `safe_divide/2` function uses a `case` expression to pattern match on the result of `math_utils:divide/2`. It handles both the success and error cases, providing appropriate feedback.

### Best Practices for Error Handling with Tagged Tuples

To ensure consistent and effective error handling across your Erlang modules, consider the following best practices:

1. **Consistent Tagging**: Use consistent tags such as `ok` and `error` across your modules to maintain uniformity and predictability.

2. **Descriptive Error Reasons**: Provide meaningful and descriptive error reasons to aid in debugging and understanding the context of errors.

3. **Centralized Error Handling**: Consider centralizing error handling logic in utility modules to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

4. **Document Error Cases**: Clearly document the possible error cases for each function, including the tags and reasons, to aid users of your code.

5. **Graceful Degradation**: Design your system to degrade gracefully in the presence of errors, ensuring that critical functionality remains available.

### Encouraging Robust and Predictable Code

Adopting the tagged tuple pattern for error handling in Erlang encourages the development of robust and predictable code. By clearly defining success and error outcomes, you can build systems that are easier to debug, maintain, and extend.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of error handling with tagged tuples, try modifying the `divide/2` function to handle additional error cases, such as invalid input types. Experiment with pattern matching on the results to see how different outcomes can be managed.

### Visualizing Error Handling with Tagged Tuples

To better understand the flow of error handling with tagged tuples, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Divide Numbers}
    B -->|Success| C[Return {ok, Result}]
    B -->|Error: Division by Zero| D[Return {error, division_by_zero}]
    C --> E[Handle Success]
    D --> F[Handle Error]
    E --> G[End]
    F --> G
```

- [ ] A tuple that contains only numbers
- [ ] A tuple that is always two elements long

> **Explanation:** A tagged tuple is a tuple where the first element serves as a tag to indicate the type of result, such as `ok` or `error`.

### Which of the following is a common success tuple in Erlang?

- [x] `{ok, Result}`
- [ ] `{success, Result}`
