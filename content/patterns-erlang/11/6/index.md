## 11.6 Control Flow with `case`, `if`, and `receive`

In Erlang, control flow constructs are essential for directing the execution of code based on conditions and events. This section delves into the `case`, `if`, and `receive` constructs, which are pivotal in Erlang's functional and concurrent programming paradigms. We will explore their syntax, use cases, and best practices, with a focus on writing clear and maintainable conditional logic.

### Understanding Control Flow in Erlang

Control flow in Erlang is distinct from imperative languages due to its functional nature. Instead of using loops and mutable state, Erlang relies on recursion and pattern matching to control the flow of execution. Let's explore the three primary constructs: `case`, `if`, and `receive`.

### The `case` Construct

The `case` construct in Erlang is used to match a value against a series of patterns, executing the corresponding block of code for the first matching pattern. It is similar to a switch statement in other languages but more powerful due to Erlang's pattern matching capabilities.

#### Syntax of `case`

```erlang
case Expression of
    Pattern1 [when Guard1] -> 
        Expression1;
    Pattern2 [when Guard2] -> 
        Expression2;
    ...
    PatternN [when GuardN] -> 
        ExpressionN
end
```

- **Expression**: The value to be matched against the patterns.
- **Pattern**: A pattern to match the expression.
- **Guard**: An optional condition that must be true for the pattern to match.
- **ExpressionN**: The code block executed if the pattern matches.

#### Example of `case`

```erlang
-module(case_example).
-export([evaluate_grade/1]).

evaluate_grade(Score) ->
    case Score of
        S when S >= 90 -> 
            "A";
        S when S >= 80 -> 
            "B";
        S when S >= 70 -> 
            "C";
        S when S >= 60 -> 
            "D";
        _ -> 
            "F"
    end.
```

In this example, `evaluate_grade/1` uses a `case` construct to determine a letter grade based on a numeric score. The use of guards (`when S >= 90`) allows for additional conditions beyond simple pattern matching.

#### Best Practices for `case`

- **Use Guards Wisely**: Guards can make your `case` statements more expressive and precise.
- **Avoid Complex Logic**: Keep each branch simple to maintain readability.
- **Pattern Order Matters**: Arrange patterns from most specific to least specific to ensure correct matching.

### The `if` Construct

The `if` construct in Erlang evaluates a series of boolean expressions, executing the block of code for the first true condition. Unlike `case`, `if` does not use pattern matching.

#### Syntax of `if`

```erlang
if
    Condition1 -> 
        Expression1;
    Condition2 -> 
        Expression2;
    ...
    true -> 
        DefaultExpression
end
```

- **Condition**: A boolean expression.
- **ExpressionN**: The code block executed if the condition is true.
- **true**: A catch-all condition that acts as a default case.

#### Example of `if`

```erlang
-module(if_example).
-export([check_temperature/1]).

check_temperature(Temp) ->
    if
        Temp > 30 -> 
            "It's hot!";
        Temp < 10 -> 
            "It's cold!";
        true -> 
            "It's moderate."
    end.
```

In this example, `check_temperature/1` uses an `if` construct to categorize temperature into hot, cold, or moderate.

#### Best Practices for `if`

- **Use for Simple Conditions**: `if` is best suited for straightforward boolean checks.
- **Always Include a Default**: Use `true` as a default to handle unexpected cases.
- **Consider Readability**: For complex conditions, consider using `case` or refactoring into separate functions.

### The `receive` Construct

The `receive` construct is unique to Erlang's concurrency model, allowing processes to handle messages from their mailbox. It is a cornerstone of Erlang's actor model.

#### Syntax of `receive`

```erlang
receive
    Pattern1 [when Guard1] -> 
        Expression1;
    Pattern2 [when Guard2] -> 
        Expression2;
    ...
    PatternN [when GuardN] -> 
        ExpressionN
after Timeout ->
    TimeoutExpression
end
```

- **Pattern**: A pattern to match incoming messages.
- **Guard**: An optional condition for the pattern.
- **Timeout**: An optional timeout period in milliseconds.
- **TimeoutExpression**: Code executed if no message is received within the timeout.

#### Example of `receive`

```erlang
-module(receive_example).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    spawn(fun() -> loop() end).

loop() ->
    receive
        {hello, From} -> 
            io:format("Received hello from ~p~n", [From]),
            loop();
        {goodbye, From} -> 
            io:format("Received goodbye from ~p~n", [From]),
            loop();
        stop -> 
            io:format("Stopping~n")
    after 5000 ->
        io:format("No message received in 5 seconds~n"),
        loop()
    end.
```

In this example, the `loop/0` function uses `receive` to handle messages like `{hello, From}` and `{goodbye, From}`. If no message is received within 5 seconds, a timeout message is printed.

#### Best Practices for `receive`

- **Use Timeouts**: Always consider using timeouts to avoid blocking indefinitely.
- **Pattern Match Carefully**: Ensure patterns are specific enough to handle expected messages.
- **Avoid Complex Logic**: Keep the logic within `receive` simple to maintain clarity.

### Choosing the Right Control Flow Mechanism

When deciding between `case`, `if`, and `receive`, consider the following:

- **Use `case`** when you need pattern matching and guards.
- **Use `if`** for simple boolean conditions.
- **Use `receive`** for handling messages in concurrent processes.

### Role of Pattern Matching in Control Flow

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Erlang that simplifies control flow by allowing concise and expressive conditions. It is integral to `case` and `receive`, enabling developers to write clear and maintainable code.

### Writing Clear and Maintainable Conditional Logic

- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid nesting control flow constructs deeply.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name variables and functions clearly to convey intent.
- **Refactor When Necessary**: Break down complex logic into smaller functions.

### Visualizing Control Flow

To better understand how these constructs work, let's visualize the flow of a `case` statement:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Evaluate Expression}
    B -->|Pattern1 Matches| C[Execute Expression1]
    B -->|Pattern2 Matches| D[Execute Expression2]
    B -->|PatternN Matches| E[Execute ExpressionN]
    B -->|No Match| F[Error]
```

This diagram illustrates the decision-making process in a `case` statement, where the expression is evaluated against multiple patterns.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided examples by modifying conditions, patterns, and messages. Try adding new branches to the `case` and `receive` constructs or changing the conditions in the `if` construct to see how the behavior changes.
