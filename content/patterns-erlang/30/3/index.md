### Creational Patterns

#### Factory Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Factory {
        +createProduct()
    }
    class Product
    Factory --> Product
```

- **Key Participants**: Factory, Product
- **Applicability**: Use when a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Leverage Erlang's module system to create factory functions that return different module implementations.

#### Builder Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Builder {
        +buildPart()
    }
    class Product
    Builder --> Product
```

- **Key Participants**: Builder, Product
- **Applicability**: Use when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Use functional composition to build complex data structures incrementally.

#### Singleton Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -instance
        +getInstance()
    }
```

- **Key Participants**: Singleton
- **Applicability**: Use when exactly one instance of a class is needed.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Utilize Erlang's process dictionary or application environment for singleton-like behavior.

### Structural Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, allowing classes to work together that couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    Adapter --> Adaptee
```

- **Key Participants**: Adapter, Adaptee
- **Applicability**: Use when you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Implement adapters using Erlang's behavior modules to provide a uniform interface.

#### Proxy Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Proxy {
        +request()
    }
    class RealSubject {
        +request()
    }
    Proxy --> RealSubject
```

- **Key Participants**: Proxy, RealSubject
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to control access to an object.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Use processes as proxies to manage access and control over resources.

#### Decorator Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Decorator {
        +operation()
    }
    class Component {
        +operation()
    }
    Decorator --> Component
```

- **Key Participants**: Decorator, Component
- **Applicability**: Use to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Use higher-order functions to wrap and extend functionality.

---

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Strategy {
        +algorithmInterface()
    }
    class Context {
        +setStrategy(Strategy)
        +executeStrategy()
    }
    Context --> Strategy
```

- **Key Participants**: Strategy, Context
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to use different variants of an algorithm.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Implement strategies using higher-order functions and passing them as parameters.

#### Observer Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Observer {
        +update()
    }
    class Subject {
        +attach(Observer)
        +detach(Observer)
        +notify()
    }
    Subject --> Observer
```

- **Key Participants**: Observer, Subject
- **Applicability**: Use when an object should notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Use Erlang's message passing to implement observer-like behavior.

#### Command Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Structure Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        +execute()
    }
    class Invoker {
        +setCommand(Command)
        +executeCommand()
    }
    Invoker --> Command
```

- **Key Participants**: Command, Invoker
- **Applicability**: Use to parameterize objects with operations.
- **Erlang Unique Features**: Use message passing to encapsulate commands and send them to processes.

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use Patterns**: Consider the problem context and the specific requirements of your application. Patterns are not one-size-fits-all solutions and should be applied judiciously.
- **Erlang-Specific Features**: Leverage Erlang's strengths in concurrency, fault tolerance, and functional programming when implementing patterns.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoid overusing patterns or applying them inappropriately. Ensure that the pattern chosen aligns with the problem being solved.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Factory vs. Builder**: Both are creational patterns, but Factory is used for creating objects without specifying the exact class, while Builder is used for constructing complex objects step by step.
- **Adapter vs. Proxy**: Adapter is used to change the interface of an existing object, while Proxy controls access to an object.
- **Strategy vs. Command**: Strategy is about choosing an algorithm at runtime, while Command encapsulates a request as an object.
