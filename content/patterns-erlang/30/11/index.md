## 30.11 Erlang Style Guides and Conventions

In the world of software development, maintaining a consistent style across your codebase is crucial for readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Erlang, with its unique functional and concurrent programming paradigms, is no exception. In this section, we will delve into the style guides and conventions that are essential for writing clean, efficient, and understandable Erlang code. We will explore key recommendations, discuss the importance of consistency, and provide resources for further reading.

### Importance of Consistent Style in Erlang

Consistent coding style is not just about aesthetics; it plays a vital role in:

- **Readability**: Code that adheres to a consistent style is easier to read and understand, reducing the cognitive load on developers.
- **Maintainability**: Consistent code is easier to maintain and refactor, as developers can quickly grasp the structure and flow of the code.
- **Collaboration**: In team environments, a consistent style ensures that all team members can work on the codebase without confusion or misinterpretation.
- **Error Reduction**: A well-defined style guide helps prevent common errors and misunderstandings in code interpretation.

### Key Style Recommendations

Let's explore some of the key style recommendations for writing Erlang code. These guidelines are derived from [Erlang's official programming rules](https://www.erlang.org/doc/programming_rules/) and other reputable sources.

#### 1. Naming Conventions

- **Modules**: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (e.g., `my_module`).
- **Functions**: Use lowercase letters and underscores, similar to modules (e.g., `calculate_sum`).
- **Variables**: Start with an uppercase letter or an underscore (e.g., `Result`, `_Temp`).
- **Atoms**: Use lowercase letters and underscores (e.g., `ok`, `error_occurred`).

#### 2. Code Layout

- **Indentation**: Use spaces for indentation, typically two spaces per indentation level.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters to ensure readability across different devices and editors.
- **Blank Lines**: Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code, enhancing readability.

#### 3. Comments

- **Single-Line Comments**: Use the `%` symbol for single-line comments. Place comments above the code they describe.
- **Block Comments**: Use multiple `%` symbols for block comments. Ensure comments are meaningful and provide context.

```erlang
% Calculate the sum of two numbers
% Returns the result as an integer
sum(A, B) ->
    A + B.
```

#### 4. Function Definitions

- **Arity**: Clearly specify the arity of functions in comments or documentation (e.g., `sum/2`).
- **Pattern Matching**: Use pattern matching effectively to simplify code and enhance readability.

```erlang
% Calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(0) -> 1;
factorial(N) when N > 0 -> N * factorial(N - 1).
```

#### 5. Error Handling

- **Let It Crash**: Embrace Erlang's "let it crash" philosophy by allowing processes to fail and be restarted by supervisors.
- **Tagged Tuples**: Use tagged tuples for error handling, providing clear and consistent error messages.

```erlang
% Open a file and handle potential errors
open_file(FileName) ->
    case file:open(FileName, [read]) of
        {ok, File} -> {ok, File};
        {error, Reason} -> {error, Reason}
    end.
```

#### 6. Code Organization

- **Modules**: Organize code into modules based on functionality. Each module should have a clear purpose and responsibility.
- **Exports**: Only export functions that are necessary for external use. Keep internal functions private to the module.

```erlang
-module(my_module).
-export([public_function/1]).

% Private function
private_function() ->
    % Implementation
    ok.

% Public function
public_function(Arg) ->
    private_function(),
    % Further implementation
    ok.
```

### Visualizing Erlang Code Structure

To better understand how Erlang code is structured, let's visualize a simple module using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class MyModule {
        +public_function(Arg)
        -private_function()
    }
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram represents a simple Erlang module with one public function (`public_function`) and one private function (`private_function`). The `+` symbol denotes a public function, while the `-` symbol denotes a private function.

### Adopting a Style Guide

While the recommendations above provide a solid foundation, it's important for teams to adopt or adapt a style guide that suits their specific needs. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Evaluate Existing Guides**: Review existing style guides, such as [Erlang's official programming rules](https://www.erlang.org/doc/programming_rules/), to understand common practices.
2. **Customize for Your Team**: Adapt the style guide to fit your team's workflow, project requirements, and personal preferences.
3. **Document and Share**: Clearly document the style guide and make it accessible to all team members. Consider using version control to track changes.
4. **Enforce Consistency**: Use code linters and automated tools to enforce the style guide across the codebase.
5. **Review and Revise**: Regularly review and update the style guide to accommodate new practices and technologies.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of Erlang style guides and conventions, try modifying the following code snippet to adhere to the style recommendations discussed above:

```erlang
-module(sample).
-export([calc/2]).

calc(A,B) -> A+B.
```

**Suggestions**:
- Add meaningful comments.
- Use proper indentation and line length.
- Rename the module and function to follow naming conventions.
