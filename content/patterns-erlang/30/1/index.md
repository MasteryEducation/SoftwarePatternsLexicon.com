## 30.1 Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions of key technical terms and concepts used throughout the guide. It serves as a quick reference for readers to understand the terminology related to Erlang, OTP (Open Telecom Platform), design patterns, and functional programming. Each term is explained clearly and concisely, with cross-references to relevant sections in the guide where applicable.

### A

- **Actor Model**: A conceptual model for concurrent computation in which "actors" are the universal primitives of concurrent computation. In Erlang, processes are actors that communicate via message passing. See [Section 4.1: The Actor Model and Erlang Processes](#4.1-the-actor-model-and-erlang-processes).

- **Anonymous Function**: A function defined without a name, often used for short-lived operations. In Erlang, they are created using the `fun` keyword. See [Section 2.5: Anonymous Functions and Closures](#2.5-anonymous-functions-and-closures).

```erlang
% Example of an anonymous function
Square = fun(X) -> X * X end.
```

- **Applicative Order**: An evaluation strategy where the arguments to a function are evaluated before the function itself is applied. This is the default strategy in Erlang.

### B

- **BEAM**: The virtual machine at the core of the Erlang runtime system, responsible for executing compiled Erlang code. It supports concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance.

- **Behaviour**: A design pattern in Erlang used to define a set of functions that a module must implement. Common behaviours include `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, and `supervisor`. See [Section 6.2: OTP Behaviours](#6.2-otp-behaviours).

- **Bitstring**: A data type in Erlang used to handle sequences of bits. It is often used for binary data manipulation. See [Section 3.1.3: Binaries and Bitstrings](#3.1.3-binaries-and-bitstrings).

### C

- **Closure**: A function along with a referencing environment for the non-local variables of that function. Closures allow functions to capture variables from their surrounding scope. See [Section 2.5: Anonymous Functions and Closures](#2.5-anonymous-functions-and-closures).

- **Concurrency**: The ability of a system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Erlang's concurrency model is based on lightweight processes and message passing. See [Section 4: Concurrency in Erlang](#4-concurrency-in-erlang).

- **Currying**: The process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. See [Section 11.2: Currying and Partial Application](#11.2-currying-and-partial-application).

### D

- **Dialyzer**: A static analysis tool for Erlang that identifies software discrepancies such as type errors, unreachable code, and unnecessary tests. See [Section 3.9: Typespecs and Dialyzer for Static Analysis](#3.9-typespecs-and-dialyzer-for-static-analysis).

- **Distributed Erlang**: A feature of Erlang that allows multiple Erlang runtime systems to communicate and work together as a single system. See [Section 5: Distributed Programming in Erlang](#5-distributed-programming-in-erlang).

- **Dynamic Typing**: A type system where type checking is performed at runtime, allowing for more flexibility in code but requiring careful runtime error handling.

### E

- **ETS (Erlang Term Storage)**: An in-memory storage system for Erlang terms, providing fast access to large amounts of data. See [Section 7.13: ETS: In-Memory Storage Patterns](#7.13-ets-in-memory-storage-patterns).

- **EUnit**: A unit testing framework for Erlang, used to write and execute tests to ensure code correctness. See [Section 13.13: Testing with EUnit and Common Test](#13.13-testing-with-eunit-and-common-test).

- **Erlang Shell (REPL)**: An interactive command-line interface for executing Erlang expressions and testing code snippets. See [Section 3.6: Effective Use of the Erlang Shell (REPL)](#3.6-effective-use-of-the-erlang-shell-repl).

### F

- **Factory Pattern**: A creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. In Erlang, this can be implemented using functions and modules. See [Section 8.2: Factory Pattern with Functions and Modules](#8.2-factory-pattern-with-functions-and-modules).

- **Fault Tolerance**: The ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. Erlang's "let it crash" philosophy supports building fault-tolerant systems. See [Section 2.8: The "Let It Crash" Philosophy](#2.8-the-let-it-crash-philosophy).

- **First-Class Function**: A function that can be treated like any other variable, passed as an argument, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable. See [Section 2.2: First-Class and Higher-Order Functions](#2.2-first-class-and-higher-order-functions).

### G

- **Gen_Server**: A generic server behaviour in OTP that abstracts the common patterns of a server process, simplifying the implementation of concurrent servers. See [Section 6.4: Implementing Servers with `gen_server`](#6.4-implementing-servers-with-gen_server).

### K

- **List Comprehension**: A concise way to create lists in Erlang, using a syntax similar to set notation in mathematics. See [Section 3.4: List Comprehensions and Generators](#3.4-list-comprehensions-and-generators).

```erlang
% Example of a list comprehension
Squares = [X*X || X <- lists:seq(1, 10)].
```

- **Observer Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes. See [Section 10.2: Observer Pattern with Publish/Subscribe](#10.2-observer-pattern-with-publish-subscribe).

### P

- **Pattern Matching**: A mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. It is a fundamental feature in Erlang, used in variable binding, function clauses, and case expressions. See [Section 2.3: Pattern Matching and Guards](#2.3-pattern-matching-and-guards).

- **Process**: The basic unit of concurrency in Erlang, lightweight and isolated, communicating with other processes via message passing. See [Section 4.1: The Actor Model and Erlang Processes](#4.1-the-actor-model-and-erlang-processes).

- **Prototype Pattern**: A creational design pattern used to create objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning. In Erlang, this can be achieved through process cloning. See [Section 8.5: Prototype Pattern through Process Cloning](#8.5-prototype-pattern-through-process-cloning).

### Q

- **Synchronous Messaging**: A communication method where the sender waits for a response from the receiver before continuing execution. See [Section 4.3: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Messaging](#4.3-synchronous-vs-asynchronous-messaging).

- **State Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. In Erlang, this can be implemented using `gen_statem`. See [Section 10.6: State Pattern with `gen_statem`](#10.6-state-pattern-with-gen_statem).

### T

- **Tail Call Optimization**: An optimization technique where the last call in a function is optimized to avoid adding a new stack frame, allowing for efficient recursion. See [Section 2.4: Recursion and Tail Call Optimization](#2.4-recursion-and-tail-call-optimization).

- **Tuple**: A fixed-size collection of values in Erlang, used to group related data. Tuples are immutable and can contain elements of different types. See [Section 3.1.1: Lists, Tuples, and Arrays](#3.1.1-lists-tuples-and-arrays).
