## 2.3.8 State

In the realm of software design, the State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on its state, making it appear as if the object has changed its class.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of the State pattern is to allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is beneficial in scenarios where an object has multiple states, each requiring different behavior. By encapsulating state-specific behavior within separate state objects, the State pattern helps in managing state transitions cleanly and efficiently.

### Implementation Steps

Implementing the State pattern in Go involves several key steps:

1. **State Interface**
   - Define an interface that declares methods corresponding to actions that vary by state.

2. **Concrete State Structs**
   - Implement the state interface in concrete structs, each representing a specific state and its corresponding behavior.

3. **Context**
   - Create a context struct that holds a reference to a state object.
   - Delegate state-specific behavior to the state object.
   - Manage state transitions by changing the state object reference.

### When to Use

The State pattern is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- When an object's behavior depends on its state.
- To simplify complex conditional logic based on state.
- When you want to make state transitions explicit and manageable.

### Go-Specific Tips

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulate state transitions within state structs or the context to maintain clean separation of concerns.
- **Interfaces:** Use interfaces to define state behaviors, allowing for flexible and interchangeable state implementations.

### Example: Vending Machine

Let's explore a practical example of a vending machine that behaves differently based on its state. The vending machine can be in one of several states: `HasCoin`, `NoCoin`, and `SoldOut`. We'll demonstrate how the State pattern can be used to manage these states and their transitions.

#### State Interface

First, we define the `State` interface, which declares the methods that each state must implement:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// State interface declares methods for state-specific behavior.
type State interface {
	InsertCoin()
	DispenseProduct()
}
```

#### Concrete State Structs

Next, we implement the concrete state structs: `HasCoinState`, `NoCoinState`, and `SoldOutState`.

```go
// HasCoinState represents the state of the vending machine when it has a coin.
type HasCoinState struct {
	vendingMachine *VendingMachine
}

func (s *HasCoinState) InsertCoin() {
	fmt.Println("Coin already inserted.")
}

func (s *HasCoinState) DispenseProduct() {
	fmt.Println("Dispensing product...")
	s.vendingMachine.SetState(s.vendingMachine.noCoinState)
}

// NoCoinState represents the state of the vending machine when it has no coin.
type NoCoinState struct {
	vendingMachine *VendingMachine
}

func (s *NoCoinState) InsertCoin() {
	fmt.Println("Coin inserted.")
	s.vendingMachine.SetState(s.vendingMachine.hasCoinState)
}

func (s *NoCoinState) DispenseProduct() {
	fmt.Println("Insert coin first.")
}

// SoldOutState represents the state of the vending machine when it is sold out.
type SoldOutState struct {
	vendingMachine *VendingMachine
}

func (s *SoldOutState) InsertCoin() {
	fmt.Println("Machine is sold out.")
}

func (s *SoldOutState) DispenseProduct() {
	fmt.Println("Machine is sold out.")
}
```

#### Context

The `VendingMachine` struct acts as the context, holding a reference to the current state and managing state transitions.

```go
// VendingMachine represents the context that maintains a reference to the current state.
type VendingMachine struct {
	hasCoinState  State
	noCoinState   State
	soldOutState  State
	currentState  State
}

func NewVendingMachine() *VendingMachine {
	vm := &VendingMachine{}
	hasCoinState := &HasCoinState{vendingMachine: vm}
	noCoinState := &NoCoinState{vendingMachine: vm}
	soldOutState := &SoldOutState{vendingMachine: vm}

	vm.hasCoinState = hasCoinState
	vm.noCoinState = noCoinState
	vm.soldOutState = soldOutState
	vm.currentState = noCoinState

	return vm
}

func (vm *VendingMachine) SetState(state State) {
	vm.currentState = state
}

func (vm *VendingMachine) InsertCoin() {
	vm.currentState.InsertCoin()
}

func (vm *VendingMachine) DispenseProduct() {
	vm.currentState.DispenseProduct()
}
```

#### Usage

Here's how you can use the `VendingMachine` with the State pattern:

```go
func main() {
	vendingMachine := NewVendingMachine()

	vendingMachine.InsertCoin()
	vendingMachine.DispenseProduct()

	vendingMachine.InsertCoin()
	vendingMachine.DispenseProduct()

	vendingMachine.InsertCoin()
	vendingMachine.DispenseProduct()
}
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- **Simplifies Code:** Reduces complex conditional logic by encapsulating state-specific behavior.
- **Encapsulation:** State transitions are managed within the state objects or context, promoting encapsulation.
- **Flexibility:** New states and behaviors can be added without modifying existing code.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Increased Complexity:** Introduces additional classes/structs for each state, which can increase complexity.
- **Overhead:** May introduce overhead if the number of states is small and the logic is simple.

### Best Practices

- **Encapsulate Transitions:** Keep state transitions within state objects or the context to maintain clear separation of concerns.
- **Use Interfaces:** Leverage interfaces to define state behaviors, allowing for flexible and interchangeable implementations.
- **Avoid Overuse:** Use the State pattern judiciously, especially in scenarios where the number of states is limited and the logic is straightforward.

### Comparisons

The State pattern is often compared with the Strategy pattern. While both patterns encapsulate behavior, the State pattern is focused on managing state transitions, whereas the Strategy pattern is about selecting algorithms at runtime.

### Conclusion

The State pattern is a powerful tool for managing state-dependent behavior in Go applications. By encapsulating state-specific behavior and transitions, it simplifies code and enhances maintainability. However, it should be used judiciously to avoid unnecessary complexity.
