## 2.3.2 Command

The Command design pattern is a behavioral pattern from the Gang of Four (GoF) collection that encapsulates a request as an object. This encapsulation allows for parameterization, queuing of requests, and supports undoable operations. In this article, we will explore the Command pattern in the context of Go, providing detailed explanations, code examples, and best practices.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of the Command pattern is to decouple the sender of a request from the object that executes the request. By encapsulating requests as objects, the pattern allows for:

- **Parameterization of Objects with Operations:** Commands can be passed around as first-class objects, enabling flexible invocation of operations.
- **Queuing and Logging of Requests:** Commands can be stored in a queue or log, facilitating batch processing and auditing.
- **Support for Undoable Operations:** By maintaining a history of executed commands, the pattern can support undo functionality.

### Implementation Steps

To implement the Command pattern in Go, follow these steps:

1. **Define a Command Interface:** Create an interface with an `Execute()` method that all command objects will implement.

2. **Implement Concrete Command Structs:** For each action, implement a concrete struct that adheres to the Command interface.

3. **Create an Invoker:** Develop an invoker that holds and calls the commands.

4. **Optionally Implement Undo Functionality:** If undo functionality is required, extend the Command interface to include an `Undo()` method.

### When to Use

Consider using the Command pattern in the following scenarios:

- **Parameterizing Objects with Operations:** When you need to pass operations as arguments to other objects.
- **Queuing or Logging Requests:** When you need to queue requests for later execution or log them for auditing purposes.
- **Supporting Undoable Operations:** When your application requires undo functionality.

### Go-Specific Tips

- **Use Function Types as Commands:** In Go, you can use function types to represent commands, simplifying the implementation.
- **Store Commands in Slices:** Utilize slices to store commands for batch processing or implementing undo functionality.

### Example: Text Editor Actions

Let's illustrate the Command pattern with a practical example involving a text editor where commands represent actions like copy and paste.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Command interface with Execute method
type Command interface {
    Execute()
}

// Concrete Command for Copy
type CopyCommand struct {
    editor *TextEditor
}

func (c *CopyCommand) Execute() {
    c.editor.Copy()
}

// Concrete Command for Paste
type PasteCommand struct {
    editor *TextEditor
}

func (p *PasteCommand) Execute() {
    p.editor.Paste()
}

// Receiver class
type TextEditor struct {
    clipboard string
    content   string
}

func (t *TextEditor) Copy() {
    t.clipboard = t.content
    fmt.Println("Copied content to clipboard:", t.clipboard)
}

func (t *TextEditor) Paste() {
    t.content += t.clipboard
    fmt.Println("Pasted content:", t.content)
}

// Invoker class
type CommandInvoker struct {
    history []Command
}

func (i *CommandInvoker) StoreAndExecute(cmd Command) {
    i.history = append(i.history, cmd)
    cmd.Execute()
}

func main() {
    editor := &TextEditor{content: "Hello, World!"}
    copyCmd := &CopyCommand{editor: editor}
    pasteCmd := &PasteCommand{editor: editor}

    invoker := &CommandInvoker{}
    invoker.StoreAndExecute(copyCmd)
    invoker.StoreAndExecute(pasteCmd)
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

- **Command Interface:** Defines the `Execute()` method that all commands must implement.
- **Concrete Commands:** `CopyCommand` and `PasteCommand` implement the `Command` interface, encapsulating the actions of copying and pasting.
- **Receiver:** `TextEditor` is the object that performs the actual operations.
- **Invoker:** `CommandInvoker` stores and executes commands, maintaining a history for potential undo functionality.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- **Decoupling:** Separates the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.
- **Flexibility:** Commands can be parameterized and passed around easily.
- **Undo/Redo Support:** Facilitates implementing undoable operations.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complexity:** Can introduce additional complexity with numerous command classes.
- **Overhead:** May lead to increased memory usage if many commands are stored.

### Best Practices

- **Use Function Types for Simplicity:** In Go, consider using function types to represent simple commands.
- **Batch Processing:** Store commands in slices for batch execution or undo functionality.
- **SOLID Principles:** Adhere to SOLID principles to ensure maintainable and scalable command implementations.

### Comparisons with Other Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern:** While both patterns encapsulate actions, the Command pattern focuses on requests and supports undo functionality, whereas the Strategy pattern is about selecting algorithms at runtime.
- **Chain of Responsibility:** The Command pattern encapsulates requests, while the Chain of Responsibility passes requests along a chain of handlers.

### Conclusion

The Command pattern is a powerful tool in Go for encapsulating requests as objects, providing flexibility, and supporting undoable operations. By following best practices and leveraging Go's unique features, developers can implement this pattern effectively to enhance their applications.
