## 2.3.10 Template Method

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple classes that share similar algorithms with some differing steps, and you want to prevent code duplication.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of the Template Method pattern is to:

- Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- Allow subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

This pattern is beneficial in scenarios where you need a consistent algorithm structure but require flexibility in specific steps. It promotes code reuse and adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Implementation Steps

Implementing the Template Method pattern in Go involves the following steps:

#### 1. Abstract Class or Struct

- **Define the Template Method:** Create a method that outlines the algorithm's steps. This method should call other methods representing the steps of the algorithm.
- **Implement Invariant Steps:** Implement the steps that remain constant across subclasses within the template method.

#### 2. Primitive Operations

- **Declare Abstract or Placeholder Methods:** Define methods for the steps that can vary. In Go, you can use interfaces or function arguments to achieve this flexibility.

#### 3. Concrete Implementations

- **Create Concrete Types:** Implement the variable steps in concrete types that satisfy the interface or provide specific implementations for the placeholder methods.

### When to Use

Consider using the Template Method pattern in the following scenarios:

- When you have multiple classes that share similar algorithms with some differing steps.
- To prevent code duplication by centralizing the algorithm structure in a single place.
- When you want to enforce a consistent algorithm structure while allowing flexibility in specific steps.

### Go-Specific Tips

In Go, you can leverage interfaces and composition to emulate inheritance, which is typically used in object-oriented languages to implement the Template Method pattern. Additionally, you can pass function arguments to methods to introduce variable behavior if appropriate.

### Example: Data Parser

Let's explore a practical example of the Template Method pattern in Go by implementing a data parser that reads, processes, and writes data. We'll create different parsers for XML and JSON, each implementing the processing step differently.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// DataParser defines the interface for our template method
type DataParser interface {
	ReadData() string
	ProcessData(data string) string
	WriteData(data string)
	Parse() // Template method
}

// BaseParser provides the template method implementation
type BaseParser struct {
	DataParser
}

func (b *BaseParser) Parse() {
	data := b.ReadData()
	processedData := b.ProcessData(data)
	b.WriteData(processedData)
}

// XMLParser implements the DataParser interface for XML
type XMLParser struct {
	BaseParser
}

func (x *XMLParser) ReadData() string {
	fmt.Println("Reading XML data...")
	return "<data>XML Data</data>"
}

func (x *XMLParser) ProcessData(data string) string {
	fmt.Println("Processing XML data...")
	return "Processed " + data
}

func (x *XMLParser) WriteData(data string) {
	fmt.Println("Writing XML data:", data)
}

// JSONParser implements the DataParser interface for JSON
type JSONParser struct {
	BaseParser
}

func (j *JSONParser) ReadData() string {
	fmt.Println("Reading JSON data...")
	return `{"data": "JSON Data"}`
}

func (j *JSONParser) ProcessData(data string) string {
	fmt.Println("Processing JSON data...")
	return "Processed " + data
}

func (j *JSONParser) WriteData(data string) {
	fmt.Println("Writing JSON data:", data)
}

func main() {
	xmlParser := &XMLParser{}
	xmlParser.BaseParser.DataParser = xmlParser
	xmlParser.Parse()

	jsonParser := &JSONParser{}
	jsonParser.BaseParser.DataParser = jsonParser
	jsonParser.Parse()
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

In this example, we have defined a `DataParser` interface that outlines the methods required for parsing data. The `BaseParser` struct implements the `Parse` method, which serves as the template method. It calls `ReadData`, `ProcessData`, and `WriteData` in sequence.

The `XMLParser` and `JSONParser` structs implement the `DataParser` interface, providing specific implementations for reading, processing, and writing XML and JSON data, respectively. By embedding `BaseParser` and setting the `DataParser` field, we ensure that the correct methods are called during parsing.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Code Reuse:** Centralizes the algorithm structure, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.
- **Flexibility:** Allows subclasses to implement specific steps, providing flexibility while maintaining a consistent algorithm structure.
- **Maintainability:** Changes to the algorithm structure are made in one place, simplifying maintenance.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity:** Can introduce complexity if overused or applied to simple algorithms.
- **Limited Flexibility:** The algorithm structure is fixed, which may not be suitable for highly dynamic scenarios.

### Best Practices

- **Use Sparingly:** Apply the Template Method pattern when you have a clear need for a consistent algorithm structure with variable steps.
- **Leverage Interfaces:** Use interfaces to define the variable steps, promoting flexibility and adherence to Go's idiomatic practices.
- **Avoid Overengineering:** Ensure that the pattern is necessary and not overcomplicating the design.

### Comparisons

The Template Method pattern is often compared to the Strategy pattern. While both patterns allow for flexibility in behavior, the Template Method pattern defines the algorithm structure, whereas the Strategy pattern allows for complete algorithm interchangeability.

### Conclusion

The Template Method pattern is a powerful tool for defining consistent algorithm structures with flexible steps. By leveraging Go's interfaces and composition, you can implement this pattern effectively, promoting code reuse and maintainability. As with any design pattern, it's essential to apply it judiciously, ensuring it aligns with your project's needs and complexity.
