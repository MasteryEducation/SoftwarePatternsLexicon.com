## 2.2.3 Composite

### Introduction

The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that enables you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful when you need to work with complex tree structures, such as file systems, organizational hierarchies, or graphical user interfaces.

### Understanding the Intent

The primary intent of the Composite pattern is to allow clients to interact with individual objects and compositions of objects through a common interface. This uniformity simplifies client code and enhances flexibility, as clients do not need to distinguish between simple and complex components.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define a Component Interface:**
   - Create an interface that declares the methods used by both simple and complex objects. This interface will be implemented by all components in the hierarchy.

2. **Implement Leaf Structs:**
   - Leaf structs represent the end objects in the hierarchy, which do not have any children. They implement the component interface directly.

3. **Implement Composite Structs:**
   - Composite structs can have child components, which can be either leaves or other composites. They also implement the component interface and delegate operations to their children.

4. **Ensure Uniformity:**
   - Composites should implement the component interface and delegate operations to their children, allowing clients to treat all components uniformly.

### When to Use

- When you need to represent hierarchical structures with complex relationships.
- To allow clients to work with both simple and complex objects through the same interface, simplifying client code.

### Go-Specific Tips

- Use slices or maps to manage child components within composites, providing flexibility in managing collections of children.
- Implement recursive methods carefully to avoid infinite loops, especially when traversing or manipulating the hierarchy.

### Example: File System

Let's explore a practical example of a file system, where files are leaves and directories are composites. This example will demonstrate how operations like `List()` or `GetSize()` can be performed uniformly.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Component interface
type Component interface {
	List(indent string)
	GetSize() int
}

// File struct - Leaf
type File struct {
	name string
	size int
}

func (f *File) List(indent string) {
	fmt.Println(indent + f.name)
}

func (f *File) GetSize() int {
	return f.size
}

// Directory struct - Composite
type Directory struct {
	name     string
	children []Component
}

func (d *Directory) List(indent string) {
	fmt.Println(indent + d.name)
	for _, child := range d.children {
		child.List(indent + "  ")
	}
}

func (d *Directory) GetSize() int {
	totalSize := 0
	for _, child := range d.children {
		totalSize += child.GetSize()
	}
	return totalSize
}

func (d *Directory) Add(child Component) {
	d.children = append(d.children, child)
}

func main() {
	// Create files
	file1 := &File{name: "File1.txt", size: 120}
	file2 := &File{name: "File2.txt", size: 80}
	file3 := &File{name: "File3.txt", size: 200}

	// Create directories
	dir1 := &Directory{name: "Dir1"}
	dir2 := &Directory{name: "Dir2"}

	// Build the tree structure
	dir1.Add(file1)
	dir1.Add(file2)
	dir2.Add(file3)
	dir2.Add(dir1)

	// List the directory structure
	fmt.Println("Directory Structure:")
	dir2.List("")

	// Get total size
	fmt.Printf("\nTotal Size: %d bytes\n", dir2.GetSize())
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

- **Component Interface:** The `Component` interface defines `List()` and `GetSize()` methods, which are implemented by both `File` and `Directory`.
- **File Struct:** Represents a leaf node with no children. It implements the `Component` interface directly.
- **Directory Struct:** Represents a composite node that can contain children. It implements the `Component` interface and delegates operations to its children.
- **Tree Structure:** The example builds a tree structure with directories and files, demonstrating how operations can be performed uniformly.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- **Uniformity:** Clients can treat all components uniformly, simplifying client code.
- **Flexibility:** Easily add new types of components without changing existing code.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for complex hierarchical structures.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complexity:** The pattern can introduce complexity, especially in simple scenarios.
- **Overhead:** May introduce overhead due to the abstraction of components.

### Best Practices

- **Interface Design:** Design the component interface carefully to ensure it meets the needs of both simple and complex components.
- **Recursive Methods:** Implement recursive methods with care to avoid infinite loops and ensure efficient traversal.
- **Memory Management:** Consider memory usage when managing large numbers of components, especially in resource-constrained environments.

### Comparisons

The Composite pattern is often compared with other structural patterns like Decorator and Proxy. While Decorator adds responsibilities to objects dynamically, Composite focuses on part-whole hierarchies. Proxy, on the other hand, provides a surrogate for another object.

### Conclusion

The Composite design pattern is a powerful tool for managing hierarchical structures in Go. By allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, it simplifies client code and enhances flexibility. When implemented correctly, it provides a scalable solution for complex tree structures.
