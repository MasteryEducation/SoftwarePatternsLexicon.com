## 2.1.5 Singleton

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a single instance of a class is required to coordinate actions across the system, such as managing configurations, logging, or connection pooling.

### Purpose of the Singleton Pattern

- **Ensure a Single Instance:** The primary goal of the Singleton pattern is to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object. This is crucial when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
- **Global Access Point:** It provides a global access point to the instance, allowing it to be accessed from anywhere in the application.
- **Control Access to Shared Resources:** By ensuring a single instance, the Singleton pattern helps control access to shared resources, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistency.

### Implementation Steps

Implementing the Singleton pattern in Go involves several key steps to ensure thread safety and proper initialization:

1. **Declare a Package-Level Variable:** Create a package-level variable to hold the singleton instance. This variable will be accessed by the function that returns the singleton.

2. **Create a Function to Return the Singleton:** Implement a function that returns the singleton instance. This function should initialize the instance if it hasn't been created yet.

3. **Ensure Thread-Safe Initialization:** Use `sync.Once` to ensure that the singleton instance is initialized only once, even in concurrent environments. This prevents race conditions and ensures thread safety.

### Go-Specific Tips

- **Utilize Package-Level Variables:** In Go, package-level variables are a simple way to manage the singleton instance. They provide a natural scope for the singleton and are easily accessible within the package.

- **Cautious Use of `init()` Functions:** While `init()` functions can be used for initialization, it's often better to use explicit initialization to avoid hidden dependencies and improve code clarity.

- **Concurrency Considerations:** Go's concurrency model requires careful handling of shared resources. Use synchronization primitives like `sync.Once` to ensure thread-safe initialization of the singleton instance.

### Example: Singleton Logger

Let's implement a singleton logger in Go that writes to a single log file. This example demonstrates how to safely access the singleton from multiple goroutines.

```go
package logger

import (
	"log"
	"os"
	"sync"
)

type Logger struct {
	file *os.File
	*log.Logger
}

var (
	instance *Logger
	once     sync.Once
)

// GetInstance returns the singleton instance of Logger.
func GetInstance() *Logger {
	once.Do(func() {
		file, err := os.OpenFile("app.log", os.O_APPEND|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0666)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Failed to open log file: %v", err)
		}
		instance = &Logger{
			file:   file,
			Logger: log.New(file, "APP_LOG: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile),
		}
	})
	return instance
}

// Close closes the log file.
func (l *Logger) Close() {
	l.file.Close()
}
```

### Accessing the Singleton from Multiple Goroutines

Here's how you can use the singleton logger from multiple goroutines safely:

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
	"your_project/logger"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		log := logger.GetInstance()
		log.Println("Log message from goroutine 1")
	}()

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		log := logger.GetInstance()
		log.Println("Log message from goroutine 2")
	}()

	wg.Wait()
}
```

### When to Use the Singleton Pattern

- **Single Instance Requirement:** Use the Singleton pattern when you need only one instance of a class across the application, such as for configuration management or logging.
- **Shared Resource Management:** It's ideal for managing shared resources like database connections or thread pools, where multiple instances could lead to conflicts or resource exhaustion.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- **Controlled Access:** Provides controlled access to a single instance, ensuring consistency and preventing conflicts.
- **Global Access:** Offers a global point of access, simplifying the use of the instance across different parts of the application.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Global State:** Singleton can introduce global state into an application, which can make testing and debugging more challenging.
- **Hidden Dependencies:** It can lead to hidden dependencies, making the code harder to understand and maintain.

### Best Practices

- **Lazy Initialization:** Use lazy initialization to create the singleton instance only when it's needed, optimizing resource usage.
- **Thread Safety:** Ensure thread safety using synchronization primitives like `sync.Once` to prevent race conditions.
- **Avoid Overuse:** Use the Singleton pattern judiciously, as it can introduce global state and hidden dependencies.

### Conclusion

The Singleton pattern is a powerful tool for ensuring a single instance of a class and providing a global access point. In Go, careful attention to concurrency and initialization ensures that the pattern is implemented safely and effectively. By following best practices and understanding the pattern's advantages and disadvantages, developers can leverage the Singleton pattern to manage shared resources and configurations efficiently.
