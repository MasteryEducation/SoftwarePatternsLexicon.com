## 2.1.2 Builder

The Builder pattern is a powerful creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. This pattern is particularly useful when an object requires multiple steps to be constructed or when there are several representations of the object that need to be created using the same construction process.

### Purpose of the Builder Pattern

- **Separation of Construction and Representation:** The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Flexibility in Object Creation:** It enables the creation of complex objects with various configurations without altering the client code.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define a Builder Interface:**
   - Create an interface that outlines the methods required to configure the object. Each method should return the builder itself to allow for method chaining.

2. **Implement Concrete Builders:**
   - Develop concrete builder types that implement the builder interface. Each concrete builder will construct a specific variant of the object.

3. **Create a Director:**
   - Implement a director function or type that orchestrates the building process. The director uses the builder interface to construct the object in a step-by-step manner.

### When to Use

- **Complex Object Construction:** When constructing an object involves multiple steps or configurations.
- **Multiple Representations:** When you need to create different representations of an object using the same construction process.

### Go-Specific Tips

- **Functional Options:** Consider using functional options to enhance the flexibility and readability of your builder pattern implementation.
- **Immutability:** Favor immutability by returning new instances rather than modifying existing ones, which can help prevent unintended side effects.

### Example: Building a Custom HTTP Request

Let's explore a practical example of using the Builder pattern in Go to construct a custom HTTP request.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

// RequestBuilder defines the interface for building HTTP requests.
type RequestBuilder interface {
	Method(method string) RequestBuilder
	URL(url string) RequestBuilder
	Header(key, value string) RequestBuilder
	Build() (*http.Request, error)
}

// HTTPRequestBuilder is a concrete builder for constructing HTTP requests.
type HTTPRequestBuilder struct {
	method string
	url    string
	headers map[string]string
}

// NewHTTPRequestBuilder creates a new instance of HTTPRequestBuilder.
func NewHTTPRequestBuilder() *HTTPRequestBuilder {
	return &HTTPRequestBuilder{
		headers: make(map[string]string),
	}
}

// Method sets the HTTP method for the request.
func (b *HTTPRequestBuilder) Method(method string) RequestBuilder {
	b.method = method
	return b
}

// URL sets the URL for the request.
func (b *HTTPRequestBuilder) URL(url string) RequestBuilder {
	b.url = url
	return b
}

// Header adds a header to the request.
func (b *HTTPRequestBuilder) Header(key, value string) RequestBuilder {
	b.headers[key] = value
	return b
}

// Build constructs the HTTP request.
func (b *HTTPRequestBuilder) Build() (*http.Request, error) {
	req, err := http.NewRequest(b.method, b.url, nil)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	for key, value := range b.headers {
		req.Header.Set(key, value)
	}
	return req, nil
}

func main() {
	builder := NewHTTPRequestBuilder()
	request, err := builder.Method("GET").
		URL("https://api.example.com/data").
		Header("Accept", "application/json").
		Build()

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error building request:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Request built successfully:", request)
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

- **Builder Interface:** The `RequestBuilder` interface defines methods for setting the HTTP method, URL, and headers.
- **Concrete Builder:** The `HTTPRequestBuilder` struct implements the `RequestBuilder` interface, providing concrete methods to set request parameters.
- **Method Chaining:** Each method returns the builder itself, allowing for method chaining to construct the request fluently.
- **Director Functionality:** The `Build` method acts as the director, orchestrating the construction of the `http.Request` object.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- **Improved Readability:** Method chaining makes the code more readable and expressive.
- **Flexibility:** Easily create different configurations of an object.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clean separation between the construction process and the final representation.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity:** Introduces additional complexity with the need for multiple builder types.
- **Overhead:** May add unnecessary overhead for simple object constructions.

### Best Practices

- **Use Functional Options:** Enhance flexibility by using functional options to set optional parameters.
- **Ensure Immutability:** Return new instances rather than modifying existing ones to maintain immutability.
- **Keep Builders Simple:** Avoid adding too much logic to builders; they should focus on constructing objects.

### Comparisons with Other Patterns

- **Factory Method vs. Builder:** The Factory Method pattern is suitable for creating objects with a single step, whereas the Builder pattern is ideal for complex objects requiring multiple steps.
- **Prototype vs. Builder:** The Prototype pattern is used for cloning existing objects, while the Builder pattern constructs new objects step-by-step.

### Conclusion

The Builder pattern is a versatile tool in the Go programmer's toolkit, especially when dealing with complex object construction. By separating the construction process from the representation, it provides flexibility and clarity, making it easier to manage and extend codebases.
