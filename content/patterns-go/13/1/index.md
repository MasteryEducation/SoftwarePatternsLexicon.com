## 13.1 Authentication and Authorization Patterns

In today's digital landscape, securing applications is paramount. Authentication and authorization are critical components of application security, ensuring that users are who they claim to be and have the appropriate permissions to access resources. This article delves into the patterns and practices for implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in Go applications.

### Introduction to Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, while authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Together, they form the backbone of application security, protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance with security standards.

### Implement Robust Authentication

#### Secure Password Storage

Storing passwords securely is crucial to prevent unauthorized access in case of a data breach. Go provides several libraries to facilitate secure password storage:

- **Use Secure Hashing Algorithms:** Employ algorithms like `bcrypt` to hash passwords before storing them. `bcrypt` is designed to be computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks more difficult.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt"
)

func hashPassword(password string) (string, error) {
	bytes, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), bcrypt.DefaultCost)
	return string(bytes), err
}

func checkPasswordHash(password, hash string) bool {
	err := bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword([]byte(hash), []byte(password))
	return err == nil
}

func main() {
	password := "mySuperSecretPassword"
	hash, _ := hashPassword(password)

	fmt.Println("Password:", password)
	fmt.Println("Hash:    ", hash)

	match := checkPasswordHash(password, hash)
	fmt.Println("Match:   ", match)
}
```

- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enhance security by requiring additional verification methods, such as SMS codes or authenticator apps, alongside passwords.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors. This can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised passwords.

- **Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP):** Use libraries like `github.com/pquerna/otp/totp` to generate and verify time-based one-time passwords.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/pquerna/otp/totp"
)

func main() {
	key, err := totp.Generate(totp.GenerateOpts{
		Issuer:      "ExampleApp",
		AccountName: "user@example.com",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Secret:", key.Secret())

	// Simulate user entering a TOTP code
	code, err := totp.GenerateCode(key.Secret(), time.Now())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Generated Code:", code)

	valid := totp.Validate(code, key.Secret())
	fmt.Println("Code Valid:", valid)
}
```

### Authorization Mechanisms

Authorization ensures that authenticated users have the necessary permissions to access resources. Go applications can implement various authorization mechanisms:

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC assigns permissions to roles rather than individual users, simplifying permission management and enhancing security.

- **Define Roles and Permissions:** Create a mapping of roles to permissions and assign roles to users.

```go
type Role string

const (
	Admin Role = "admin"
	User  Role = "user"
)

type Permission string

const (
	Read  Permission = "read"
	Write Permission = "write"
)

var rolePermissions = map[Role][]Permission{
	Admin: {Read, Write},
	User:  {Read},
}

func hasPermission(role Role, permission Permission) bool {
	for _, p := range rolePermissions[role] {
		if p == permission {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

#### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ACLs provide fine-grained access control by specifying which users or roles can access specific resources.

- **Implement ACLs:** Define access rules for resources and check these rules during access requests.

```go
type Resource string

const (
	Document Resource = "document"
)

type ACL struct {
	Resource   Resource
	Permission Permission
	Role       Role
}

var aclList = []ACL{
	{Document, Read, User},
	{Document, Write, Admin},
}

func canAccess(role Role, resource Resource, permission Permission) bool {
	for _, acl := range aclList {
		if acl.Role == role && acl.Resource == resource && acl.Permission == permission {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

### Session Management

Session management is crucial for maintaining user state and ensuring secure interactions with the application.

#### Secure Cookies

- **Use Secure Cookies:** Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags to prevent client-side scripts from accessing cookies and ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

```go
import (
	"net/http"
)

func setSecureCookie(w http.ResponseWriter, name, value string) {
	cookie := &http.Cookie{
		Name:     name,
		Value:    value,
		HttpOnly: true,
		Secure:   true,
	}
	http.SetCookie(w, cookie)
}
```

#### Session Timeouts and Refresh Tokens

- **Implement Session Timeouts:** Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Use Refresh Tokens:** Implement refresh tokens to extend session duration securely without requiring users to log in again.

### Visual Aids

#### Authentication and Authorization Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User] -->|Login| B[Authentication Server]
    B -->|Validate Credentials| C{Credentials Valid?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Generate Token]
    C -->|No| E[Access Denied]
    D --> F[User Access]
    F -->|Request Resource| G[Authorization Server]
    G -->|Check Permissions| H{Authorized?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Access Granted]
    H -->|No| J[Access Denied]
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages
