## 6.2 Functional Composition

Functional composition is a powerful concept in functional programming that allows developers to build complex operations by combining simpler functions. In Go, while the language is not purely functional, it supports functional programming paradigms, including functional composition, which can lead to more modular, readable, and maintainable code.

### Introduction to Functional Composition

Functional composition involves creating new functions by combining existing ones. This is achieved by chaining function calls such that the output of one function becomes the input to another. This approach can simplify complex operations by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable functions.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Combining Functions

In Go, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. This feature enables the combination of functions to create new functionality.

**Example: Basic Function Composition**

Consider two simple functions, `add` and `multiply`, which perform addition and multiplication, respectively. We can compose these functions to create a new function that first adds two numbers and then multiplies the result by a third number.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// add returns the sum of two integers.
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// multiply returns the product of two integers.
func multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b
}

// compose combines two functions into a new function.
func compose(f, g func(int, int) int) func(int, int, int) int {
    return func(x, y, z int) int {
        return g(f(x, y), z)
    }
}

func main() {
    addThenMultiply := compose(add, multiply)
    result := addThenMultiply(2, 3, 4) // (2 + 3) * 4 = 20
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
}
```

In this example, `compose` is a higher-order function that takes two functions, `f` and `g`, and returns a new function that applies `f` and then `g`.

#### Implementing Pipelines

Pipelines are a common pattern in functional programming where data is processed through a series of functions. Each function in the pipeline transforms the data and passes it to the next function.

**Example: Data Processing Pipeline**

Let's create a pipeline that processes a slice of integers by filtering out even numbers, doubling the remaining numbers, and then summing them up.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// filter returns a new slice containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.
func filter(nums []int, predicate func(int) bool) []int {
    var result []int
    for _, num := range nums {
        if predicate(num) {
            result = append(result, num)
        }
    }
    return result
}

// map applies a function to each element of a slice, returning a new slice.
func mapFunc(nums []int, mapper func(int) int) []int {
    var result []int
    for _, num := range nums {
        result = append(result, mapper(num))
    }
    return result
}

// reduce aggregates the elements of a slice using a binary function.
func reduce(nums []int, initial int, reducer func(int, int) int) int {
    result := initial
    for _, num := range nums {
        result = reducer(result, num)
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

    // Pipeline: Filter, Map, Reduce
    oddNumbers := filter(numbers, func(n int) bool { return n%2 != 0 })
    doubledNumbers := mapFunc(oddNumbers, func(n int) int { return n * 2 })
    sum := reduce(doubledNumbers, 0, func(a, b int) int { return a + b })

    fmt.Println("Sum of doubled odd numbers:", sum) // Output: 50
}
```

In this example, we use three functions—`filter`, `mapFunc`, and `reduce`—to create a data processing pipeline. Each function performs a specific transformation, and together they achieve the desired result.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the concept of functional composition and pipelines, let's visualize the data flow through a pipeline using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]] --> B[Filter: Odd Numbers];
    B --> C[Double: Each Number];
    C --> D[Reduce: Sum];
    D --> E[Output: 50];
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Modularity:** Breaking down complex operations into smaller functions enhances code modularity.
- **Reusability:** Composed functions can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Readability:** Pipelines make the data transformation process more readable and easier to follow.

#### Disadvantages

- **Performance Overhead:** Function calls can introduce overhead, especially in performance-critical applications.
- **Complexity:** Overusing composition can lead to complex and hard-to-debug code if not managed properly.

### Best Practices

- **Keep Functions Small:** Ensure each function performs a single task to maintain clarity and simplicity.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Name functions clearly to convey their purpose and improve code readability.
- **Avoid Deep Nesting:** Limit the depth of function composition to prevent complexity and maintainability issues.

### Comparisons

Functional composition can be compared with other design patterns like the Chain of Responsibility, where the output of one handler is passed to the next. However, functional composition is more about combining pure functions, while the Chain of Responsibility involves objects and state.

### Conclusion

Functional composition in Go allows developers to create powerful and flexible data processing pipelines by combining simple functions. By leveraging Go's support for first-class functions, developers can build modular, reusable, and readable code. While there are some performance considerations, the benefits of functional composition often outweigh the drawbacks, especially in applications where maintainability and clarity are priorities.
