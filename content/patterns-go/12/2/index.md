## 12.2 Data Mapper

In the world of software development, the Data Mapper pattern serves as a crucial bridge between in-memory objects and database tables. This pattern is particularly valuable in Go applications, where it helps maintain a clean separation between the domain model and the persistence layer. By using the Data Mapper pattern, developers can ensure that their domain objects remain independent of the database schema, promoting flexibility and scalability.

### Purpose of the Data Mapper Pattern

The primary purpose of the Data Mapper pattern is to map between in-memory objects and database tables while keeping them independent of each other. This separation of concerns allows developers to focus on the business logic within the domain model without worrying about the intricacies of database interactions.

### Implementation Steps

Implementing the Data Mapper pattern in Go involves several key steps:

#### 1. Define Mapper Functions

The first step is to write functions that convert between domain objects and their database representations. These functions are responsible for translating the fields of a struct into the corresponding columns of a database table and vice versa.

```go
type User struct {
    ID       int
    Username string
    Email    string
    Password string
}

// ToDB converts a User struct to a map suitable for database operations.
func (u *User) ToDB() map[string]interface{} {
    return map[string]interface{}{
        "id":       u.ID,
        "username": u.Username,
        "email":    u.Email,
        "password": u.Password,
    }
}

// FromDB populates a User struct from a database row.
func FromDB(row map[string]interface{}) *User {
    return &User{
        ID:       row["id"].(int),
        Username: row["username"].(string),
        Email:    row["email"].(string),
        Password: row["password"].(string),
    }
}
```

#### 2. Implement Persistence Logic

Once the mapper functions are defined, they can be used within repository or DAO (Data Access Object) methods to handle database operations. This step involves writing methods that use the mapper functions to interact with the database.

```go
type UserRepository struct {
    db *sql.DB
}

func (repo *UserRepository) Save(user *User) error {
    query := "INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"
    _, err := repo.db.Exec(query, user.ID, user.Username, user.Email, user.Password)
    return err
}

func (repo *UserRepository) FindByID(id int) (*User, error) {
    query := "SELECT id, username, email, password FROM users WHERE id = ?"
    row := repo.db.QueryRow(query, id)

    var user User
    err := row.Scan(&user.ID, &user.Username, &user.Email, &user.Password)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &user, nil
}
```

### Best Practices

To effectively implement the Data Mapper pattern in Go, consider the following best practices:

- **Centralize Mapping Logic:** Keep all mapping logic in one place to avoid duplication and ensure consistency across the application.
- **Leverage Libraries:** Use libraries such as `sqlx` or ORM tools like `gorm` to simplify the mapping process and reduce boilerplate code.
- **Maintain Separation of Concerns:** Ensure that domain objects remain free of database-specific logic to maintain a clean separation between the domain model and the persistence layer.

### Example: Mapping a User Struct

Let's consider a practical example where we map a `User` struct to a `users` table in a database. This example demonstrates how to handle field transformations and database interactions using the Data Mapper pattern.

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

type User struct {
    ID       int
    Username string
    Email    string
    Password string
}

type UserRepository struct {
    db *sql.DB
}

func (repo *UserRepository) Save(user *User) error {
    query := "INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"
    _, err := repo.db.Exec(query, user.ID, user.Username, user.Email, user.Password)
    return err
}

func (repo *UserRepository) FindByID(id int) (*User, error) {
    query := "SELECT id, username, email, password FROM users WHERE id = ?"
    row := repo.db.QueryRow(query, id)

    var user User
    err := row.Scan(&user.ID, &user.Username, &user.Email, &user.Password)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &user, nil
}

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    userRepo := &UserRepository{db: db}

    // Save a new user
    newUser := &User{ID: 1, Username: "johndoe", Email: "john@example.com", Password: "securepassword"}
    err = userRepo.Save(newUser)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error saving user:", err)
        return
    }

    // Retrieve a user by ID
    user, err := userRepo.FindByID(1)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error finding user:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Printf("User found: %+v\n", user)
}
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Separation of Concerns:** The Data Mapper pattern promotes a clear separation between the domain model and the database schema, enhancing maintainability.
- **Flexibility:** Changes to the database schema do not directly impact the domain model, allowing for greater flexibility in evolving the application.
- **Testability:** By isolating database interactions, the Data Mapper pattern makes it easier to test domain logic independently.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity:** Implementing the Data Mapper pattern can introduce additional complexity, especially in large applications with numerous domain objects.
- **Performance Overhead:** The abstraction layer introduced by the Data Mapper pattern may incur a performance overhead, particularly in high-throughput applications.

### Best Practices for Effective Implementation

- **Use Interfaces:** Define interfaces for your repositories to allow for easy swapping of implementations and facilitate testing.
- **Optimize Queries:** Ensure that database queries are optimized for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage database errors and ensure application stability.

### Comparisons with Other Patterns

The Data Mapper pattern is often compared with the Active Record pattern. While both patterns aim to map objects to database tables, they differ in their approach:

- **Data Mapper:** Keeps domain objects and database interactions separate, promoting a clean separation of concerns.
- **Active Record:** Combines domain logic and database interactions within the same object, which can lead to tighter coupling.

### Conclusion

The Data Mapper pattern is a powerful tool for managing the interaction between in-memory objects and database tables in Go applications. By maintaining a clear separation between the domain model and the persistence layer, this pattern enhances flexibility, maintainability, and testability. However, developers should be mindful of the potential complexity and performance overhead associated with its implementation.
