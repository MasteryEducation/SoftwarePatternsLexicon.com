## 12.5 Unit of Work

The Unit of Work pattern is a crucial design pattern in data management, particularly when dealing with complex transactions involving multiple operations. It helps track changes to objects during a transaction and ensures that these changes are coordinated and committed to the database in a single, atomic operation. This pattern is especially useful in scenarios where consistency and integrity of data are paramount.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the Unit of Work pattern is to:

- **Track Changes:** Keep track of changes to objects during a transaction, including new, modified, and deleted entities.
- **Coordinate Commit:** Ensure that all changes are committed to the database in a single transaction, maintaining data integrity.
- **Rollback on Error:** Provide a mechanism to roll back changes if any errors occur during the transaction, preventing partial updates.

### Implementation Steps

Implementing the Unit of Work pattern in Go involves several key steps:

#### 1. Implement Unit of Work Struct

Create a struct to represent the Unit of Work, which will keep track of entities that have been added, modified, or deleted during a transaction.

```go
type UnitOfWork struct {
    newEntities    []Entity
    modifiedEntities []Entity
    deletedEntities  []Entity
    db              *sql.DB
}

func NewUnitOfWork(db *sql.DB) *UnitOfWork {
    return &UnitOfWork{
        newEntities:    make([]Entity, 0),
        modifiedEntities: make([]Entity, 0),
        deletedEntities:  make([]Entity, 0),
        db:              db,
    }
}
```

#### 2. Commit and Rollback Methods

Implement methods to commit changes to the database or roll back if errors occur.

```go
func (uow *UnitOfWork) Commit() error {
    tx, err := uow.db.Begin()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    defer func() {
        if p := recover(); p != nil {
            tx.Rollback()
            panic(p)
        } else if err != nil {
            tx.Rollback()
        } else {
            err = tx.Commit()
        }
    }()

    for _, entity := range uow.newEntities {
        if err = insertEntity(tx, entity); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    for _, entity := range uow.modifiedEntities {
        if err = updateEntity(tx, entity); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    for _, entity := range uow.deletedEntities {
        if err = deleteEntity(tx, entity); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    return nil
}

func (uow *UnitOfWork) Rollback() {
    uow.newEntities = nil
    uow.modifiedEntities = nil
    uow.deletedEntities = nil
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Use Transactions:** Leverage transactions provided by Go's `database/sql` package to ensure atomicity and consistency.
- **Thread Safety:** If multiple goroutines access the Unit of Work, ensure thread safety by using synchronization mechanisms like mutexes.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage transaction rollbacks effectively.

### Example: Shopping Cart System

Consider a shopping cart system where adding items to the cart and updating inventory must be committed together to maintain consistency.

```go
type CartItem struct {
    ProductID int
    Quantity  int
}

func (uow *UnitOfWork) AddCartItem(item CartItem) {
    uow.newEntities = append(uow.newEntities, item)
}

func (uow *UnitOfWork) UpdateInventory(productID int, quantity int) {
    // Assume Inventory is a type that represents the inventory state
    inventory := Inventory{ProductID: productID, Quantity: quantity}
    uow.modifiedEntities = append(uow.modifiedEntities, inventory)
}

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "user=postgres dbname=shop sslmode=disable")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    uow := NewUnitOfWork(db)

    uow.AddCartItem(CartItem{ProductID: 1, Quantity: 2})
    uow.UpdateInventory(1, -2)

    if err := uow.Commit(); err != nil {
        log.Printf("Transaction failed: %v", err)
        uow.Rollback()
    } else {
        log.Println("Transaction succeeded")
    }
}
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- **Consistency:** Ensures all changes are applied consistently within a transaction.
- **Error Management:** Simplifies error handling by allowing a single rollback operation.
- **Decoupling:** Decouples business logic from data access logic, promoting cleaner code.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complexity:** Can introduce additional complexity in managing the state of entities.
- **Performance:** May impact performance due to the overhead of tracking changes.

### Best Practices

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulate all database operations within the Unit of Work to maintain a clean separation of concerns.
- **Testing:** Write comprehensive tests to ensure that commit and rollback operations work as expected.
- **Logging:** Implement logging to track transaction states and errors for easier debugging.

### Comparisons

The Unit of Work pattern is often compared with the Repository pattern. While the Repository pattern abstracts data access, the Unit of Work pattern manages transaction boundaries and entity states. They can be used together to create a robust data management layer.

### Conclusion

The Unit of Work pattern is a powerful tool for managing complex transactions in Go applications. By tracking changes and coordinating commits, it ensures data consistency and integrity. Implementing this pattern requires careful consideration of transaction management and error handling, but the benefits in terms of maintainability and reliability are significant.
