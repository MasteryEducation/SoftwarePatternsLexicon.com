## 5.5 Context for Cancellation

In modern software development, managing concurrency effectively is crucial for building responsive and efficient applications. Go, with its powerful concurrency model, provides the `context` package as a fundamental tool for managing deadlines, cancellations, and request-scoped data across goroutines. This section delves into the usage of context for cancellation, highlighting best practices and providing practical examples to illustrate its application.

### Introduction to Context in Go

The `context` package in Go is designed to carry deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between goroutines. It is a key component in writing robust concurrent programs, allowing developers to manage the lifecycle of operations and ensure resources are cleaned up when operations are no longer needed.

### Context Usage

#### Passing `context.Context` Through Call Chains

In Go, it is a common practice to pass `context.Context` as the first parameter to functions that perform I/O operations or other long-running tasks. This allows the caller to control the execution of these functions, including the ability to cancel them if necessary.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func doWork(ctx context.Context) {
    select {
    case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Work completed")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Work cancelled:", ctx.Err())
    }
}

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    go doWork(ctx)

    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    cancel() // Cancel the context to stop the work
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}
```

In this example, `doWork` is a function that simulates a long-running task. By passing a context to it, we can cancel the task after 2 seconds, demonstrating how context can be used to manage the lifecycle of goroutines.

#### Creating Cancellable Contexts

Go provides several functions to create contexts with cancellation capabilities:

- `context.WithCancel`: Returns a copy of the parent context with a new Done channel. The cancel function should be called to cancel the context.
- `context.WithTimeout`: Returns a copy of the parent context with a timeout. The context is automatically cancelled after the specified duration.
- `context.WithDeadline`: Similar to `WithTimeout`, but allows specifying an exact time for the context to be cancelled.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func doWorkWithTimeout(ctx context.Context) {
    select {
    case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Work completed")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Work cancelled:", ctx.Err())
    }
}

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Second)
    defer cancel() // Ensure resources are cleaned up

    go doWorkWithTimeout(ctx)

    time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
}
```

Here, `doWorkWithTimeout` uses a context with a timeout of 3 seconds. The work is cancelled automatically when the timeout is reached, demonstrating how contexts can manage time-bound operations.

### Cancellation Propagation

One of the key benefits of using context is its ability to propagate cancellation signals across goroutines. This ensures that when a parent context is cancelled, all derived contexts and their associated operations are also cancelled.

#### Ensuring Goroutines Check the Context

Goroutines should regularly check the context's Done channel to determine if they should exit early. This is crucial for ensuring that resources are not wasted on operations that are no longer needed.

```go
func doWorkWithCheck(ctx context.Context) {
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            fmt.Println("Goroutine cancelled:", ctx.Err())
            return
        default:
            fmt.Println("Working...")
            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the goroutine checks the context's Done channel in each iteration of the loop, allowing it to exit promptly when the context is cancelled.

#### Cleaning Up Resources

When a context is cancelled, it is important to clean up any resources that were allocated for the operation. This includes closing files, network connections, or any other resources that need explicit cleanup.

```go
func doWorkWithCleanup(ctx context.Context) {
    defer fmt.Println("Cleaning up resources")

    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            fmt.Println("Goroutine cancelled:", ctx.Err())
            return
        default:
            fmt.Println("Working...")
            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}
```

By using `defer`, we ensure that resources are cleaned up when the goroutine exits, whether due to completion or cancellation.

### Best Practices

#### Do Not Store Contexts Inside Structs

Contexts should not be stored inside structs or passed around as global variables. Instead, they should be passed explicitly to functions that need them. This ensures that the context is always relevant to the current operation and avoids unintended side effects.

#### Use Contexts for Request-Scoped Data

Contexts are ideal for carrying request-scoped data, such as authentication tokens or user IDs, across API boundaries. However, they should not be used for passing optional parameters or configuration settings.

```go
func processRequest(ctx context.Context) {
    userID := ctx.Value("userID")
    fmt.Println("Processing request for user:", userID)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), "userID", 42)
    processRequest(ctx)
}
```

In this example, the context carries a user ID that is relevant to the current request, demonstrating how contexts can be used to pass request-scoped data.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Simplifies Cancellation:** Contexts provide a unified way to manage cancellation across goroutines, simplifying code and reducing the risk of resource leaks.
- **Propagates Deadlines:** Contexts can carry deadlines across API boundaries, ensuring that timeouts are consistently enforced.
- **Encapsulates Request-Scoped Data:** Contexts allow passing request-scoped data without modifying function signatures to include additional parameters.

#### Disadvantages

- **Potential Misuse:** Using contexts for non-request-scoped data or storing them in structs can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Overhead:** Passing contexts through call chains can introduce some overhead, particularly if contexts are used inappropriately.

### Conclusion

The `context` package is a powerful tool for managing concurrency in Go applications. By using contexts to handle cancellations and deadlines, developers can write more robust and efficient code. Following best practices, such as passing contexts explicitly and using them for request-scoped data, ensures that contexts are used effectively and appropriately.
