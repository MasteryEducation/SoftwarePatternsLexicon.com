## Description

The Outrigger Dimension pattern involves creating a secondary dimension table (often called an outrigger) that is linked to another primary dimension table instead of directly connected to the fact table. This pattern is useful in managing complex relationships within your data model and maintaining a balance between normalization and denormalization strategies, especially when designing star schemas.

### When to Use

Outrigger dimensions are typically employed when you have a dimension that is more granular or detailed than can practically reside within a single dimension table. This pattern allows for breaking out specific, frequently changing attributes that still need to relate back to a primary dimension.

An example might include a "Geography" dimension table that includes detailed location-related attributes. Instead of incorporating these detailed attributes directly into a broader "Store" dimension (thus making it unwieldy), they are separated into an outrigger dimension.

## Example

Consider a scenario with a `Store` dimension containing attributes like `StoreID`, `StoreName`, and `StoreType`. Suppose each store can be associated with a specific region, and this geographical information includes `RegionID`, `RegionName`, and `Country`. You would implement an outrigger dimension to store this geographical data instead of expanding the `Store` dimension with these additional attributes.

```plaintext
+-------------+              +-------------+
|  Store      |              | Geography   |
+-------------+              +-------------+
| StoreID     |------------->| RegionID    |
| StoreName   |              | RegionName  |
| StoreType   |              | Country     |
| RegionID    |              +-------------+
+-------------+
```

## Benefits

- **Reduced Redundancy**: Prevents the repetition of volatile or detailed attributes within a primary dimension.
- **Normalized Approach**: Manages complex attribute sets effectively.
- **Flexible Maintenance**: Makes it easier to update secondary attributes independently without affecting the main dimension structure.

## Best Practices

- Use outrigger dimensions sparingly to avoid making schemas unnecessarily complex.
- Ensure that the access patterns for data do not lead to performance issues due to added joins.
- Always weigh the benefit of normalization against potential query performance impacts in your analysis phase.

## Related Patterns

- **Star Schema**: Outrigger dimensions can be a component of star schema designs, reducing redundancy.
- **Snowflake Schema**: A more normalized form, including outrigger dimensions, might lead to a snowflake schema design.
- **Conformed Dimension**: This concept can interact with outriggers, especially in building consistent reporting dimensions.

## Additional Resources

- Ralph Kimball's "The Data Warehouse Toolkit" for foundational understanding of dimensional modeling patterns.
- Online forums and publications such as "The Data Warehouse Institute" (TDWI) for community insights and case studies.

## Summary

The Outrigger Dimension pattern provides a structured method to manage dimensions that require detailed and frequently updated attribute sets independent of the primary dimension to which they belong. It is best utilized in scenarios where maintaining balance between normalization and ease of reporting is a priority, ensuring dimensional models are efficient and performant. By understanding outrigger dimensions and when to appropriately apply them, architects can deliver flexible yet robust data warehouse designs.
