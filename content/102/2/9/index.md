## Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD1)

### Description
The Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD1) design pattern is an approach in dimensional modeling where old data is overwritten with new data. This pattern is commonly used in data warehousing when the maintenance of a historical record of changes is not necessary. It is straightforward and easy to implement, focusing on keeping only the most current information.

When you update data in an SCD1 dimension, you replace the existing data within the dimension table with new values, thus no historical changes are preserved. This is suitable for data attributes that are not critical for historical analysis and where the accuracy of current data takes precedence over historical records.

### Architectural Approach
In designing a data warehouse with SCD1, the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process plays a crucial role. During the load phase for a dimension table:
- An incoming data record with a dimension key is checked against existing records.
- If the record already exists, updated values are written over the existing fields.
- If the record does not exist, a new entry is created.

Here’s a basic structure for handling updates with SCD1:

```sql
-- Example: SQL update statement for SCD Type 1

UPDATE CustomerDimension
SET Address = 'new_address', City = 'new_city'
WHERE CustomerID = 'customer_id';
```

### Best Practices
- Use SCD1 for attributes that require precision on the current state and where historical data isn’t necessary.
- Implement thorough auditing or logging mechanisms if you want to track changes externally.
- Ensure that ETL processes are efficient to handle overwrite operations under high load.

### Example Code
Below is a simple ETL procedure for updating an SCD1 type dimension using pseudocode:

```plaintext
for each record in source_data:
    if record.key exists in dimension_table:
        overwrite existing values with new data
    else:
        insert new record

commit changes
```

### Related Patterns
- **Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD2)**: Records multiple historical changes by inserting new rows for changes, maintaining full change histories.
- **Slowly Changing Dimension Type 3 (SCD3)**: Stores limited historical changes by adding new columns for each change, typically just the current and a previous value.

### Summary
The Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD1) pattern is a design pattern for dimensional modeling that focuses on always maintaining up-to-date data by overwriting existing records with new data. It is a simple, efficient solution suited to scenarios where historical data tracking is not necessary. SCD1 is often chosen for dimensions where only the current state is of business importance, such as current contact information, product names, or cost values. Adopting this pattern can simplify ETL processes and reduce storage needs, but developers must consider whether overriding history aligns with business requirements.
