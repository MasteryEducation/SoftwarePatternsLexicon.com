## Mini-Dimension

### Description

The Mini-Dimension pattern involves isolating frequently changing attributes into a separate, smaller dimension table. This pattern enhances performance and manageability by reducing the size of the larger, slower-changing dimensions (known as Slowly Changing Dimensions or SCDs) and speeding up querying and processing.

### Use Case

In dimensional modeling within a data warehouse, when you have a large dimension table, frequent updates on rapidly changing attributes can lead to performance bottlenecks. By using the Mini-Dimension pattern, frequently changing segments of a large dimension are split off into a more manageable size, optimizing processes like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and improving overall system performance.

### Example

Consider a scenario where you have a `Customer` dimension that includes attributes such as `CustomerID`, `Name`, `Address`, `PhoneNumber`, `AgeGroup`, and `IncomeLevel`. Attributes like `AgeGroup` and `IncomeLevel` could change more frequently than others. Instead of storing them in the main `Customer` dimension table, they are placed in a separate `CustomerDemographics` mini-dimension table.

```sql
-- Main Customer Dimension table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20)
);

-- CustomerDemographics Mini-Dimension table
CREATE TABLE CustomerDemographics (
    DemographicsID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    AgeGroup VARCHAR(50),
    IncomeLevel VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Fact table linking to both the main dimension and mini-dimension
CREATE TABLE PurchaseFact (
    PurchaseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    DemographicsID INT,
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    PurchaseDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID),
    FOREIGN KEY (DemographicsID) REFERENCES CustomerDemographics(DemographicsID)
);
```

### Architectural Approach

Creating mini-dimensions allows you to manage attributes that necessitate frequent updates separately, reducing the need to constantly update the main dimension table, which can improve the performance of both ETL processes and querying operations. This separation enhances scalability, as the impact of changes is localized, making it easier for database administrators to manage.

### Related Patterns

- **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)**: Deals with managing and versioning historical changes in dimension data.
- **Junk Dimension**: Combines small dimensions with low cardinality into a single table.
- **Conformed Dimension**: Ensures the same dimension is used consistently across different fact tables or data marts.

### Best Practices

- Use mini-dimensions when attributes change frequently but do not drastically alter data analysis requirements.
- Consider the maintenance overhead of adding and tracking the life cycle of mini-dimensions.
- Assess the impact on existing ETL processes to seamlessly integrate mini-dimensions.

### Summary

The Mini-Dimension pattern provides an efficient way to handle frequently changing dimension attributes without burdening the main dimension structures. By using this pattern, data architects can improve data warehouse performance, manageability, and scalability while ensuring that analytics remain accurate and timely. This approach is particularly beneficial in environments with evolving business needs and rapidly changing data dynamics.
