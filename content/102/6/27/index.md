## Introduction

In software systems where flexibility in data attributes is required, the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model often emerges as a prominent choice for data modeling. However, managing data consistency and integrity can become challenging within an EAV schema due to its dynamic nature. The Dynamic Attribute Validation pattern addresses these challenges by providing a way to validate attribute values using dynamic rules.

## Background

The EAV model, also known as the vertical model or open schema, is widely used in scenarios where entities have a large number of attributes, which are sparsely populated. This model allows for flexible schema definitions but comes with the drawback of making it difficult to enforce strict validation rules like those found in more traditional, strongly-typed schemas.

## Problem Statement

In an EAV system, new attributes can be introduced at any time, and existing attributes can have a wide variety of valid values depending on the circumstances. Static validation rules are insufficient for meeting the needs of such a dynamic system. For instance, checking that attributes like "ExpirationDate" occur after "ManufactureDate" needs a mechanism to enforce business rules dynamically.

## Solution

Dynamic Attribute Validation is a design pattern that solves the problem by allowing rules to be defined and updated without modification to the underlying codebase. Here’s how this approach can be implemented:

### Architectural Approach

1. **Rule Definition Framework**: Develop a framework where validation rules can be defined, stored, and managed separately from application code. This can be achieved using metadata tables or rule engines.

2. **Dynamic Rule Evaluation**: Implement a rule evaluation engine capable of interpreting and executing these rules at runtime. This engine should be integrated into the data management processes so validation occurs during data entry or updates.

3. **Event-Driven Validation**: Use event-driven architecture to trigger validation upon data manipulation events, ensuring data checks are performed before persisting changes.

### Example Code

Below is a pseudo-code example demonstrating how dynamic rules might be applied when saving data:

```scala
// Example of a Validation Engine
class ValidationEngine {
    val rules: Map[String, (Any, Any) => Boolean] = Map()

    def addRule(attributeName: String, rule: (Any, Any) => Boolean): Unit = {
        rules += (attributeName -> rule)
    }

    def validate(name1: String, value1: Any, name2: String, value2: Any): Boolean = {
        rules.get(name1 + ":" + name2).exists(rule => rule(value1, value2))
    }
}

// Usage
val validationEngine = new ValidationEngine

// Define a rule for dates
validationEngine.addRule("ManufactureDate:ExpirationDate", (mDate, eDate) => mDate.asInstanceOf[Date].before(eDate.asInstanceOf[Date]))

val manufactureDate = new Date("2023-01-01")
val expirationDate = new Date("2025-01-01")

if (validationEngine.validate("ManufactureDate", manufactureDate, "ExpirationDate", expirationDate)) {
  println("Validation successful")
} else {
  println("Validation failed: ExpirationDate must be after ManufactureDate")
}
```

### Diagrams

Below is an example of how system components can interact using a dynamic attribute validation engine:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    User ->>+ Application: Submit Data
    Application ->>+ ValidationEngine: Validate Attributes
    ValidationEngine -->> Application: Validation Result
    Application -->> Database: Save Data (if valid)
    Database -->>- Application: Confirmation
    Application -->>- User: Submission Status
```

## Related Patterns

- **Metadata-driven Design**: This pattern underpins how systems can be adapted to changing requirements by externalizing configuration and rules.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Vital for triggering the timely validation of data as events occur across the system.

## Summary

The Dynamic Attribute Validation pattern effectively balances flexibility and consistency in data models by allowing dynamic validation rules. By implementing this pattern, systems can maintain robust data integrity even as requirements change and evolve over time. This makes it particularly useful in dynamic environments where EAV schemas are deployed to accommodate diverse and evolving data storage needs.
