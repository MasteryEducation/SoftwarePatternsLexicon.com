## Overview

The Value-Type Separation pattern is a refinement of the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model, which is a flexible schema designed to handle a large number of attributes in a scalable way. It separates different data types across distinct tables or columns, optimizing for performance and storage efficiency.

### Context

In systems where attributes of entities are dynamic and can vary significantly across different instances, such as product catalogs or patient data in a medical system, traditional relational tables with fixed columns for each attribute may fall short. The EAV model addresses this by allowing diverse and numerous properties to be stored efficiently. However, a given attribute's data type differences can introduce complexity in querying and processing the data.

### Problem

When storing all attribute values together in a single table (as in a basic EAV system), it can lead to inefficiencies:
- Performance issues during data retrieval and manipulation because of type conversions.
- Difficulty in validating data types and constraints leading to data integrity problems.
- Increased storage requirements as the database must account for various data types within the same column. 

### Solution

The Value-Type Separation design pattern suggests breaking out values into separate tables or columns based on their data type. For example, you can separate attribute values into distinct tables or columns for strings, integers, dates, etc. This approach streamlines the querying process and ensures data type validations are more effective.

#### Example Structure

- **Entities Table**: Stores all entities (e.g., products or patients) with a unique identifier.
- **Attributes Table**: Lists all attributes that an entity can have, with attribute metadata.
- **String_Values Table**: Contains only string values.
- **Numeric_Values Table**: Contains numeric attributes.
- **Date_Values Table**: Stores date-type data.

These tables would reference the **Entities Table** and **Attributes Table** via foreign keys and enable efficient querying by isolating data types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Entities (
    entity_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Attributes (
    attribute_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    attribute_name VARCHAR(255),
    data_type ENUM('string', 'integer', 'date')
);

CREATE TABLE String_Values (
    entity_id INT,
    attribute_id INT,
    value TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (entity_id) REFERENCES Entities(entity_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (attribute_id) REFERENCES Attributes(attribute_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Numeric_Values (
    entity_id INT,
    attribute_id INT,
    value DOUBLE,
    FOREIGN KEY (entity_id) REFERENCES Entities(entity_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (attribute_id) REFERENCES Attributes(attribute_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Date_Values (
    entity_id INT,
    attribute_id INT,
    value DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (entity_id) REFERENCES Entities(entity_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (attribute_id) REFERENCES Attributes(attribute_id)
);
```

### Advantages

1. **Optimized Performance**: Queries can be faster since data is stored in well-structured tables by type.
2. **Data Integrity and Validation**: Separate tables or columns allow for more straightforward application of constraints and type validation.
3. **Scalability**: More effective use of indexing and storage, reducing overhead associated with handling multiple data types in a single column.

### Disadvantages

1. **Increased Complexity**: Requires additional tables and joins, which can complicate both querying and schema management.
2. **Overhead on Data Manipulation**: Insertions, updates, and deletions may require interaction with multiple tables.
3. **Schema Evolution**: Changes in attribute types or addition of new types may necessitate schema adjustments.

## Related Design Patterns

- **Polymorphic Associations**: Similar to EAV but often involves linking entities across different table structures, emphasizing relationships over attribute value separations.
- **Flexible Schema Design**: A broader category of which EAV patterns, including Value-Type Separation, are a subset.

## Summary

The Value-Type Separation pattern enhances the traditional EAV approach by effectively partitioning different data types across separate storage containers. Through this strategy, systems can handle dynamic, polymorphic attributes efficiently while maintaining clarity and performance in data retrieval and manipulation, making it ideal for highly-variable datasets common in product and medical records databases.
