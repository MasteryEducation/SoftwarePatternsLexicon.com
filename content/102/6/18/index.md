## Overview

The Versioned Attributes pattern is a method to track changes in entities' attributes over time. This approach is essential in scenarios where historical data is important, such as auditing, compliance, and data analysis. By adding versioning capabilities to the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model, it enhances its utility for cases where history and auditability are crucial.

## Design Pattern Category

This pattern falls under Temporal Modeling, which deals with managing time-related aspects of data. Specifically, it sits within the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) Patterns, focusing on how to model attributes that can have multiple versions over time.

## Architectural Approach

### Structure

This design pattern involves structuring your database tables in a way that each attribute of an entity can have multiple records tied to it, each with its own validity period. A common approach is to add fields such as `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` to the EAV model. This allows for querying the state of an entity's attributes at any point in time.

### Implementation

Using SQL as an example, consider the following schema modification:

```sql
CREATE TABLE AttributeVersions (
    EntityID INT,
    AttributeName VARCHAR(255),
    AttributeValue VARCHAR(255),
    ValidFrom DATETIME,
    ValidTo DATETIME,
    PRIMARY KEY (EntityID, AttributeName, ValidFrom)
);
```

Each entry within `AttributeVersions` records the value of `AttributeName` for a specific period.

### Querying

To find the value of an attribute for a specific date, you would execute a query similar to this:

```sql
SELECT AttributeValue
FROM AttributeVersions
WHERE EntityID = :entityId
  AND AttributeName = :attributeName
  AND :specificDate BETWEEN ValidFrom AND ValidTo;
```

## Best Practices

- **Indexing**: Ensure that `EntityID`, `AttributeName`, and time fields are well-indexed for efficient querying.
- **Boundaries**: Always ensure `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` are correctly managed to avoid overlapping periods.
- **Archival**: Consider data archival strategies to manage the size of the versioned attributes table over time.

## Example Code

### Java Example

A hypothetical Java implementation for handling versioned attributes could look like this:

```java
public class VersionedAttribute {
    private final int entityId;
    private final String attributeName;
    private final String attributeValue;
    private final LocalDateTime validFrom;
    private final LocalDateTime validTo;

    // Constructor and Getters
    public VersionedAttribute(int entityId, String attributeName, String attributeValue, LocalDateTime validFrom, LocalDateTime validTo) {
        this.entityId = entityId;
        this.attributeName = attributeName;
        this.attributeValue = attributeValue;
        this.validFrom = validFrom;
        this.validTo = validTo;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

## Related Patterns

- **Temporal Tables**: A similar pattern that involves maintaining temporal states directly within the relational schema.
- **Audit Trail**: Used to keep a record of changes or historical versions of entire records, often at a higher granularity than individual attributes.

## Summary

The Versioned Attributes pattern is instrumental in domains where understanding the history and evolution of data is necessary. By embedding temporal metadata directly into the EAV model, this pattern supports complex queries related to past states, addressing both accuracy and compliance concerns. By following best practices and exploring related patterns, you can implement efficient and scalable solutions to manage temporal data effectively.
