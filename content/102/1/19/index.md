## Composite Index

### Description

A composite index is a database index that includes more than one column in a relational database. The main objective of using a composite index is to improve the performance of searches that need to efficiently filter and sort on multiple columns. Unlike single-column indexes, composite indexes can be beneficial for queries that involve any combination of the indexed columns.

When a composite index is implemented wisely, it can significantly reduce data retrieval times for multi-column queries which would otherwise require a full table scan. This design pattern is prevalent in performance tuning because it balances between over-indexing, which can slow updates, and under-indexing, which can slow queries.

### Motivation

Creating a composite index helps in:
- Optimizing search queries that filter on more than one column.
- Optimizing JOIN operations by indexing columns used in matching.
- Ensuring efficient sorting and optimizing order-by queries that match the sequence of the index.

### Application

To effectively use composite indexes:
- Evaluate query patterns to identify columns often used together.
- Limit the number of columns in a composite index because a wider index can cause increased IO and index maintenance costs.
- Beware of the order of columns in a composite index, as it influences which queries will benefit. The left-most prefix rule implies that the composite index can be used if the query filters on the initial subset of columns in the index.

### Example

Creating a composite index on the "Employees" table that involves both "LastName" and "FirstName":

```sql
CREATE INDEX IDX_EmployeeNames 
ON Employees (LastName, FirstName);
```

### Considerations

- **Column Order**: Select the most selective column first. If "LastName" typically provides more variability than "FirstName", it should be ordered first.
- **Data Modification**: Be aware that composite indexes can increase the time for insert, update, and delete operations because all indexed columns need to be maintained.
- **Database Growth**: The benefits must be weighed against increased index size and lock contention.

### Related Patterns

- **Single Index Pattern**: Single-column based indexing, useful when queries target individual columns frequently.
- **Covering Index Pattern**: Combines indexed columns with non-key attributes in an index, allowing queries to be fulfilled without accessing table rows.

### Summary

Composite indexes are a sophisticated mechanism for boosting the performance of complex queries in relational databases. They serve as a critical performance optimization tool, especially for queries requiring multicolumn filtering and sorting. To maximize their benefits, careful indexing strategy and understanding of query patterns are necessary, ensuring the right balance between read performance and write costs.
