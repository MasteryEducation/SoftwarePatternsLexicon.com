## Introduction

The Pre-Joining Tables design pattern focuses on enhancing read performance by merging related tables into one comprehensive table. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where access speed is more crucial than storage efficiency, such as in reporting databases or data warehousing. This pattern aligns with the principles of denormalization, where data redundancy is intentionally increased to improve query responsiveness.

## Architectural Approach

In typical normalized databases, data is split across multiple tables, connected via foreign keys to minimize redundancy and maintain integrity. However, this can complicate queries and degrade performance due to the overhead of executing multiple joins. The **Pre-Joining Tables** pattern counters this by combining data from separate tables into one denormalized structure.

### Benefits

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces the number of table joins required during query execution, which can significantly speed up data retrieval.
- **Simplifying Queries**: Complex queries become simpler and more readable as they target a single table instead of traversing multiple tables.
- **Improved Caching**: Single table data structures increase cache efficiency, reducing the time to fetch frequently accessed data.

### Drawbacks

- **Increased Redundancy**: Introduces data redundancy, leading to increased storage requirements and potential anomalies with data updates.
- **Complexity in Maintenance**: Requires additional logic to keep the pre-joined tables in sync with their normalized counterparts, especially if there are frequent updates.

## Best Practices

1. **Use in Read-Intensive Contexts**: This pattern is best suited for systems with high read-to-write ratios, where the overhead of joins would otherwise become a bottleneck.
2. **Automate Synchronization**: Develop automated processes to continually synchronize pre-joined tables with their source tables to maintain accurate data representation.
3. **Monitor Storage Costs**: Balance the trade-offs between improved performance and increased storage costs, adjusting the pattern's application accordingly.

## Example Code

Here's a SQL example demonstrating how to create a pre-joined table from "Order" and "OrderDetails":

```sql
CREATE TABLE PreJoinedOrders AS
SELECT 
    o.OrderID,
    o.CustomerID,
    od.ProductID,
    od.Quantity,
    od.Price
FROM 
    Orders o
JOIN 
    OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID;
```

This query generates a new table `PreJoinedOrders` optimized for read-heavy queries commonly found in reporting environments.

## Related Patterns

- **Materialized Views**: Similar in purpose, materialized views store the results of a query physically and can improve performance through caching and pre-calculation.
- **Projection Table Pattern**: Involves creating specialized tables that provide a subset of fields for fast access pertaining to specific use cases.

## Summary

The Pre-Joining Tables design pattern serves as a strategic compromise in data modeling between the complexities of normalized forms and the need for efficient read operations. By merging related tables into fewer, larger tables, it allows for fast query execution at the cost of increased redundancy. This pattern is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the speed of data retrieval outweighs the traditional costs of data duplication, such as in OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems and reporting databases.
