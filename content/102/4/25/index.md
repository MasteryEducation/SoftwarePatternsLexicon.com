## Overview

Segmented Time-Series Analysis is a design pattern that focuses on partitioning time-series data into specific segments based on predefined events, conditions, or triggers. This approach allows for more detailed and insightful analysis by isolating data relevant to particular scenarios, providing context-sensitive insights that might be obscured in aggregate views.

## Explanation

Time-series data exhibits continuous flows of data points indexed in time order. This dataset often spans various underlying states or situations which influence the data characteristics. The Segmented Time-Series Analysis pattern aims to group the data by meaningful periods, enabling tailored analysis for each segment. 

### Application Scenarios

1. **Network Traffic Analysis**: By segmenting data based on peak and off-peak hours, analysts gain clearer insights into typical usage patterns, congestion causes, and potential infrastructural needs.

2. **Financial Markets**: Segments based on economic calendar events or trading sessions can lead to more precise strategies by understanding behavior during specific times.

3. **IoT Sensor Readings**: Sensor data segmented by environmental changes can lead to better predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.

## Architectural Approaches

Implementing Segmented Time-Series Analysis can involve several approaches, depending on the complexity and scale of the data:

### Time Window Segmentation

- **Fixed Windows**: Data is divided into uniform time intervals, such as hourly or daily segments.
  
- **Sliding Windows**: Overlapping segments allow for continuous data assessment with a defined stride or step between them.

### Event-Based Segmentation

- Segments are created based on occurrences of specific events. This is particularly useful in application monitoring or incident investigation.

### Condition-Based Segmentation

- Data is divided based on specific thresholds or conditions. For example, segmenting temperature data when it exceeds a certain value.

## Example Code

Example in Scala using Spark for rolling and event-based time series segmentation:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window

val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SegmentedTimeSeriesAnalysis").getOrCreate()
import spark.implicits._

val data = Seq(
  ("2024-01-01 00:00:00", 100),
  ("2024-01-01 01:00:00", 200),
  // Add more data points here...
).toDF("timestamp", "value")

val eventWindow = Window.orderBy("timestamp").rangeBetween(-3600, 3600)
val segmentedData = data
  .withColumn("rolling_avg", avg("value").over(eventWindow))
  .withColumn("segment", when($"value" > 150, "High").otherwise("Low"))

segmentedData.show()
```

## Related Patterns

- **Event Sourcing**: Captures event-based triggers for changing data state over time.
- **Snapshot Isolation**: Isolates data states to minimize interference, relevant in creating consistent temporal segments.
- **Streaming Analytics**: Applies real-time processing and segmentation for dynamic systems requiring immediate insights.

## Summary

Segmented Time-Series Analysis empowers data scientists and engineers to derive detailed insights by segmenting continuous data into meaningful parts. By leveraging fixed, event-based, or condition-based segmentation, one can focus analysis based on temporal context and underlying factors unique to each segment. This pattern serves as a pivotal tool for refined time-series analysis and results monitoring, vital in domains ranging from finance to IoT.
