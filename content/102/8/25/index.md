## Description

Graph traversal algorithms are essential techniques utilized to explore and analyze graph structures in data modeling, particularly when dealing with hierarchical or network models. These algorithms are fundamental in solving various computational problems such as finding paths, searching for connectivity, and discovering cycles.

Two popular graph traversal approaches are:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backing up. DFS is useful for tasks like detecting cycles in a graph or solving puzzles with backtracking challenges.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A strategy that explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is often used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
  
Graph traversal is critical in various application domains, including social networks analysis, geographic navigation systems, and resource optimization in distributed networks.

## Example

Consider using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path in a maze represented as an unweighted graph:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MazeSolver {
    private static class Point {
        int x, y;
        Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    public static List<Point> bfs(int[][] maze, Point start, Point end) {
        Queue<Point> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(start);

        Map<Point, Point> parentMap = new HashMap<>();
        parentMap.put(start, null);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Point current = queue.poll();
            if (current.x == end.x && current.y == end.y) break;

            for (Point neighbor : getNeighbors(maze, current)) {
                if (!parentMap.containsKey(neighbor)) {
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                    parentMap.put(neighbor, current);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return reconstructPath(parentMap, end);
    }

    private static List<Point> reconstructPath(Map<Point, Point> parentMap, Point end) {
        List<Point> path = new LinkedList<>();
        for (Point at = end; at != null; at = parentMap.get(at))
            path.add(at);
        Collections.reverse(path);
        return path;
    }
    
    private static List<Point> getNeighbors(int[][] maze, Point point) {
        int[] dx = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
        int[] dy = {0, 0, -1, 1};

        List<Point> neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nx = point.x + dx[i];
            int ny = point.y + dy[i];
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < maze.length && ny >= 0 && ny < maze[0].length && maze[nx][ny] == 0) {
                neighbors.add(new Point(nx, ny));
            }
        }
        return neighbors;
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates a BFS implementation that finds the shortest path in a grid when given start and end points. The `bfs()` function uses a queue to explore level-by-level while a map tracks the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.
