## 13.4.3 Functional Interfaces and Patterns

In the realm of modern Java development, functional programming has emerged as a powerful paradigm that complements object-oriented programming. This section delves into the concept of functional interfaces and their application in implementing design patterns, demonstrating how they can simplify code, reduce boilerplate, and enhance expressiveness.

### Understanding Functional Interfaces

Functional interfaces are a cornerstone of functional programming in Java. They are interfaces with a single abstract method (SAM), which makes them ideal for lambda expressions and method references. The introduction of functional interfaces in Java 8 marked a significant shift towards functional programming, allowing developers to write more concise and readable code.

#### Key Functional Interfaces

Java provides several built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Predicate<T>**: Represents a boolean-valued function of one argument. It is often used for filtering or conditional checks.

  ```java
  Predicate<String> isLongerThanFive = s -> s.length() > 5;
  ```

- **Function<T, R>**: Represents a function that takes an argument of type T and returns a result of type R. It is useful for transforming data.

  ```java
  Function<String, Integer> stringLength = String::length;
  ```

- **Consumer<T>**: Represents an operation that takes a single input argument and returns no result. It is typically used for performing actions.

  ```java
  Consumer<String> print = System.out::println;
  ```

- **Supplier<T>**: Represents a supplier of results, providing a way to generate or supply values without taking any input.

  ```java
  Supplier<Double> randomValue = Math::random;
  ```

- **BiFunction<T, U, R>**: Similar to `Function`, but takes two arguments.

  ```java
  BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> add = (a, b) -> a + b;
  ```

These interfaces enable higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This capability is crucial for implementing various design patterns in a functional style.

### Implementing Design Patterns with Functional Interfaces

Functional programming can simplify the implementation of several design patterns by reducing boilerplate code and enhancing code readability. Let's explore how functional interfaces can be utilized to implement some common design patterns.

#### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. Traditionally, this pattern involves creating a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.

##### Traditional Implementation

In a traditional object-oriented approach, the Strategy Pattern requires creating an interface for the strategy and multiple classes implementing this interface.

```java
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

class CreditCardStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

class ShoppingCart {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

##### Functional Implementation

With functional interfaces, we can use lambdas to define strategies, eliminating the need for concrete strategy classes.

```java
import java.util.function.Consumer;

class ShoppingCart {
    private Consumer<Integer> paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(Consumer<Integer> paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.accept(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
cart.setPaymentStrategy(amount -> System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card."));
cart.checkout(100);

cart.setPaymentStrategy(amount -> System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal."));
cart.checkout(200);
```

In this functional approach, we use `Consumer<Integer>` to represent the payment strategy, allowing us to pass different behaviors as lambda expressions. This results in more concise and flexible code.

#### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

##### Traditional Implementation

Traditionally, the Command Pattern involves creating a command interface and multiple command classes implementing this interface.

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.on();
    }
}

class Light {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Light is on");
    }
}

class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

##### Functional Implementation

Using functional interfaces, we can represent commands as functions, simplifying the implementation.

```java
import java.util.function.Supplier;

class RemoteControl {
    private Supplier<Void> command;

    public void setCommand(Supplier<Void> command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.get();
    }
}

// Usage
Light light = new Light();
RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();
remote.setCommand(() -> {
    light.on();
    return null;
});
remote.pressButton();
```

In this implementation, we use `Supplier<Void>` to represent the command, allowing us to define the command logic inline using a lambda expression.

#### Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

##### Traditional Implementation

In a traditional implementation, the Observer Pattern involves creating a subject interface and observer interface, along with concrete implementations.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    private String name;

    public ConcreteObserver(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received: " + message);
    }
}

class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}
```

##### Functional Implementation

With functional interfaces, we can use `Consumer<String>` to represent observers, simplifying the pattern.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

class Subject {
    private List<Consumer<String>> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addObserver(Consumer<String> observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        observers.forEach(observer -> observer.accept(message));
    }
}

// Usage
Subject subject = new Subject();
subject.addObserver(message -> System.out.println("Observer 1 received: " + message));
subject.addObserver(message -> System.out.println("Observer 2 received: " + message));
subject.notifyObservers("Hello, Observers!");
```

In this functional approach, we use `Consumer<String>` to represent observers, allowing us to define observer behavior inline using lambda expressions.

### Benefits of Functional Programming in Design Patterns

Functional programming offers several advantages when implementing design patterns:

- **Conciseness**: Functional interfaces and lambda expressions reduce the need for boilerplate code, resulting in more concise implementations.
- **Expressiveness**: Functional programming allows for more expressive code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Flexibility**: Higher-order functions enable dynamic behavior changes at runtime, enhancing flexibility.
- **Immutability**: Functional programming encourages immutability, leading to safer and more predictable code.

### Visualizing Functional Interfaces in Design Patterns

To better understand how functional interfaces integrate into design patterns, let's visualize the transformation of a traditional Strategy Pattern into a functional one.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +pay(int amount)
    }
    class CreditCardStrategy {
        +pay(int amount)
    }
    class PayPalStrategy {
        +pay(int amount)
    }
    class ShoppingCart {
        +setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy)
        +checkout(int amount)
    }
    PaymentStrategy <|-- CreditCardStrategy
    PaymentStrategy <|-- PayPalStrategy
    ShoppingCart --> PaymentStrategy

    class ShoppingCartFunctional {
        +setPaymentStrategy(Consumer~Integer~ strategy)
        +checkout(int amount)
    }
    ShoppingCartFunctional --> Consumer~Integer~
```

In this diagram, we see the transition from a traditional class-based strategy implementation to a functional one using `Consumer<Integer>`. The functional approach eliminates the need for concrete strategy classes, simplifying the design.
