```java
public class Order {
    private String orderId;
    private Instrument instrument;
    private BigDecimal quantity;
    private OrderStatus status;

    public Order(String orderId, Instrument instrument, BigDecimal quantity) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.instrument = instrument;
        this.quantity = quantity;
        this.status = OrderStatus.NEW;
    }

    public void execute() {
        if (status != OrderStatus.NEW) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Order cannot be executed");
        }
        // Business logic for order execution
        this.status = OrderStatus.EXECUTED;
    }
}
```

**Domain Events**: Events such as `OrderPlaced` and `TradeExecuted` were used to decouple components and facilitate asynchronous processing.

```java
public class OrderPlacedEvent {
    private final String orderId;
    private final Instant timestamp;

    public OrderPlacedEvent(String orderId) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.timestamp = Instant.now();
    }

    // Getters and other methods
}
```

    private List<Appointment> appointments;

    public Patient(String patientId, String name, LocalDate dateOfBirth) {
        this.patientId = patientId;
        this.name = name;
        this.dateOfBirth = dateOfBirth;
        this.appointments = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void scheduleAppointment(Appointment appointment) {
        // Business logic for scheduling an appointment
        appointments.add(appointment);
    }
}
```

**Domain Events**: Events such as `PatientRegistered` and `AppointmentScheduled` facilitated integration with external systems and services.

```java
public class PatientRegisteredEvent {
    private final String patientId;
    private final Instant timestamp;

    public PatientRegisteredEvent(String patientId) {
        this.patientId = patientId;
        this.timestamp = Instant.now();
