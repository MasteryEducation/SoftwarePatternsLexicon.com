## 13.2.1 Custom Annotations

In the realm of Java programming, annotations serve as a powerful tool for adding metadata to your code. This metadata can be processed at compile-time or runtime to implement custom behaviors, enforce code standards, or simply provide additional information. In this section, we will delve into the creation and utilization of custom annotations, exploring their syntax, application, and practical use cases.

### Understanding Custom Annotations

Annotations in Java are a form of syntactic metadata that can be added to Java code elements such as classes, methods, fields, and more. They are not part of the program itself but can be used by the compiler or at runtime to perform certain operations. Custom annotations allow developers to define their own annotations, tailored to specific needs or frameworks.

#### Why Use Custom Annotations?

Custom annotations can be incredibly useful for a variety of reasons:

- **Code Clarity**: They provide a clear and concise way to convey additional information about code elements.
- **Automation**: Annotations can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as logging or validation.
- **Configuration**: They can serve as a configuration mechanism, reducing the need for external configuration files.
- **Enforcement**: Annotations can enforce coding standards or design patterns by integrating with tools that process them.

### Creating a Custom Annotation

Creating a custom annotation in Java involves several key steps. Let's explore these steps in detail.

#### Step 1: Define the Annotation Using `@interface`

To create a custom annotation, you use the `@interface` keyword. This defines a new annotation type.

```java
// Define a custom annotation
public @interface MyCustomAnnotation {
    // Annotation elements
}
```

#### Step 2: Add Annotation Elements (Parameters)

Annotations can have elements, which are essentially parameters. These elements can have default values.

```java
// Define a custom annotation with elements
public @interface MyCustomAnnotation {
    String value() default "default value";
    int number() default 0;
}
```

#### Step 3: Specify Retention Policies

Retention policies determine at what point the annotation is discarded. Java provides three retention policies:

- `SOURCE`: The annotation is retained only in the source code and discarded during compilation.
- `CLASS`: The annotation is retained in the class file but not available at runtime.
- `RUNTIME`: The annotation is retained at runtime and can be accessed via reflection.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;

// Define a custom annotation with a retention policy
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface MyCustomAnnotation {
    String value() default "default value";
}
```

#### Step 4: Define Target Elements

Target elements specify where the annotation can be applied. Common targets include:

- `TYPE`: Classes, interfaces, or enums.
- `FIELD`: Fields (including enum constants).
- `METHOD`: Methods.
- `PARAMETER`: Parameters of a method.
- `CONSTRUCTOR`: Constructors.
- `LOCAL_VARIABLE`: Local variables.
- `ANNOTATION_TYPE`: Annotations.
- `PACKAGE`: Packages.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

// Define a custom annotation with a target
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface MyCustomAnnotation {
    String value() default "default value";
}
```

### Applying Custom Annotations

Once you've defined a custom annotation, you can apply it to various code elements. Let's look at some examples.

#### Applying to a Class

```java
@MyCustomAnnotation(value = "Class Level Annotation")
public class MyClass {
    // Class implementation
}
```

#### Applying to a Method

```java
public class MyClass {

    @MyCustomAnnotation(value = "Method Level Annotation")
    public void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

#### Applying to a Field

```java
public class MyClass {

    @MyCustomAnnotation(value = "Field Level Annotation")
    private String myField;

    // Class implementation
}
```

### Use Cases for Custom Annotations

Custom annotations can be used in a variety of scenarios. Here are some common use cases:

#### Marking Methods for Logging or Auditing

Annotations can be used to mark methods that require logging or auditing. A logging framework can then process these annotations to automatically log method calls.

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Loggable {
    String level() default "INFO";
}
```

#### Specifying Configuration Parameters

Annotations can serve as a configuration mechanism, allowing you to specify configuration parameters directly in your code.

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.FIELD)
public @interface ConfigParam {
    String key();
    String defaultValue() default "";
}
```

#### Enforcing Coding Conventions

Annotations can be used to enforce coding conventions or design patterns. For example, you might create an annotation to ensure that certain methods are only called in specific contexts.

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface RequiresAuthentication {
    // No elements needed
}
```

### Best Practices for Custom Annotations

When creating custom annotations, consider the following best practices:

- **Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for your annotations. Consider using a prefix or suffix to avoid conflicts with other annotations.
- **Documentation**: Provide documentation for your annotations, explaining their purpose and usage.
- **Retention and Target**: Carefully choose the retention policy and target elements to match the intended use of the annotation.
- **Default Values**: Provide default values for annotation elements where appropriate to simplify usage.

### Code Example: Creating and Using a Custom Annotation

Let's put everything together with a comprehensive example. We'll create a custom annotation for logging method execution times.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

// Define the custom annotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface LogExecutionTime {
    // No elements needed
}

// A class using the custom annotation
public class PerformanceTester {

    @LogExecutionTime
    public void performTask() {
        // Simulate task execution
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

To process this annotation, you would typically use reflection. Here's a simple example of how you might do that:

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class AnnotationProcessor {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        PerformanceTester tester = new PerformanceTester();
        Method method = tester.getClass().getMethod("performTask");

        if (method.isAnnotationPresent(LogExecutionTime.class)) {
            long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            method.invoke(tester);
            long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + "ms");
        }
    }
}
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code above by modifying the `LogExecutionTime` annotation to include a `String` element for specifying a custom log message. Update the `AnnotationProcessor` to print this message before logging the execution time.

### Visualizing Annotation Processing

To better understand how annotations are processed, let's visualize the flow of annotation processing using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid

    participant Developer
    participant Code
    participant Compiler
    participant Runtime

    Developer->>Code: Define Custom Annotation
    Developer->>Code: Apply Annotation
    Code->>Compiler: Compile Code
    Compiler->>Runtime: Load Class
    Runtime->>AnnotationProcessor: Process Annotation

```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a custom annotation from definition and application by the developer, through compilation and runtime processing, to execution by an annotation processor.
