## 10.8 Leveraging New Java Features in Design Patterns

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, staying updated with the latest language features is crucial for writing efficient, maintainable, and modern code. Java, a language that has been around for decades, continues to evolve, offering new features that can significantly enhance the way we implement design patterns. In this section, we'll explore how recent enhancements in Java can be leveraged to modernize traditional design patterns, making them more concise and expressive.

### Recent Java Enhancements

Java has introduced several powerful features in its recent versions, such as records, sealed classes, and pattern matching. These features not only simplify code but also enhance its readability and maintainability. Let's delve into these features and understand how they can be applied to design patterns.

#### Records

Records, introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and made stable in Java 16, provide a compact syntax for declaring classes that are primarily used to store data. They automatically generate boilerplate code such as constructors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

```java
// Traditional Java class for a Point
public class Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getX() { return x; }
    public int getY() { return y; }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) { /* implementation */ }
    @Override
    public int hashCode() { /* implementation */ }
    @Override
    public String toString() { /* implementation */ }
}

// Modern Java Record
public record Point(int x, int y) {}
```

#### Sealed Classes

Sealed classes, introduced in Java 15 as a preview feature and finalized in Java 17, allow you to control which classes can extend a particular class. This feature is useful for defining a fixed set of subclasses, enhancing the safety and clarity of your code.

```java
// Sealed class example
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}

public final class Circle extends Shape { /* implementation */ }
public final class Rectangle extends Shape { /* implementation */ }
```

#### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching, introduced in Java 16 for `instanceof` and expanded in later versions, simplifies the code by eliminating the need for explicit casting and enhancing the readability of conditional logic.

```java
// Traditional instanceof check
if (obj instanceof String) {
    String str = (String) obj;
    System.out.println(str.length());
}

// Pattern matching for instanceof
if (obj instanceof String str) {
    System.out.println(str.length());
}
```

### Modernizing Patterns

Let's explore how these new features can be applied to modernize traditional design patterns, making them more elegant and concise.

#### Singleton Pattern with Records

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. With records, we can simplify the implementation by leveraging their immutability and built-in methods.

```java
// Traditional Singleton
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

// Modern Singleton using Record
public record Singleton() {
    private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

#### Factory Pattern with Sealed Classes

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Sealed classes can be used to define a fixed set of product types, ensuring type safety and clarity.

```java
// Traditional Factory
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Circle"); }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle"); }
}

class ShapeFactory {
    public static Shape createShape(String type) {
        return switch (type) {
            case "Circle" -> new Circle();
            case "Rectangle" -> new Rectangle();
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown shape type");
        };
    }
}

// Modern Factory with Sealed Classes
public sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {
    void draw();
}

public final class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Circle"); }
}

public final class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle"); }
}

class ShapeFactory {
    public static Shape createShape(String type) {
        return switch (type) {
            case "Circle" -> new Circle();
            case "Rectangle" -> new Rectangle();
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown shape type");
        };
    }
}
```

#### Visitor Pattern with Pattern Matching

The Visitor pattern is used to separate an algorithm from the objects on which it operates. Pattern matching can simplify the implementation by reducing boilerplate code associated with type checking and casting.

```java
// Traditional Visitor
interface Visitor {
    void visit(Circle circle);
    void visit(Rectangle rectangle);
}

class ShapeVisitor implements Visitor {
    public void visit(Circle circle) { /* implementation */ }
    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) { /* implementation */ }
}

interface Shape {
    void accept(Visitor visitor);
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); }
}

// Modern Visitor with Pattern Matching
interface Shape {
    void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor);
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); }
}

class ShapeVisitor {
    public void visit(Shape shape) {
        if (shape instanceof Circle circle) {
            // Handle Circle
        } else if (shape instanceof Rectangle rectangle) {
            // Handle Rectangle
        }
    }
}
```

### Code Modernization Examples

Let's look at some before-and-after code snippets to see how these new features can improve code clarity and conciseness.

#### Example 1: Data Transfer Object (DTO)

**Before:**

```java
public class UserDTO {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public UserDTO(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public int getAge() { return age; }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) { /* implementation */ }
    @Override
    public int hashCode() { /* implementation */ }
    @Override
    public String toString() { /* implementation */ }
}
```

**After:**

```java
public record UserDTO(String name, int age) {}
```

#### Example 2: Command Pattern

**Before:**

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.on();
    }
}
```

**After:**

```java
record LightOnCommand(Light light) implements Command {
    public void execute() {
        light.on();
    }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

While adopting new Java features can greatly enhance your code, it's important to consider backward compatibility, especially if your project needs to support older Java versions. Here are some strategies to manage this:

- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to conditionally enable new features based on the Java version.
- **Gradual Adoption**: Introduce new features incrementally, ensuring that critical parts of your application remain stable.
- **Compatibility Libraries**: Utilize libraries that backport newer features to older Java versions.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your application across different Java versions to ensure compatibility and stability.

### Encouraging Adaptability

In the fast-paced world of software development, continuous learning is essential. Staying updated with the latest language features and best practices can significantly enhance your skills and career prospects. Here are some tips to stay current:
