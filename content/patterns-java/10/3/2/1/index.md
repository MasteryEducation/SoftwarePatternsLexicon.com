## 10.3.2.1 ReentrantLock

### Introduction to ReentrantLock

In the realm of Java concurrency, managing access to shared resources is crucial to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions. While the `synchronized` keyword provides a basic mechanism for achieving mutual exclusion, it lacks flexibility and advanced features. Enter `ReentrantLock`, a part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package, which offers a more sophisticated and flexible locking mechanism.

### What is ReentrantLock?

`ReentrantLock` is a reentrant mutual exclusion lock with the same basic behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using `synchronized` methods and statements, but with extended capabilities. It allows more control over the locking process, including the ability to interrupt lock acquisition, attempt to acquire the lock without blocking, and specify a fairness policy.

#### Advantages of ReentrantLock over Synchronized

1. **Fairness Policy**: Unlike `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock` can be configured to follow a fairness policy, ensuring that the longest-waiting thread is granted access to the lock first. This can prevent thread starvation in highly contended environments.

2. **Interruptible Lock Acquisition**: Threads attempting to acquire a `ReentrantLock` can be interrupted, allowing for more responsive applications. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a thread should not remain blocked indefinitely.

3. **Try-Lock Mechanism**: `ReentrantLock` provides a non-blocking attempt to acquire the lock using the `tryLock()` method, which can return immediately if the lock is not available, thus avoiding potential deadlocks.

4. **Lock Status Inquiry**: It allows querying the lock status, such as checking if the lock is held by any thread or by the current thread, using methods like `isLocked()` and `isHeldByCurrentThread()`.

5. **Condition Variables**: `ReentrantLock` supports multiple condition variables, allowing threads to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding, which is more flexible than the single wait set per object with `synchronized`.

### Using ReentrantLock in Java

To effectively utilize `ReentrantLock`, it is essential to understand its API and best practices. Below are examples demonstrating its usage.

#### Basic Usage Example

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Counter {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Always release the lock in a finally block
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the `increment()` and `getCount()` methods are protected by a `ReentrantLock`. The lock is acquired before modifying or accessing the shared resource (`count`), and it is released in a `finally` block to ensure it is always released, preventing potential deadlocks.

#### Fairness Policy

```java
ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Fair lock
```

**Explanation**: By passing `true` to the `ReentrantLock` constructor, a fairness policy is enforced, ensuring that threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it.

#### Interruptible Lock Acquisition

```java
public void performTask() {
    try {
        if (lock.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) { // Attempt to acquire lock with timeout
            try {
                // Perform task
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        } else {
            // Handle the case where the lock was not acquired
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Handle interruption
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` method allows a thread to attempt to acquire the lock within a specified time frame, and it can be interrupted if necessary.

### Best Practices for Using ReentrantLock

1. **Always Release the Lock**: Ensure that the lock is released in a `finally` block to prevent deadlocks, even if an exception occurs within the critical section.

2. **Use Fairness Judiciously**: While fairness can prevent starvation, it may reduce throughput. Use it only when necessary.

3. **Avoid Holding Locks for Long Periods**: Minimize the time a lock is held to improve concurrency and reduce contention.

4. **Consider Lock-Free Alternatives**: For some scenarios, lock-free data structures or algorithms may offer better performance and scalability.

### Use Cases for ReentrantLock

1. **Complex Synchronization Requirements**: When multiple condition variables are needed, `ReentrantLock` provides more flexibility than `synchronized`.

2. **Highly Contended Resources**: In scenarios where thread starvation is a concern, the fairness policy of `ReentrantLock` can be beneficial.

3. **Interruptible Tasks**: For tasks that should not be blocked indefinitely, `ReentrantLock`'s interruptible lock acquisition is advantageous.

### Conclusion

`ReentrantLock` is a powerful tool in the Java concurrency toolkit, offering advanced features and flexibility beyond what `synchronized` provides. By understanding its capabilities and adhering to best practices, developers can effectively manage concurrency in complex applications, ensuring thread safety and improving performance.
