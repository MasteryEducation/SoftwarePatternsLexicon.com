## 1.5 Overview of Java's Features Relevant to Design Patterns

Java, as a robust and versatile programming language, provides a rich set of features that are instrumental in implementing design patterns effectively. This section delves into these features, illustrating how they support and enhance the use of design patterns. By understanding these features, experienced Java developers and software architects can leverage them to create more efficient, maintainable, and scalable applications.

### Key Java Features for Design Patterns

#### Interfaces

**Description**: Interfaces in Java define a contract that classes can implement. They are crucial for defining the roles and behaviors that classes must adhere to, making them a cornerstone for many design patterns.

**Support for Design Patterns**: Interfaces are fundamental in patterns like Strategy, Observer, and Command, where they define the expected behavior without dictating the implementation.

**Code Example**: Strategy Pattern using Interfaces

```java
// Strategy interface
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

// Concrete strategy for credit card payment
class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

// Concrete strategy for PayPal payment
class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

// Context class
class ShoppingCart {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
public class StrategyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
        cart.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());
        cart.checkout(100);

        cart.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
        cart.checkout(200);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the `PaymentStrategy` interface defines a method `pay`, which is implemented by `CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment`. The `ShoppingCart` class uses these strategies interchangeably, demonstrating the flexibility provided by interfaces.

#### Abstract Classes

**Description**: Abstract classes allow for the definition of methods that can be shared among subclasses while also providing a mechanism for enforcing certain methods to be implemented by subclasses.

**Support for Design Patterns**: Abstract classes are often used in the Template Method pattern, where they define the skeleton of an algorithm and let subclasses fill in the details.

**Code Example**: Template Method Pattern using Abstract Classes

```java
// Abstract class with template method
abstract class DataProcessor {
    // Template method
    public final void process() {
        readData();
        processData();
        writeData();
    }

    abstract void readData();
    abstract void processData();
    abstract void writeData();
}

// Concrete class implementing the abstract methods
class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data from CSV file.");
    }

    @Override
    void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing CSV data.");
    }

    @Override
    void writeData() {
        System.out.println("Writing data to CSV file.");
    }
}

// Usage
public class TemplateMethodPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataProcessor processor = new CSVDataProcessor();
        processor.process();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `DataProcessor` abstract class defines a template method `process` that outlines the steps of data processing. The `CSVDataProcessor` class provides specific implementations for these steps, showcasing the power of abstract classes in enforcing a structure while allowing flexibility.

#### Generics

**Description**: Generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. This feature provides type safety and reduces the need for type casting.

**Support for Design Patterns**: Generics are particularly useful in patterns like Factory and Observer, where they allow for more flexible and type-safe implementations.

**Code Example**: Factory Pattern with Generics

```java
// Generic factory interface
interface Factory<T> {
    T create();
}

// Concrete factory for creating Integer objects
class IntegerFactory implements Factory<Integer> {
    @Override
    public Integer create() {
        return new Integer(0);
    }
}

// Concrete factory for creating String objects
class StringFactory implements Factory<String> {
    @Override
    public String create() {
        return new String("Default");
    }
}

// Usage
public class FactoryPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Factory<Integer> integerFactory = new IntegerFactory();
        Integer integer = integerFactory.create();
        System.out.println("Created Integer: " + integer);

        Factory<String> stringFactory = new StringFactory();
        String string = stringFactory.create();
        System.out.println("Created String: " + string);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Factory` interface uses a generic type `T`, allowing for the creation of different types of objects without compromising type safety. This flexibility is a key advantage of using generics in design patterns.

#### Annotations

**Description**: Annotations provide metadata about the program, which can be used by the compiler or at runtime. They are a powerful tool for adding declarative information to Java code.

**Support for Design Patterns**: Annotations are often used in conjunction with patterns like Singleton and Dependency Injection to provide configuration and enforce constraints.

**Code Example**: Singleton Pattern with Annotations

```java
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;

// Custom annotation for Singleton
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface Singleton {
}

// Singleton class using annotation
@Singleton
class DatabaseConnection {
    private static DatabaseConnection instance;

    private DatabaseConnection() {
    }

    public static synchronized DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DatabaseConnection();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

// Usage
public class SingletonPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DatabaseConnection connection1 = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();
        DatabaseConnection connection2 = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();
        System.out.println("Are both connections the same? " + (connection1 == connection2));
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `@Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that `DatabaseConnection` should follow the Singleton pattern. While the annotation itself does not enforce the pattern, it serves as a declarative marker that can be used for documentation or tooling purposes.

#### Lambda Expressions

**Description**: Lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. They are a key feature introduced in Java 8 that enables functional programming.

**Support for Design Patterns**: Lambda expressions simplify the implementation of patterns like Command and Observer by reducing boilerplate code and enhancing readability.

**Code Example**: Observer Pattern with Lambda Expressions

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

// Subject class
class EventSource {
    private final List<Consumer<String>> listeners = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addListener(Consumer<String> listener) {
        listeners.add(listener);
    }

    public void notifyListeners(String event) {
        listeners.forEach(listener -> listener.accept(event));
    }
}

// Usage
public class ObserverPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EventSource eventSource = new EventSource();

        // Adding listeners using lambda expressions
        eventSource.addListener(event -> System.out.println("Listener 1 received: " + event));
        eventSource.addListener(event -> System.out.println("Listener 2 received: " + event));

        eventSource.notifyListeners("Event 1");
        eventSource.notifyListeners("Event 2");
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `EventSource` class uses a `List` of `Consumer<String>` to manage listeners. Lambda expressions are used to add listeners, demonstrating how they can simplify the implementation of the Observer pattern.

#### Modern Java Enhancements

Java has continuously evolved, introducing features that further enhance the implementation of design patterns. Below are some modern enhancements:

##### Java Module System (JPMS)

**Description**: Introduced in Java 9, the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) provides a way to modularize applications, improving encapsulation and reducing the complexity of large systems.

**Support for Design Patterns**: JPMS is particularly relevant for patterns like Facade and Mediator, where it helps in organizing and managing dependencies between modules.

**Code Example**: Using JPMS with Facade Pattern

```java
// module-info.java for a module
module com.example.facade {
    exports com.example.facade;
}

// Facade class in the module
package com.example.facade;

public class SystemFacade {
    public void startSystem() {
        System.out.println("Starting system...");
        // Start subsystems
    }
}

// Usage in another module
module com.example.application {
    requires com.example.facade;
}

package com.example.application;

import com.example.facade.SystemFacade;

public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SystemFacade facade = new SystemFacade();
        facade.startSystem();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `module-info.java` files define the modules and their dependencies. The `SystemFacade` class provides a simplified interface for starting the system, illustrating how JPMS can be used to organize and manage dependencies.

##### Concurrency Utilities

**Description**: Java provides a comprehensive set of concurrency utilities in the `java.util.concurrent` package, which are essential for building concurrent applications.

**Support for Design Patterns**: Concurrency utilities are crucial for patterns like Producer-Consumer and Thread Pool, where they provide thread-safe data structures and synchronization mechanisms.

**Code Example**: Producer-Consumer Pattern with Concurrency Utilities

```java
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

// Producer class
class Producer implements Runnable {
    private final BlockingQueue<Integer> queue;

    public Producer(BlockingQueue<Integer> queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                System.out.println("Producing " + i);
                queue.put(i);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

// Consumer class
class Consumer implements Runnable {
    private final BlockingQueue<Integer> queue;

    public Consumer(BlockingQueue<Integer> queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            while (true) {
                Integer item = queue.take();
                System.out.println("Consuming " + item);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

// Usage
public class ProducerConsumerPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(5);
        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new Producer(queue));
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new Consumer(queue));

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `BlockingQueue` is used to safely pass data between the `Producer` and `Consumer` threads, demonstrating how concurrency utilities can simplify the implementation of concurrent design patterns.
