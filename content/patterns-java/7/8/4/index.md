## 7.8.4 Proxy vs. Decorator Pattern

In the realm of software design patterns, both the Proxy and Decorator patterns are pivotal in structuring object-oriented systems. While they share the commonality of wrapping objects, their purposes and applications diverge significantly. This section delves into these differences, providing a comprehensive understanding of when and how to use each pattern effectively.

### Introduction to Proxy and Decorator Patterns

Both the Proxy and Decorator patterns belong to the structural category of design patterns. They are instrumental in managing object composition and delegation, allowing developers to extend or control the behavior of objects without altering their structure. However, the intent behind each pattern is distinct, which is crucial for selecting the appropriate pattern for a given problem.

### Proxy Pattern Overview

#### Intent

The primary intent of the Proxy pattern is to control access to an object. It acts as an intermediary, providing a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where direct access to an object is either costly or undesirable.

#### Common Use Cases

- **Virtual Proxy**: Delays the creation and initialization of expensive objects until they are actually needed.
- **Remote Proxy**: Represents an object located in a different address space, often used in distributed systems.
- **Protection Proxy**: Controls access to the original object, providing different levels of access rights.

#### Example

Consider a scenario where you have a large image file that needs to be loaded and displayed. Using a Virtual Proxy, you can defer the loading of the image until it is actually required.

```java
interface Image {
    void display();
}

class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading " + filename);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + filename);
    }
}

class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private RealImage realImage;
    private String filename;

    public ProxyImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}

public class ProxyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image = new ProxyImage("test_image.jpg");
        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image.display();
        // Image will not be loaded from disk
        image.display();
    }
}
```

### Decorator Pattern Overview

#### Intent

The Decorator pattern is designed to add new functionality to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Decorators wrap the original object and provide additional behavior.

#### Common Use Cases

- **Enhancing Object Behavior**: Adding responsibilities to individual objects without affecting others.
- **Dynamic Composition**: Allowing behaviors to be added or removed at runtime.

#### Example

Imagine a scenario where you want to add different types of borders to a window. Using the Decorator pattern, you can add these borders dynamically.

```java
interface Window {
    void draw();
}

class SimpleWindow implements Window {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a simple window");
    }
}

abstract class WindowDecorator implements Window {
    protected Window decoratedWindow;

    public WindowDecorator(Window decoratedWindow) {
        this.decoratedWindow = decoratedWindow;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        decoratedWindow.draw();
    }
}

class VerticalScrollBarDecorator extends WindowDecorator {
    public VerticalScrollBarDecorator(Window decoratedWindow) {
        super(decoratedWindow);
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        super.draw();
        drawVerticalScrollBar();
    }

    private void drawVerticalScrollBar() {
        System.out.println("Adding vertical scroll bar");
    }
}

class HorizontalScrollBarDecorator extends WindowDecorator {
    public HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(Window decoratedWindow) {
        super(decoratedWindow);
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        super.draw();
        drawHorizontalScrollBar();
    }

    private void drawHorizontalScrollBar() {
        System.out.println("Adding horizontal scroll bar");
    }
}

public class DecoratorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Window simpleWindow = new SimpleWindow();
        Window decoratedWindow = new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(simpleWindow));
        decoratedWindow.draw();
    }
}
```

### Key Differences Between Proxy and Decorator Patterns

#### Purpose

- **Proxy Pattern**: Primarily used to control access to an object. It can add a layer of security, manage resource usage, or provide a placeholder for remote objects.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Focuses on adding new behavior or responsibilities to an object. It enhances the functionality of objects dynamically without altering their structure.

#### Implementation

- **Proxy**: Implements the same interface as the original object and controls access to it.
- **Decorator**: Also implements the same interface but adds additional behavior by wrapping the original object.

#### Use Cases

- **Proxy**: Ideal for scenarios where access control, lazy initialization, or remote access is required.
- **Decorator**: Suitable for cases where you need to add or modify behavior at runtime without affecting other instances.

#### Real-World Scenarios

- **Proxy**: Used in virtual proxies for lazy loading, protection proxies for access control, and remote proxies for distributed systems.
- **Decorator**: Commonly used in GUI frameworks to add features like scroll bars, borders, or shadows to components.

### Choosing the Right Pattern

Understanding the intent behind each pattern is crucial for making the right choice. Consider the following guidelines:

- **Access Control vs. Behavior Enhancement**: If the primary goal is to control access or manage resources, the Proxy pattern is appropriate. If the goal is to add new behavior or responsibilities, the Decorator pattern is the better choice.
- **Static vs. Dynamic Composition**: Proxies are typically used for static composition, while decorators offer dynamic composition capabilities.
- **Performance Considerations**: Proxies can introduce overhead due to additional layers of indirection, while decorators can increase complexity if overused.

### Practical Applications and Examples

#### Proxy Pattern in Action

- **Security Proxies**: Used in applications where access to sensitive data needs to be controlled.
- **Caching Proxies**: Implemented to cache results of expensive operations and improve performance.

#### Decorator Pattern in Action

- **Java I/O Streams**: The Java I/O library extensively uses the Decorator pattern to add functionality to streams, such as buffering, filtering, and data conversion.
- **UI Component Libraries**: Decorators are used to add visual enhancements to UI components without altering their core functionality.

### Historical Context and Evolution

The Proxy and Decorator patterns have evolved alongside the development of object-oriented programming. The Proxy pattern has its roots in the need for managing access to resources in distributed systems, while the Decorator pattern emerged from the need to extend object functionality without subclassing.

### Conclusion

Both the Proxy and Decorator patterns are essential tools in a Java developer's toolkit. By understanding their distinct purposes and applications, developers can make informed decisions about which pattern to use in various scenarios. This knowledge not only enhances the flexibility and maintainability of software systems but also empowers developers to create more robust and efficient applications.

### Encouragement for Further Exploration

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying them to suit different scenarios. Consider how these patterns can be applied to your own projects and reflect on the benefits they offer. By mastering these patterns, you can elevate your software design skills and create more adaptable and scalable systems.
