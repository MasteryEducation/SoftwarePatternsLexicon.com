## 7.4.1 Implementing Composite in Java

The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to work with tree-like structures, such as file systems, organizational hierarchies, or graphical user interfaces.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Composite pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is achieved by defining a common interface for both simple and complex objects, enabling recursive composition.

### Structure

The Composite pattern consists of the following key components:

- **Component**: An interface or abstract class that defines the common operations for both simple and complex objects.
- **Leaf**: Represents the individual objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.
- **Composite**: Represents the complex objects that may have children. A composite can contain both leaf and composite objects.

#### UML Diagram

Below is a UML diagram representing the structure of the Composite pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +operation()*
    }
    class Leaf {
        +operation()
    }
    class Composite {
        -children : List<Component>
        +add(Component)
        +remove(Component)
        +operation()
    }
    Component <|-- Leaf
    Component <|-- Composite
    Composite o-- Component
```

*Diagram Caption*: This UML diagram illustrates the Composite pattern's structure, showing the relationships between the `Component`, `Leaf`, and `Composite` classes.

### Participants

- **Component**: Declares the interface for objects in the composition and implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes, as appropriate.
- **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children and implements the `Component` interface.
- **Composite**: Defines behavior for components having children and stores child components. Implements child-related operations in the `Component` interface.

### Collaborations

- **Component**: The `Component` interface is implemented by both `Leaf` and `Composite` classes, allowing them to be treated uniformly.
- **Leaf**: Implements the `Component` interface and provides the behavior for leaf nodes.
- **Composite**: Manages child components and implements operations that involve child components.

### Consequences

- **Uniformity**: Clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, simplifying client code.
- **Extensibility**: New `Leaf` or `Composite` classes can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Complexity**: The pattern can introduce complexity due to the recursive nature of the composition.

### Implementation

#### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Define the Component Interface**: Create an interface or abstract class that declares the operations common to both simple and complex objects.
2. **Implement Leaf Class**: Create a class that implements the `Component` interface and represents leaf objects.
3. **Implement Composite Class**: Create a class that implements the `Component` interface and manages child components.
4. **Use Recursion**: Implement operations in the `Composite` class using recursion to traverse the tree structure.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Below is a Java implementation of the Composite pattern:

```java
// Component interface
interface Graphic {
    void draw();
}

// Leaf class
class Circle implements Graphic {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

// Composite class
class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic {
    private List<Graphic> children = new ArrayList<>();

    public void add(Graphic graphic) {
        children.add(graphic);
    }

    public void remove(Graphic graphic) {
        children.remove(graphic);
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        for (Graphic graphic : children) {
            graphic.draw();
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class CompositePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create leaf objects
        Graphic circle1 = new Circle();
        Graphic circle2 = new Circle();

        // Create composite object
        CompositeGraphic compositeGraphic = new CompositeGraphic();
        compositeGraphic.add(circle1);
        compositeGraphic.add(circle2);

        // Draw composite graphic
        compositeGraphic.draw();
    }
}
```

*Explanation*: In this example, the `Graphic` interface defines the `draw` operation. The `Circle` class is a leaf that implements the `Graphic` interface. The `CompositeGraphic` class is a composite that can contain multiple `Graphic` objects, both `Circle` and other `CompositeGraphic` objects.

### Sample Use Cases

- **Graphical User Interfaces**: The Composite pattern is often used in GUI frameworks to represent components like windows, panels, and buttons.
- **File Systems**: File systems use the Composite pattern to represent directories and files, allowing operations to be performed uniformly on both.
- **Organizational Hierarchies**: The pattern can represent organizational structures, where employees can be treated uniformly regardless of their position in the hierarchy.

### Related Patterns

- **[6.6 Singleton Pattern]({{< ref "/patterns-java/6/6" >}} "Singleton Pattern")**: While not directly related, the Singleton pattern can be used in conjunction with the Composite pattern to manage shared resources.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Both patterns allow for the dynamic composition of objects, but the Decorator pattern focuses on adding responsibilities to individual objects, while the Composite pattern focuses on part-whole hierarchies.

### Known Uses

- **Java AWT and Swing**: Both frameworks use the Composite pattern extensively to manage GUI components.
- **Apache Commons Collections**: The library uses the Composite pattern to manage collections of objects.

### Best Practices

- **Use Interfaces**: Define the `Component` as an interface to allow for flexibility and extensibility.
- **Manage Complexity**: Be mindful of the complexity introduced by recursive structures and ensure operations are efficient.
- **Consider Thread Safety**: If the composite structure is accessed by multiple threads, ensure thread safety in the `Composite` class.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overcomplicating Simple Structures**: Avoid using the Composite pattern for simple structures where a single class would suffice.
- **Inefficient Operations**: Ensure that operations on the composite structure are efficient, especially when dealing with large hierarchies.

### Exercises

1. **Modify the Example**: Extend the example by adding a `Rectangle` class and include it in the composite structure.
2. **Implement a File System**: Create a simple file system using the Composite pattern, with `File` and `Directory` classes.
3. **Explore Thread Safety**: Modify the `CompositeGraphic` class to be thread-safe.

### Summary

The Composite pattern is a powerful tool for managing part-whole hierarchies in Java applications. By allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, it simplifies client code and enhances flexibility. When implementing the Composite pattern, consider the trade-offs between uniformity and complexity, and ensure efficient operations over the composite structure.
