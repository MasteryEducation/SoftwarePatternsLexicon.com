## 7.3.1 Implementing Bridge in Java

### Introduction

The **Bridge Pattern** is a structural design pattern that plays a crucial role in software architecture by decoupling an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, enabling flexibility and scalability in your codebase.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Bridge Pattern is to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be modified independently. This separation allows for more flexible code that can adapt to changing requirements without necessitating significant rewrites.

### Applicability

The Bridge Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
- Both the abstraction and its implementation should be extensible by subclassing.
- Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should not affect the client code.
- You need to share an implementation among multiple objects and hide the implementation details from the client.

### Key Components

The Bridge Pattern involves several key components:

- **Abstraction**: Defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to an object of type `Implementor`.
- **RefinedAbstraction**: Extends the interface defined by `Abstraction`.
- **Implementor**: Defines the interface for implementation classes. This interface does not need to correspond directly to `Abstraction`'s interface; it can be entirely different.
- **ConcreteImplementor**: Implements the `Implementor` interface and provides concrete implementations.

### Structure

Below is a UML diagram illustrating the structure of the Bridge Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Abstraction {
        -Implementor implementor
        +operation()
    }
    class RefinedAbstraction {
        +operation()
    }
    class Implementor {
        <<interface>>
        +operationImpl()
    }
    class ConcreteImplementorA {
        +operationImpl()
    }
    class ConcreteImplementorB {
        +operationImpl()
    }
    Abstraction --> Implementor
    RefinedAbstraction --|> Abstraction
    ConcreteImplementorA --|> Implementor
    ConcreteImplementorB --|> Implementor
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The diagram shows how `Abstraction` maintains a reference to `Implementor`, allowing `RefinedAbstraction` to extend `Abstraction` and `ConcreteImplementor` classes to implement `Implementor`.

### Java Code Example

Let's explore a practical implementation of the Bridge Pattern in Java. Consider a scenario where we have different types of remote controls (abstractions) that can operate various devices (implementations).

#### Step 1: Define the Implementor Interface

```java
// Implementor Interface
interface Device {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
    void setVolume(int volume);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Implementors

```java
// Concrete Implementor A
class Television implements Device {
    private int volume;

    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Television is turned on.");
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Television is turned off.");
    }

    @Override
    public void setVolume(int volume) {
        this.volume = volume;
        System.out.println("Television volume set to " + this.volume);
    }
}

// Concrete Implementor B
class Radio implements Device {
    private int volume;

    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Radio is turned on.");
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Radio is turned off.");
    }

    @Override
    public void setVolume(int volume) {
        this.volume = volume;
        System.out.println("Radio volume set to " + this.volume);
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Abstraction

```java
// Abstraction
abstract class RemoteControl {
    protected Device device;

    public RemoteControl(Device device) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public abstract void togglePower();
    public abstract void volumeUp();
    public abstract void volumeDown();
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Refined Abstractions

```java
// Refined Abstraction
class BasicRemoteControl extends RemoteControl {

    public BasicRemoteControl(Device device) {
        super(device);
    }

    @Override
    public void togglePower() {
        System.out.println("Toggling power.");
        // Assume some logic to check current state
        device.turnOn();
    }

    @Override
    public void volumeUp() {
        System.out.println("Increasing volume.");
        device.setVolume(10); // Simplified for demonstration
    }

    @Override
    public void volumeDown() {
        System.out.println("Decreasing volume.");
        device.setVolume(5); // Simplified for demonstration
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Use the Bridge Pattern

```java
public class BridgePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Device tv = new Television();
        RemoteControl tvRemote = new BasicRemoteControl(tv);

        tvRemote.togglePower();
        tvRemote.volumeUp();

        Device radio = new Radio();
        RemoteControl radioRemote = new BasicRemoteControl(radio);

        radioRemote.togglePower();
        radioRemote.volumeDown();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

In this example, the `RemoteControl` class acts as the `Abstraction`, while `BasicRemoteControl` is the `RefinedAbstraction`. The `Device` interface is the `Implementor`, and `Television` and `Radio` are `ConcreteImplementors`. This setup allows the remote control to operate different devices without being tightly coupled to any specific device implementation.

### Benefits of Decoupling

The Bridge Pattern offers several benefits:

- **Flexibility**: By decoupling abstraction from implementation, you can easily extend both hierarchies without affecting each other.
- **Scalability**: New abstractions and implementations can be added independently, supporting the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one part of the code do not necessitate changes in other parts, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

### Supporting the Open/Closed Principle

The Bridge Pattern supports the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new abstractions and implementations to be added without modifying existing code. This is achieved by defining interfaces for both abstraction and implementation, enabling new classes to be added through subclassing.

### Real-World Scenarios

The Bridge Pattern is commonly used in GUI toolkits, where different look-and-feel implementations can be applied to the same set of widgets. It is also used in database drivers, where the same database interface can support multiple database engines.

### Related Patterns

The Bridge Pattern is related to the [Adapter Pattern]({{< ref "/patterns-java/7/4" >}} "Adapter Pattern"), which also involves an interface between two classes. However, the Adapter Pattern is primarily used to make incompatible interfaces compatible, while the Bridge Pattern focuses on decoupling abstraction from implementation.

### Known Uses

The Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) uses the Bridge Pattern to separate the abstraction of GUI components from their platform-specific implementations.

### Conclusion

The Bridge Pattern is a powerful tool for creating flexible and scalable software architectures. By decoupling abstraction from implementation, it allows developers to extend both hierarchies independently, supporting the Open/Closed Principle and enhancing maintainability.
