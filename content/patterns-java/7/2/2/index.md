## 7.2.2 Class Adapter vs. Object Adapter

In the realm of software design patterns, the Adapter Pattern stands out as a crucial tool for achieving compatibility between incompatible interfaces. This section delves into the nuances of the Adapter Pattern, specifically focusing on the two primary forms: **Class Adapter** and **Object Adapter**. Understanding these concepts is vital for Java developers and software architects aiming to create flexible and maintainable codebases.

### Introduction to Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to work together without modifying their existing code. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating legacy systems with new functionalities or when using third-party libraries that do not match the expected interface.

### Class Adapter

#### Definition

A **Class Adapter** uses inheritance to adapt one interface to another. It involves creating a new class that inherits from both the target interface and the adaptee class. This approach leverages Java's multiple interface inheritance capability to achieve the desired adaptation.

#### Implementation

In a class adapter, the adapter class extends the adaptee class and implements the target interface. This allows the adapter to inherit the behavior of the adaptee while providing the interface expected by the client.

```java
// Target interface
interface Target {
    void request();
}

// Adaptee class
class Adaptee {
    void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Adaptee's specific request.");
    }
}

// Class Adapter
class ClassAdapter extends Adaptee implements Target {
    @Override
    public void request() {
        // Adapting the specific request to the target interface
        specificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Target target = new ClassAdapter();
        target.request(); // Output: Adaptee's specific request.
    }
}
```

#### Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**:
  - **Simplicity**: The class adapter is straightforward to implement when the adaptee class is not complex.
  - **Performance**: Since it uses inheritance, there is no additional overhead of object composition.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Single Inheritance Constraint**: Java's single inheritance model restricts the class adapter to extend only one class, which can be a significant limitation if the adapter needs to inherit from multiple classes.
  - **Tight Coupling**: The adapter is tightly coupled to the adaptee class, making it less flexible if the adaptee's implementation changes.

### Object Adapter

#### Definition

An **Object Adapter** uses composition to achieve the adaptation. Instead of inheriting from the adaptee, the adapter holds a reference to an instance of the adaptee class and delegates calls to it.

#### Implementation

In an object adapter, the adapter class implements the target interface and contains an instance of the adaptee class. This allows the adapter to forward requests to the adaptee instance.

```java
// Target interface
interface Target {
    void request();
}

// Adaptee class
class Adaptee {
    void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Adaptee's specific request.");
    }
}

// Object Adapter
class ObjectAdapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;

    public ObjectAdapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void request() {
        // Delegating the request to the adaptee's specific request
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        Target target = new ObjectAdapter(adaptee);
        target.request(); // Output: Adaptee's specific request.
    }
}
```

#### Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**:
  - **Flexibility**: The object adapter is more flexible as it can work with any subclass of the adaptee class.
  - **Loose Coupling**: It promotes loose coupling between the adapter and the adaptee, making it easier to modify or extend the adaptee's behavior.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Complexity**: The object adapter can be more complex to implement, especially if the adaptee has a large number of methods.
  - **Performance Overhead**: There is a slight performance overhead due to the additional level of indirection introduced by composition.

### Comparison: Class Adapter vs. Object Adapter

| Aspect               | Class Adapter                          | Object Adapter                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**      | Uses inheritance                       | Uses composition                       |
| **Flexibility**      | Less flexible due to single inheritance| More flexible, can adapt multiple adaptees |
| **Coupling**         | Tightly coupled to adaptee             | Loosely coupled, easier to modify      |
| **Complexity**       | Simpler to implement                   | More complex due to composition        |
| **Performance**      | Slightly better due to direct inheritance | Slight overhead due to delegation     |

### Historical Context and Evolution

The Adapter Pattern has its roots in the early days of object-oriented programming, where the need to integrate disparate systems became apparent. As software systems grew in complexity, the demand for patterns that could facilitate integration without extensive rework increased. The Adapter Pattern emerged as a solution to this challenge, providing a way to reconcile incompatible interfaces.

Over time, the pattern has evolved to accommodate modern programming paradigms, such as dependency injection and interface-based design. The distinction between class and object adapters reflects the broader shift towards composition over inheritance, a principle that has gained traction in contemporary software design.

### Practical Applications

- **Legacy System Integration**: Adapters are commonly used to integrate legacy systems with new applications, allowing old and new components to interact seamlessly.
- **Third-Party Library Integration**: When using third-party libraries that do not match the expected interface, adapters can bridge the gap without modifying the library code.
- **Testing and Mocking**: Adapters can facilitate testing by allowing mock implementations to be easily swapped in place of real components.

### Choosing Between Class and Object Adapter

The choice between class and object adapters depends on several factors:

- **Inheritance Constraints**: If the adaptee class is already part of an inheritance hierarchy, an object adapter is more suitable due to Java's single inheritance limitation.
- **Flexibility Requirements**: If flexibility and loose coupling are priorities, an object adapter is preferable.
- **Performance Considerations**: In performance-critical applications, a class adapter may be advantageous due to its direct method invocation.

### Conclusion

Both class and object adapters play a vital role in the Adapter Pattern, each offering distinct advantages and trade-offs. By understanding their differences and applications, Java developers and software architects can make informed decisions about which approach best suits their needs. As with any design pattern, the key is to balance flexibility, complexity, and performance to achieve the desired outcome.
