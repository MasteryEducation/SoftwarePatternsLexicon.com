## 7.2.1 Implementing Adapter in Java

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems into new applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter pattern is to allow classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. By doing so, it promotes the reusability of existing classes without modifying their source code, which is especially beneficial when dealing with third-party libraries or legacy systems.

### Motivation

In software development, it is common to encounter situations where a class cannot be used because its interface does not match the one expected by a client. The Adapter pattern solves this problem by creating a wrapper class that translates the interface of the existing class into one that the client can work with. This approach allows developers to reuse existing code and integrate it into new systems seamlessly.

### Participants

The Adapter pattern involves the following participants:

- **Target**: Defines the domain-specific interface that the client uses.
- **Adapter**: Adapts the interface of the Adaptee to the Target interface.
- **Adaptee**: Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
- **Client**: Collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.

### Structure

The Adapter pattern can be implemented in two ways: class adapter and object adapter. Below is a UML diagram illustrating the class relationships for both implementations.

#### Class Adapter

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        +request()
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter --|> Adaptee
```

#### Object Adapter

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        +request()
    }
    class Adapter {
        -adaptee: Adaptee
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter o-- Adaptee
```

*Figure 2: Object Adapter Pattern Structure*

### Implementation

#### Class Adapter Implementation

The class adapter uses inheritance to adapt the Adaptee to the Target interface. This approach is limited by Java's single inheritance constraint, meaning the Adapter can only extend one class.

```java
// Target interface
interface Target {
    void request();
}

// Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class Adaptee {
    void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Adaptee's specific request.");
    }
}

// Adapter class that adapts Adaptee to Target
class Adapter extends Adaptee implements Target {
    @Override
    public void request() {
        // Translate the request to the specific request
        specificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Target target = new Adapter();
        target.request(); // Outputs: Adaptee's specific request.
    }
}
```

*Explanation*: In this example, the `Adapter` class extends `Adaptee` and implements the `Target` interface. The `request` method in `Adapter` calls the `specificRequest` method of `Adaptee`, thus adapting the interface.

#### Object Adapter Implementation

The object adapter uses composition to achieve the adaptation. This approach is more flexible as it allows the Adapter to work with multiple Adaptees.

```java
// Target interface
interface Target {
    void request();
}

// Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class Adaptee {
    void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Adaptee's specific request.");
    }
}

// Adapter class that adapts Adaptee to Target
class Adapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void request() {
        // Translate the request to the specific request
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        Target target = new Adapter(adaptee);
        target.request(); // Outputs: Adaptee's specific request.
    }
}
```

*Explanation*: In this example, the `Adapter` class holds a reference to an `Adaptee` object. The `request` method in `Adapter` calls the `specificRequest` method of the `Adaptee`, thus adapting the interface.

### Practical Applications

The Adapter pattern is widely used in scenarios where systems need to integrate with third-party libraries or legacy systems. For example, consider a payment processing system that needs to integrate with multiple payment gateways, each with its own API. By using the Adapter pattern, developers can create a uniform interface for the payment processing system, allowing it to interact with different payment gateways seamlessly.

### Promoting Reusability

The Adapter pattern promotes reusability by allowing existing classes to be used in new contexts without modification. This is particularly beneficial when working with third-party libraries, where modifying the source code is not an option. By creating an adapter, developers can integrate these libraries into their systems without altering their interfaces.

### Integrating Third-Party Libraries and Legacy Systems

When integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems, the Adapter pattern provides a way to bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces. For example, if a legacy system uses a different data format than a new application, an adapter can be created to convert the data format, allowing the two systems to communicate effectively.

### Best Practices

- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: When possible, use the object adapter approach as it provides more flexibility and adheres to the principle of favoring composition over inheritance.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure that the adapter only handles the translation of interfaces and does not introduce additional logic.
- **Interface Segregation**: Design the Target interface to be as minimal as possible, exposing only the necessary methods to the client.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overuse of Adapters**: Avoid using adapters excessively, as this can lead to a complex and hard-to-maintain codebase.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of the potential performance overhead introduced by the adapter, especially in performance-critical applications.

### Exercises

1. Implement an adapter for a third-party logging library that uses a different logging interface than your application.
2. Create an adapter that allows a legacy XML-based configuration system to work with a new JSON-based configuration system.

### Conclusion

The Adapter pattern is a powerful tool for integrating incompatible interfaces, promoting code reusability, and facilitating the integration of third-party libraries and legacy systems. By understanding and applying this pattern, developers can create flexible and maintainable software systems that can adapt to changing requirements.
