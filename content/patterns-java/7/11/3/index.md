## 7.11.3 Extension Objects vs. Decorators

### Introduction

In the realm of software design, the ability to extend and enhance the functionality of classes without modifying their existing code is crucial. Two design patterns that facilitate this are the **Extension Object Pattern** and the **Decorator Pattern**. Both patterns allow for the addition of behavior to objects, but they do so in fundamentally different ways. Understanding these differences is key to selecting the right pattern for your design needs.

### Extension Objects: Adding Interfaces

The **Extension Object Pattern** is a structural pattern that allows for the addition of new interfaces to objects dynamically. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to extend the capabilities of a class without altering its existing structure. It provides a way to add new functionality by defining new interfaces and implementing them in separate extension objects.

#### Key Characteristics of Extension Objects

- **Interface Addition**: Unlike Decorators, which focus on adding methods, Extension Objects enable the addition of entire interfaces.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: New interfaces can be added at runtime, offering flexibility and adaptability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By decoupling the extensions from the core class, it promotes a clean separation of concerns.

#### Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where you have a `Document` class in a text editor application. Initially, the `Document` class supports basic operations like `open`, `close`, and `save`. Over time, you might want to add new features such as spell checking, grammar checking, or version control. Instead of modifying the `Document` class directly, you can use the Extension Object Pattern to add these features as separate interfaces.

```java
// Core Document class
public class Document {
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Document opened.");
    }

    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Document closed.");
    }

    public void save() {
        System.out.println("Document saved.");
    }
}

// Extension interface for spell checking
public interface SpellCheckExtension {
    void checkSpelling();
}

// SpellCheck extension implementation
public class SpellCheckExtensionImpl implements SpellCheckExtension {
    @Override
    public void checkSpelling() {
        System.out.println("Spell checking completed.");
    }
}

// Client code
public class TextEditor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document document = new Document();
        document.open();
        
        // Adding spell check functionality
        SpellCheckExtension spellCheck = new SpellCheckExtensionImpl();
        spellCheck.checkSpelling();
        
        document.save();
        document.close();
    }
}
```

### Decorators: Wrapping and Enhancing

The **Decorator Pattern** is another structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

#### Key Characteristics of Decorators

- **Method Addition**: Decorators wrap objects to add new methods or enhance existing ones.
- **Adherence to Interface**: Decorators adhere to a common interface, ensuring that the core object's interface remains unchanged.
- **Layered Enhancements**: Multiple decorators can be stacked to provide layered enhancements.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine a coffee shop application where you have a `Coffee` interface. You want to add different condiments like milk, sugar, and whipped cream to the coffee. Using the Decorator Pattern, you can create decorators for each condiment and apply them to the coffee object.

```java
// Coffee interface
public interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double cost();
}

// Basic coffee implementation
public class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return 2.00;
    }
}

// Abstract decorator class
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost();
    }
}

// Milk decorator
public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost() + 0.50;
    }
}

// Client code
public class CoffeeShop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());

        // Adding milk to the coffee
        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());
    }
}
```

### When to Use Each Pattern

#### Extension Objects

- **Use when**: You need to add new interfaces to objects dynamically and want to maintain a clean separation of concerns.
- **Ideal for**: Systems where new functionalities are frequently added and removed, such as plugin architectures.

#### Decorators

- **Use when**: You want to add responsibilities to individual objects without affecting others.
- **Ideal for**: Situations where you need to enhance or modify the behavior of objects in a flexible and reusable manner.

### Impact on System Design and Extensibility

Both patterns have significant implications for system design and extensibility:

- **Extension Objects** offer greater flexibility in terms of adding new capabilities without altering existing code. They are particularly useful in systems that require frequent updates or where different combinations of features are needed.
- **Decorators** provide a more straightforward approach to adding functionality to objects. They are ideal for scenarios where behavior needs to be layered or combined in various ways.

### Historical Context and Evolution

The Decorator Pattern has its roots in the early days of object-oriented programming, where it was used to address the limitations of inheritance. It provides a way to extend functionality without the need for extensive subclassing. The Extension Object Pattern, on the other hand, emerged as a solution to the limitations of static type systems, allowing for more dynamic and flexible designs.

### Conclusion

Understanding the differences between Extension Objects and Decorators is crucial for making informed design decisions. By leveraging the strengths of each pattern, developers can create systems that are both flexible and maintainable. Whether you need to add new interfaces or simply enhance existing behavior, these patterns offer powerful tools for extending the capabilities of your Java applications.
