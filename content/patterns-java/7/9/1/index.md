## 7.9.1 Implementing Event Sourcing in Java

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that involves storing the state of a system as a sequence of events. These events represent changes to the system's state, and the current state can be reconstructed by replaying these events. This approach offers several benefits, including improved auditability, the ability to reconstruct past states, and enhanced scalability.

In this section, we will explore how to implement Event Sourcing in Java. We'll cover the creation of event classes, the implementation of an event store, the use of aggregators, and the reconstruction of application state from events. Additionally, we'll discuss the use of event streams and snapshots, as well as considerations for performance and storage.

### Understanding Event Sourcing

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly understand the core concepts of Event Sourcing:

- **Event**: A record of a change to the system's state. Events are immutable and represent facts that have occurred.
- **Event Store**: A storage mechanism for persisting events. It acts as the source of truth for the system's state.
- **Aggregator**: An entity that processes events to maintain the current state of the system.
- **Snapshot**: A periodic capture of the system's state, used to optimize the process of state reconstruction.

### Setting Up Event Sourcing in Java

To implement Event Sourcing in Java, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Define Event Classes**: Create classes that represent different types of events.
2. **Implement an Event Store**: Develop a mechanism to persist and retrieve events.
3. **Create Aggregators**: Implement logic to process events and maintain the current state.
4. **Reconstruct State from Events**: Use events to rebuild the system's state.
5. **Utilize Event Streams and Snapshots**: Optimize state reconstruction using snapshots.

#### Defining Event Classes

Event classes are the building blocks of Event Sourcing. Each event class represents a specific change to the system's state. Let's define a simple event class in Java:

```java
public abstract class Event {
    private final String eventId;
    private final long timestamp;

    public Event(String eventId, long timestamp) {
        this.eventId = eventId;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
    }

    public String getEventId() {
        return eventId;
    }

    public long getTimestamp() {
        return timestamp;
    }
}

public class AccountCreatedEvent extends Event {
    private final String accountId;
    private final String ownerName;

    public AccountCreatedEvent(String eventId, long timestamp, String accountId, String ownerName) {
        super(eventId, timestamp);
        this.accountId = accountId;
        this.ownerName = ownerName;
    }

    public String getAccountId() {
        return accountId;
    }

    public String getOwnerName() {
        return ownerName;
    }
}

public class MoneyDepositedEvent extends Event {
    private final String accountId;
    private final double amount;

    public MoneyDepositedEvent(String eventId, long timestamp, String accountId, double amount) {
        super(eventId, timestamp);
        this.accountId = accountId;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public String getAccountId() {
        return accountId;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a base `Event` class and two specific event types: `AccountCreatedEvent` and `MoneyDepositedEvent`. Each event contains relevant data and metadata, such as an event ID and timestamp.

#### Implementing an Event Store

The event store is responsible for persisting and retrieving events. It acts as the system's source of truth. Let's implement a simple in-memory event store in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class InMemoryEventStore {
    private final List<Event> events = new ArrayList<>();

    public void saveEvent(Event event) {
        events.add(event);
    }

    public List<Event> getEventsForAccount(String accountId) {
        return events.stream()
                .filter(event -> event instanceof AccountCreatedEvent && ((AccountCreatedEvent) event).getAccountId().equals(accountId) ||
                                 event instanceof MoneyDepositedEvent && ((MoneyDepositedEvent) event).getAccountId().equals(accountId))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

This `InMemoryEventStore` class provides methods to save events and retrieve events related to a specific account. In a production environment, you would replace this with a more robust storage solution, such as a database.

#### Creating Aggregators

Aggregators process events to maintain the current state of the system. Let's create an aggregator for managing account balances:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class AccountAggregator {
    private double balance;

    public AccountAggregator() {
        this.balance = 0.0;
    }

    public void applyEvents(List<Event> events) {
        for (Event event : events) {
            if (event instanceof MoneyDepositedEvent) {
                apply((MoneyDepositedEvent) event);
            }
        }
    }

    private void apply(MoneyDepositedEvent event) {
        balance += event.getAmount();
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

The `AccountAggregator` class processes `MoneyDepositedEvent` events to update the account balance. It maintains the current state by applying each event in sequence.

#### Reconstructing State from Events

To reconstruct the state of the system, we replay the events stored in the event store. Here's how we can achieve this:

```java
public class AccountService {
    private final InMemoryEventStore eventStore;

    public AccountService(InMemoryEventStore eventStore) {
        this.eventStore = eventStore;
    }

    public double getAccountBalance(String accountId) {
        List<Event> events = eventStore.getEventsForAccount(accountId);
        AccountAggregator aggregator = new AccountAggregator();
        aggregator.applyEvents(events);
        return aggregator.getBalance();
    }
}
```

The `AccountService` class retrieves events for a specific account and uses the `AccountAggregator` to reconstruct the account balance.

#### Utilizing Event Streams and Snapshots

As the number of events grows, reconstructing the state by replaying all events can become inefficient. To address this, we can use snapshots to periodically capture the state of the system. This allows us to start replaying events from the last snapshot, reducing the number of events that need to be processed.

Here's an example of how to implement snapshots:

```java
public class Snapshot {
    private final String accountId;
    private final double balance;
    private final long timestamp;

    public Snapshot(String accountId, double balance, long timestamp) {
        this.accountId = accountId;
        this.balance = balance;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
    }

    public String getAccountId() {
        return accountId;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public long getTimestamp() {
        return timestamp;
    }
}

public class SnapshotStore {
    private final List<Snapshot> snapshots = new ArrayList<>();

    public void saveSnapshot(Snapshot snapshot) {
        snapshots.add(snapshot);
    }

    public Snapshot getLatestSnapshot(String accountId) {
        return snapshots.stream()
                .filter(snapshot -> snapshot.getAccountId().equals(accountId))
                .max((s1, s2) -> Long.compare(s1.getTimestamp(), s2.getTimestamp()))
                .orElse(null);
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `SnapshotStore` class manages snapshots, allowing us to save and retrieve the latest snapshot for a specific account.

### Performance and Storage Considerations

When implementing Event Sourcing, it's important to consider performance and storage:

- **Event Store**: Choose a storage solution that can handle high write and read throughput. Consider using databases optimized for append-only operations, such as Apache Kafka or EventStoreDB.
- **Snapshots**: Determine an appropriate snapshot frequency based on the system's requirements. More frequent snapshots reduce the number of events that need to be replayed but increase storage requirements.
- **Event Streams**: Organize events into streams based on logical groupings, such as by account or entity type. This allows for efficient retrieval and processing of events.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale horizontally by partitioning event streams and distributing them across multiple nodes.

### Visualizing Event Sourcing Architecture

To better understand the flow of data in an Event Sourcing system, let's visualize the architecture using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid

    A[User Action] --> B[Generate Event]
    B --> C[Event Store]
    C --> D[Snapshot Store]
    C --> E[Event Stream]
    E --> F[Aggregator]
    F --> G[Reconstructed State]
    D --> F
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of generating events from user actions, storing them in the event store, and using snapshots and event streams to reconstruct the system's state through aggregators.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of Event Sourcing, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Add New Event Types**: Create additional event classes to represent different types of changes, such as `MoneyWithdrawnEvent`.
- **Implement a Persistent Event Store**: Replace the in-memory event store with a database-backed implementation.
- **Optimize State Reconstruction**: Experiment with different snapshot frequencies and observe the impact on performance.
