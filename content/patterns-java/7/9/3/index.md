## 7.9.3 Use Cases and Examples

The **Private Class Data pattern** is a structural design pattern that encapsulates class data to ensure that it remains immutable and secure. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where data integrity and thread safety are paramount. In this section, we will explore various use cases and examples that demonstrate the practical applications of the Private Class Data pattern in Java.

### Immutability and Read-Only Objects

Immutability is a core concept in software design that ensures objects cannot be modified after they are created. This is crucial in multi-threaded environments where concurrent modifications can lead to unpredictable behavior and bugs. The Private Class Data pattern helps achieve immutability by encapsulating data and providing controlled access through read-only interfaces.

#### Example: Immutable Configuration Settings

Consider a scenario where an application requires configuration settings that should not change during runtime. Using the Private Class Data pattern, we can encapsulate these settings in a class and expose only read-only methods.

```java
// Immutable Configuration class using Private Class Data pattern
public final class Configuration {
    private final ConfigurationData data;

    public Configuration(String databaseUrl, String username, String password) {
        this.data = new ConfigurationData(databaseUrl, username, password);
    }

    public String getDatabaseUrl() {
        return data.getDatabaseUrl();
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return data.getUsername();
    }

    // No setter methods provided, ensuring immutability

    // Private inner class to encapsulate configuration data
    private static class ConfigurationData {
        private final String databaseUrl;
        private final String username;
        private final String password;

        ConfigurationData(String databaseUrl, String username, String password) {
            this.databaseUrl = databaseUrl;
            this.username = username;
            this.password = password;
        }

        String getDatabaseUrl() {
            return databaseUrl;
        }

        String getUsername() {
            return username;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Configuration` class encapsulates its data using a private inner class `ConfigurationData`. This ensures that the configuration settings remain immutable and secure.

### Multi-Threaded Environments

In multi-threaded applications, data consistency and thread safety are critical. The Private Class Data pattern can help avoid synchronization issues by ensuring that shared data is immutable and accessed in a controlled manner.

#### Example: Thread-Safe User Profile

Imagine a web application where user profiles are accessed by multiple threads. Using the Private Class Data pattern, we can create a thread-safe user profile class.

```java
// Thread-safe UserProfile class using Private Class Data pattern
public final class UserProfile {
    private final UserProfileData data;

    public UserProfile(String name, String email, String phoneNumber) {
        this.data = new UserProfileData(name, email, phoneNumber);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return data.getName();
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return data.getEmail();
    }

    public String getPhoneNumber() {
        return data.getPhoneNumber();
    }

    // Private inner class to encapsulate user profile data
    private static class UserProfileData {
        private final String name;
        private final String email;
        private final String phoneNumber;

        UserProfileData(String name, String email, String phoneNumber) {
            this.name = name;
            this.email = email;
            this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        }

        String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        String getEmail() {
            return email;
        }

        String getPhoneNumber() {
            return phoneNumber;
        }
    }
}
```

By encapsulating user profile data in a private inner class, we ensure that the data remains immutable and thread-safe, preventing any synchronization issues.

### Security Enhancements

The Private Class Data pattern complements other security measures by restricting access to sensitive data. By encapsulating data and providing controlled access, we can prevent unauthorized modifications and enhance the overall security of the application.

#### Example: Secure Payment Information

In a payment processing system, it is crucial to protect sensitive payment information. The Private Class Data pattern can be used to encapsulate payment details and expose only necessary information.

```java
// Secure PaymentInfo class using Private Class Data pattern
public final class PaymentInfo {
    private final PaymentData data;

    public PaymentInfo(String cardNumber, String cardHolderName, String expirationDate) {
        this.data = new PaymentData(cardNumber, cardHolderName, expirationDate);
    }

    public String getCardHolderName() {
        return data.getCardHolderName();
    }

    public String getExpirationDate() {
        return data.getExpirationDate();
    }

    // Private inner class to encapsulate payment data
    private static class PaymentData {
        private final String cardNumber;
        private final String cardHolderName;
        private final String expirationDate;

        PaymentData(String cardNumber, String cardHolderName, String expirationDate) {
            this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
            this.cardHolderName = cardHolderName;
            this.expirationDate = expirationDate;
        }

        String getCardHolderName() {
            return cardHolderName;
        }

        String getExpirationDate() {
            return expirationDate;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `PaymentInfo` class encapsulates sensitive payment data, ensuring that only authorized information is exposed.

### Complementing Other Patterns

The Private Class Data pattern can be used in conjunction with other design patterns to enhance their effectiveness. For instance, it can be combined with the [6.6 Singleton Pattern]({{< ref "/patterns-java/6/6" >}} "Singleton Pattern") to ensure that a single instance of immutable data is shared across the application.

#### Example: Singleton Configuration with Private Class Data

```java
// Singleton Configuration class using Private Class Data pattern
public final class SingletonConfiguration {
    private static SingletonConfiguration instance;
    private final ConfigurationData data;

    private SingletonConfiguration(String databaseUrl, String username, String password) {
        this.data = new ConfigurationData(databaseUrl, username, password);
    }

    public static synchronized SingletonConfiguration getInstance(String databaseUrl, String username, String password) {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SingletonConfiguration(databaseUrl, username, password);
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public String getDatabaseUrl() {
        return data.getDatabaseUrl();
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return data.getUsername();
    }

    // Private inner class to encapsulate configuration data
    private static class ConfigurationData {
        private final String databaseUrl;
        private final String username;
        private final String password;

        ConfigurationData(String databaseUrl, String username, String password) {
            this.databaseUrl = databaseUrl;
            this.username = username;
            this.password = password;
        }

        String getDatabaseUrl() {
            return databaseUrl;
        }

        String getUsername() {
            return username;
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how the Private Class Data pattern can be combined with the Singleton pattern to create a thread-safe, immutable configuration class.

### Historical Context and Evolution

The Private Class Data pattern has evolved alongside the increasing need for secure and efficient software design. Initially, the focus was on encapsulation and data hiding, but with the advent of multi-threaded programming and security concerns, the pattern has adapted to address these challenges.
