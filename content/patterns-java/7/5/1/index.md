## 7.5.1 Implementing Decorator in Java

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to add responsibilities to objects without modifying their code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Decorator pattern is to provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. By wrapping an object with a series of decorators, you can add new behaviors or responsibilities at runtime. This approach promotes composition over inheritance, allowing for more modular and maintainable code.

### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Decorators can be combined in various ways to achieve different behaviors.
- **Reusability**: Common functionalities can be extracted into decorators and reused across different components.
- **Adherence to SOLID Principles**: Specifically, the Open/Closed Principle, as classes are open for extension but closed for modification.

### Components of the Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern consists of several key components:

1. **Component**: This is the interface or abstract class defining the operations that can be dynamically added to objects.
2. **ConcreteComponent**: This is the class that implements the Component interface. It is the object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
3. **Decorator**: This is an abstract class that implements the Component interface and contains a reference to a Component object. It delegates operations to the component it decorates.
4. **ConcreteDecorator**: This class extends the Decorator class and adds additional responsibilities to the component.

### Class Diagram

Below is a class diagram illustrating the structure of the Decorator pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation()
    }
    class Decorator {
        -component: Component
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorA {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorB {
        +operation()
    }
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorA
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorB
    Decorator o-- Component
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The `Component` interface is implemented by both `ConcreteComponent` and `Decorator`. The `Decorator` class holds a reference to a `Component` object and delegates the `operation()` method to it. `ConcreteDecoratorA` and `ConcreteDecoratorB` extend `Decorator` and add their own behavior.

### Java Code Example

Let's implement the Decorator pattern in Java to demonstrate how additional responsibilities can be dynamically added to objects.

```java
// Component interface
interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}

// ConcreteComponent
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return 5.0;
    }
}

// Decorator
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost();
    }
}

// ConcreteDecoratorA
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost() + 1.5;
    }
}

// ConcreteDecoratorB
class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost() + 0.5;
    }
}

// Client code
public class CoffeeShop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());

        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());

        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, `SimpleCoffee` is the `ConcreteComponent`, and `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` are `ConcreteDecorators` that add milk and sugar to the coffee, respectively. The `CoffeeDecorator` class is the `Decorator` that holds a reference to a `Coffee` object and delegates the `getDescription()` and `getCost()` methods to it.

### Wrapping Components with Decorators

To dynamically add behaviors, wrap the `ConcreteComponent` with one or more `ConcreteDecorators`. Each decorator adds its own behavior before or after delegating the call to the component it decorates. This allows for incremental addition of responsibilities.

### Transparency to the Client

The Decorator pattern ensures that the client code remains unaware of the added responsibilities. The client interacts with the `Component` interface, and the decorators seamlessly add behavior without altering the interface. This transparency is crucial for maintaining a clean and understandable codebase.

### Practical Applications

The Decorator pattern is widely used in GUI toolkits to add functionalities like borders, scroll bars, and shadows to windows or components. It is also used in I/O streams in Java, where different streams can be wrapped to add functionalities like buffering, compression, or encryption.

### Best Practices

- **Use Decorators for Optional Features**: When features are optional and can be combined in various ways, decorators provide a clean solution.
- **Avoid Overuse**: Excessive use of decorators can lead to complex and hard-to-understand code. Use them judiciously.
- **Ensure Interface Consistency**: All decorators should adhere to the component interface to ensure transparency.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Complexity**: Over-decorating can lead to a complex structure that is difficult to debug.
- **Performance Overhead**: Each layer of decoration adds a level of indirection, which can impact performance.

### Exercises

1. **Experiment with Different Decorators**: Modify the example to add more decorators, such as `VanillaDecorator` or `CaramelDecorator`.
2. **Implement a New Component**: Create a new `Component` implementation and apply existing decorators to it.
3. **Explore Java I/O Streams**: Investigate how Java's I/O streams use the Decorator pattern.

### Conclusion

The Decorator pattern is a powerful tool for adding responsibilities to objects dynamically. By understanding and implementing this pattern, developers can create flexible and maintainable systems that adhere to solid design principles.
