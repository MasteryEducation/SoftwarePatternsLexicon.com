## 3.2 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Introduction to the DRY Principle

The **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle is a fundamental concept in software engineering that emphasizes the reduction of code duplication. Coined by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book *The Pragmatic Programmer*, the DRY principle asserts that "every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." This principle is crucial for creating maintainable, efficient, and error-free codebases.

### Significance of the DRY Principle

Adhering to the DRY principle is essential for several reasons:

- **Maintainability**: Reducing duplication makes it easier to update and maintain code. Changes need to be made in only one place, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the same logic is applied uniformly across the codebase, preventing inconsistencies.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the development process by minimizing redundant code, which can lead to faster development cycles.
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer lines of code mean fewer opportunities for bugs to occur.

### The Pitfalls of Code Duplication

Code duplication can lead to several issues, including:

- **Increased Maintenance Effort**: When the same logic is duplicated across multiple locations, any change requires updates in each instance, increasing the workload.
- **Inconsistencies**: Duplication can lead to slight variations in logic, causing inconsistencies and potential bugs.
- **Code Bloat**: Redundant code increases the size of the codebase, making it harder to navigate and understand.

### Strategies to Avoid Duplication

To adhere to the DRY principle, consider the following strategies:

#### Abstraction

Abstraction involves creating a general solution that can be reused in different contexts. This can be achieved through:

- **Methods**: Encapsulate repeated logic in a method that can be called whenever needed.
- **Classes and Interfaces**: Use classes and interfaces to define common behaviors and properties.

#### Utility Classes

Utility classes provide a centralized location for common functions and operations. They are typically declared as `final` with a private constructor to prevent instantiation.

```java
public final class MathUtils {
    private MathUtils() {
        // Prevent instantiation
    }

    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

#### Inheritance and Composition

Inheritance allows you to define a base class with common functionality that can be extended by subclasses. Composition involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones.

```java
// Base class
public class Vehicle {
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

// Subclass
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}
```

#### Refactoring for DRY

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It is a powerful tool for eliminating duplication.

**Example Before Refactoring:**

```java
public class OrderProcessor {
    public void processOnlineOrder() {
        System.out.println("Processing online order");
        // Duplicate logic
        System.out.println("Payment processed");
        System.out.println("Order shipped");
    }

    public void processInStoreOrder() {
        System.out.println("Processing in-store order");
        // Duplicate logic
        System.out.println("Payment processed");
        System.out.println("Order shipped");
    }
}
```

**Example After Refactoring:**

```java
public class OrderProcessor {
    public void processOrder(String orderType) {
        System.out.println("Processing " + orderType + " order");
        processPayment();
        shipOrder();
    }

    private void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Payment processed");
    }

    private void shipOrder() {
        System.out.println("Order shipped");
    }
}
```

### Design Patterns Supporting DRY

Design patterns inherently promote the DRY principle by encouraging code reuse and modularity. Here are a few patterns that exemplify this:

#### Singleton Pattern

The [Singleton Pattern]({{< ref "/patterns-java/6/6" >}} "Singleton Pattern") ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern prevents duplication of instances and centralizes control.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern reduces duplication by centralizing object creation logic.

```java
public abstract class Creator {
    public abstract Product createProduct();

    public void someOperation() {
        Product product = createProduct();
        // Use the product
    }
}

public class ConcreteCreator extends Creator {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProduct();
    }
}
```

#### Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern promotes reuse by allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

```java
public abstract class AbstractClass {
    public final void templateMethod() {
        stepOne();
        stepTwo();
        stepThree();
    }

    protected abstract void stepOne();
    protected abstract void stepTwo();
    protected abstract void stepThree();
}

public class ConcreteClass extends AbstractClass {
    @Override
    protected void stepOne() {
        System.out.println("Step One");
    }

    @Override
    protected void stepTwo() {
        System.out.println("Step Two");
    }

    @Override
    protected void stepThree() {
        System.out.println("Step Three");
    }
}
```

### Real-World Scenarios

Consider a large-scale enterprise application where multiple modules require similar data validation logic. Instead of duplicating validation code across modules, a centralized validation utility can be created, adhering to the DRY principle.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Over-Abstraction**: Avoid creating overly complex abstractions that are difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Premature Optimization**: Focus on eliminating duplication that impacts maintainability and readability, rather than optimizing for performance too early.
- **Ignoring Context**: Ensure that abstractions are contextually relevant and not forced into unrelated areas.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. Refactor a piece of code in your current project to eliminate duplication.
2. Implement a utility class for common string operations in Java.
3. Use the Template Method Pattern to refactor a series of similar algorithms in your codebase.
