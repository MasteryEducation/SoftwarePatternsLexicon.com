## 3.7.6 Polymorphism

### Introduction to Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. The term "polymorphism" is derived from the Greek words "poly," meaning many, and "morph," meaning form. In Java, polymorphism enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, allowing for flexibility and the reuse of code.

#### Definition

In the context of OOP, polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. This is achieved through two primary mechanisms in Java: inheritance and interfaces.

### Polymorphism Through Inheritance

Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit the properties and methods of a superclass. This relationship enables polymorphism by allowing a subclass to override methods of the superclass, providing specific implementations.

#### Example: Inheritance-Based Polymorphism

Consider a simple example involving a superclass `Animal` and its subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`.

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

// Subclass
class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Dog barks
        myCat.makeSound(); // Outputs: Cat meows
    }
}
```

In this example, the `makeSound` method is overridden in the subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`. The `main` method demonstrates polymorphism by calling the overridden methods on objects of type `Animal`.

### Polymorphism Through Interfaces

Interfaces in Java provide another way to achieve polymorphism. An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill, allowing them to be used interchangeably.

#### Example: Interface-Based Polymorphism

Consider an interface `Shape` with implementing classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

```java
// Interface
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// Implementing class
class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

// Implementing class
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape myCircle = new Circle();
        Shape myRectangle = new Rectangle();

        myCircle.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a circle
        myRectangle.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a rectangle
    }
}
```

In this example, both `Circle` and `Rectangle` implement the `Shape` interface, allowing them to be used interchangeably in the `main` method.

### Interchangeable Components

Polymorphism allows for interchangeable components, which is a powerful feature in software design. By programming to an interface rather than an implementation, developers can create flexible and reusable code. This approach is fundamental in design patterns such as Strategy and State.

#### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

```java
// Strategy interface
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

// Concrete strategy
class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }
}

// Concrete strategy
class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal");
    }
}

// Context
class ShoppingCart {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
        cart.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());
        cart.checkout(100); // Outputs: Paid 100 using Credit Card

        cart.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
        cart.checkout(200); // Outputs: Paid 200 using PayPal
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ShoppingCart` class uses the `PaymentStrategy` interface to process payments. The strategy can be changed at runtime, demonstrating the power of polymorphism.

#### State Pattern

The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

```java
// State interface
interface State {
    void handle();
}

// Concrete state
class HappyState implements State {
    @Override
    public void handle() {
        System.out.println("I'm happy!");
    }
}

// Concrete state
class SadState implements State {
    @Override
    public void handle() {
        System.out.println("I'm sad.");
    }
}

// Context
class Person {
    private State state;

    public void setState(State state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void express() {
        state.handle();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setState(new HappyState());
        person.express(); // Outputs: I'm happy!

        person.setState(new SadState());
        person.express(); // Outputs: I'm sad.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class changes its behavior based on its current state, demonstrating polymorphism through the State Pattern.

### Best Practices for Leveraging Polymorphism

1. **Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation**: This principle allows for flexibility and interchangeability of components.

2. **Use Polymorphism to Simplify Code**: Avoid complex conditional logic by using polymorphism to handle variations in behavior.

3. **Ensure Proper Use of Inheritance**: Use inheritance judiciously to avoid creating tightly coupled code. Favor composition over inheritance when possible.

4. **Leverage Java's Type System**: Use Java's type system to enforce contracts and ensure that objects adhere to expected behaviors.

5. **Avoid Overuse of Polymorphism**: While powerful, overusing polymorphism can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain. Use it where it provides clear benefits.

### Conclusion

Polymorphism is a powerful feature of Java that enables flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in software design. By understanding and applying polymorphism effectively, developers can create robust and adaptable systems. Whether through inheritance or interfaces, polymorphism allows for interchangeable components and plays a crucial role in many design patterns, such as Strategy and State. By following best practices, developers can leverage polymorphism to its fullest potential, creating software that is both efficient and elegant.
