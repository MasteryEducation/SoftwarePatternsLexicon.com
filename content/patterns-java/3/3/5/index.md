## 3.3.5 Use Cases and Examples

In the world of software engineering, the Factory Method pattern is a cornerstone of creational design patterns. It provides a way to delegate the instantiation of objects to subclasses, enhancing flexibility and promoting code reuse. In this section, we will delve into practical scenarios where the Factory Method pattern is effectively employed, such as in dialog boxes creating different types of buttons and document creation in word processors and spreadsheets. We will discuss why the pattern is suitable for these scenarios, provide illustrative code snippets, and highlight the benefits realized, such as ease of extension and decoupling of code.

### Understanding the Factory Method Pattern

Before diving into examples, let's briefly revisit what the Factory Method pattern entails. The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create or when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects to be created.

### Real-World Example 1: Dialog Boxes Creating Different Types of Buttons

In graphical user interfaces (GUIs), dialog boxes often need to create buttons that perform various actions. Depending on the context, these buttons might have different appearances or behaviors. The Factory Method pattern can be used to encapsulate the creation logic for these buttons, allowing for easy extension and customization.

#### Why the Factory Method Pattern?

- **Decoupling**: The dialog box class does not need to know the specifics of the button creation, which promotes loose coupling.
- **Extensibility**: New button types can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Reusability**: The button creation logic can be reused across different dialog boxes.

#### Code Example

Let's consider a scenario where we have a `Dialog` class that needs to create buttons. We will define an abstract `Dialog` class with a `createButton` method, which will be implemented by subclasses.

```java
// Abstract Product
interface Button {
    void render();
    void onClick();
}

// Concrete Product 1
class WindowsButton implements Button {
    @Override
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering Windows button.");
    }

    @Override
    public void onClick() {
        System.out.println("Windows button clicked!");
    }
}

// Concrete Product 2
class HTMLButton implements Button {
    @Override
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering HTML button.");
    }

    @Override
    public void onClick() {
        System.out.println("HTML button clicked!");
    }
}

// Creator
abstract class Dialog {
    public void renderWindow() {
        Button okButton = createButton();
        okButton.render();
    }

    // Factory Method
    protected abstract Button createButton();
}

// Concrete Creator 1
class WindowsDialog extends Dialog {
    @Override
    protected Button createButton() {
        return new WindowsButton();
    }
}

// Concrete Creator 2
class WebDialog extends Dialog {
    @Override
    protected Button createButton() {
        return new HTMLButton();
    }
}

// Client code
public class FactoryMethodDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dialog dialog = new WindowsDialog();
        dialog.renderWindow();

        dialog = new WebDialog();
        dialog.renderWindow();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Dialog` class defines the `createButton` method, which is implemented by `WindowsDialog` and `WebDialog` to create `WindowsButton` and `HTMLButton`, respectively. This setup allows for easy addition of new button types without altering the existing dialog classes.

### Real-World Example 2: Document Creation in Software

Consider a word processor that supports different document types, such as text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. The Factory Method pattern can be used to manage the creation of these documents, allowing the application to support new document types without modifying existing code.

#### Why the Factory Method Pattern?

- **Flexibility**: The application can easily switch between different document types.
- **Scalability**: New document types can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.
- **Maintainability**: The creation logic is centralized, making it easier to manage and update.

#### Code Example

Let's implement a simple document creation system using the Factory Method pattern.

```java
// Abstract Product
interface Document {
    void open();
    void close();
}

// Concrete Product 1
class TextDocument implements Document {
    @Override
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening text document.");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Closing text document.");
    }
}

// Concrete Product 2
class SpreadsheetDocument implements Document {
    @Override
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening spreadsheet document.");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Closing spreadsheet document.");
    }
}

// Creator
abstract class Application {
    public void newDocument() {
        Document doc = createDocument();
        doc.open();
    }

    // Factory Method
    protected abstract Document createDocument();
}

// Concrete Creator 1
class TextApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    protected Document createDocument() {
        return new TextDocument();
    }
}

// Concrete Creator 2
class SpreadsheetApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    protected Document createDocument() {
        return new SpreadsheetDocument();
    }
}

// Client code
public class FactoryMethodDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application app = new TextApplication();
        app.newDocument();

        app = new SpreadsheetApplication();
        app.newDocument();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Application` class defines the `createDocument` method, which is implemented by `TextApplication` and `SpreadsheetApplication` to create `TextDocument` and `SpreadsheetDocument`, respectively. This approach allows the application to support new document types by simply adding new subclasses.

### Benefits of the Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern offers several benefits that make it a valuable tool in software development:

- **Decoupling**: By delegating object creation to subclasses, the Factory Method pattern promotes loose coupling between classes. This decoupling makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
- **Extensibility**: The pattern adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, allowing new product types to be added without modifying existing code. This extensibility is crucial in systems that need to evolve over time.
- **Reusability**: The creation logic is encapsulated within the factory method, making it reusable across different parts of the application. This reusability reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability.
- **Consistency**: The pattern provides a consistent way to create objects, ensuring that all objects are created in a controlled and predictable manner.

### Visualizing the Factory Method Pattern

To better understand the Factory Method pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Dialog {
        +renderWindow()
        #createButton() Button
    }
    class WindowsDialog {
        +createButton() Button
    }
    class WebDialog {
        +createButton() Button
    }
    class Button {
        +render()
        +onClick()
    }
    class WindowsButton {
        +render()
        +onClick()
    }
    class HTMLButton {
        +render()
        +onClick()
    }
    Dialog <|-- WindowsDialog
    Dialog <|-- WebDialog
    Button <|-- WindowsButton
    Button <|-- HTMLButton
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Dialog` class and its subclasses, as well as the `Button` interface and its implementations. The `Dialog` class defines the `createButton` method, which is implemented by `WindowsDialog` and `WebDialog` to create `WindowsButton` and `HTMLButton`, respectively.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Factory Method pattern, try modifying the code examples provided:

1. **Add a New Button Type**: Extend the dialog example by adding a new button type, such as a `MacButton`. Implement the necessary classes and methods to support this new button type.
2. **Create a New Document Type**: Extend the document example by adding a new document type, such as a `PresentationDocument`. Implement the necessary classes and methods to support this new document type.
3. **Experiment with Different Scenarios**: Consider other scenarios where the Factory Method pattern might be applicable, such as creating different types of vehicles or animals. Implement these scenarios using the pattern.
