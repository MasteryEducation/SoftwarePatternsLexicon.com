## 3.3.1 Implementing Factory Method in Java

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create or when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.

### Understanding the Factory Method Pattern

Before diving into the implementation, let's break down the key components of the Factory Method pattern:

1. **Product**: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the type of objects the factory method will create.
2. **ConcreteProduct**: These are the classes that implement the Product interface.
3. **Creator**: This is an abstract class or interface that declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product.
4. **ConcreteCreator**: These are the subclasses that implement the factory method to create and return instances of ConcreteProduct.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's walk through the implementation of the Factory Method pattern in Java with a practical example. We'll create a simple application to manage different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF).

#### Step 1: Define the Product Interface

First, define the `Product` interface. This interface will be implemented by all concrete products.

```java
// Product.java
public interface Document {
    void open();
    void close();
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Products

Next, implement the concrete products that will implement the `Document` interface.

```java
// WordDocument.java
public class WordDocument implements Document {
    @Override
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening Word document...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Closing Word document...");
    }
}

// PdfDocument.java
public class PdfDocument implements Document {
    @Override
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening PDF document...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Closing PDF document...");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Creator Abstract Class

Now, define the `Creator` abstract class, which declares the factory method. This method will return an object of type `Document`.

```java
// DocumentCreator.java
public abstract class DocumentCreator {
    public abstract Document createDocument();

    public void openDocument() {
        Document doc = createDocument();
        doc.open();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement Concrete Creators

Implement the concrete creators that override the factory method to instantiate specific product objects.

```java
// WordDocumentCreator.java
public class WordDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
    @Override
    public Document createDocument() {
        return new WordDocument();
    }
}

// PdfDocumentCreator.java
public class PdfDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
    @Override
    public Document createDocument() {
        return new PdfDocument();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Client Code

Finally, use the factory method in the client code to create and use different types of documents without knowing their concrete classes.

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DocumentCreator creator = new WordDocumentCreator();
        creator.openDocument();

        creator = new PdfDocumentCreator();
        creator.openDocument();
    }
}
```

### Role of Polymorphism

In this pattern, polymorphism plays a crucial role in decoupling the client code from the specific implementations of the product objects. The client interacts with the abstract `Document` interface, which allows it to work with any concrete product without knowing its specific type. This decoupling enhances flexibility and maintainability, as new product types can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

### Benefits of the Factory Method Pattern

- **Flexibility**: The Factory Method pattern allows the client code to work with different products without knowing their concrete classes.
- **Scalability**: New product types can be added easily by creating new concrete creator classes.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to product creation logic are confined to the creator classes, reducing the impact on client code.

### Best Practices

- **Program to Interfaces**: Always program to the `Product` interface rather than concrete classes to leverage polymorphism.
- **Use Abstract Classes for Creators**: Define the creator as an abstract class if you want to provide a default implementation for some methods.
- **Keep Factory Methods Simple**: The factory method should only be responsible for creating product objects. Avoid adding complex logic within it.

### Visualizing the Factory Method Pattern

To better understand the relationships between the components of the Factory Method pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Document {
        <<interface>>
        +open()
        +close()
    }

    class WordDocument {
        +open()
        +close()
    }

    class PdfDocument {
        +open()
        +close()
    }

    class DocumentCreator {
        +createDocument() Document
        +openDocument()
    }

    class WordDocumentCreator {
        +createDocument() Document
    }

    class PdfDocumentCreator {
        +createDocument() Document
    }

    Document <|-- WordDocument
    Document <|-- PdfDocument
    DocumentCreator <|-- WordDocumentCreator
    DocumentCreator <|-- PdfDocumentCreator
    DocumentCreator o-- Document
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Factory Method pattern by extending the example above:

- **Add a New Document Type**: Create a new document type, such as `ExcelDocument`, and implement the necessary classes.
- **Modify the Client Code**: Update the client code to use the new document type and observe how the pattern facilitates this change.
- **Refactor the Creator Class**: Try refactoring the `DocumentCreator` class to include additional methods that might be common across all document creators.
