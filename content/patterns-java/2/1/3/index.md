## 2.1.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, which are essential for creating robust and maintainable software. LSP is named after Barbara Liskov, who introduced the concept in a 1987 conference keynote address. The principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without altering the desirable properties of the program, such as correctness, task completion, and performance.

### Understanding Liskov Substitution Principle

The essence of LSP is that a subclass should enhance, rather than replace, the behavior of its superclass. This means that the subclass should adhere to the expected behavior of the superclass, ensuring that any instance of the subclass can be used wherever an instance of the superclass is expected.

#### Key Concepts

- **Preconditions**: Conditions that must be true before a method is executed. A subclass should not strengthen the preconditions of the methods it overrides.
- **Postconditions**: Conditions that must be true after a method is executed. A subclass should not weaken the postconditions of the methods it overrides.
- **Invariants**: Conditions that must always be true for an object. A subclass should maintain the invariants of the superclass.

### Role of LSP in Reliable Inheritance

LSP plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable inheritance hierarchies. By adhering to LSP, developers can create subclasses that are true extensions of their superclasses, maintaining the integrity and expected behavior of the system. This leads to more predictable and stable software, where changes in subclasses do not introduce unexpected behaviors.

### Violations of LSP

Violations of LSP occur when a subclass overrides methods in a way that is incompatible with the superclass. This can lead to unexpected behaviors and code fragility. Let's explore some common violations and how to avoid them.

#### Example of LSP Violation

Consider a simple example involving a `Rectangle` class and a `Square` class:

```java
class Rectangle {
    protected int width;
    protected int height;

    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
    @Override
    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = width; // Violation: Changes height when width is set
    }

    @Override
    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.width = height; // Violation: Changes width when height is set
        this.height = height;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Square` class violates LSP because it changes the behavior of the `setWidth` and `setHeight` methods. A `Square` is a specific type of `Rectangle`, but it does not adhere to the expected behavior of a `Rectangle`, where width and height can be set independently.

#### Consequences of Violating LSP

Violating LSP can lead to several issues:

- **Unexpected Behaviors**: Programs may behave unpredictably when subclasses do not adhere to the expected behavior of their superclasses.
- **Code Fragility**: Changes in subclasses can introduce bugs and require extensive testing to ensure that the program still functions correctly.
- **Reduced Reusability**: Violating LSP can make it difficult to reuse code, as subclasses may not be suitable replacements for their superclasses.

### Ensuring Adherence to LSP

To ensure adherence to LSP, follow these best practices:

- **Maintain Method Contracts**: Ensure that subclasses do not alter the method contracts of their superclasses. This includes maintaining preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.
- **Use Interfaces Wisely**: Design interfaces that define the expected behavior of classes. Subclasses should implement these interfaces without altering the expected behavior.
- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: In some cases, composition may be a better choice than inheritance, as it allows for greater flexibility and adherence to LSP.

#### Proper Adherence to LSP

Let's modify the previous example to adhere to LSP by using composition instead of inheritance:

```java
class Rectangle {
    private int width;
    private int height;

    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Square {
    private Rectangle rectangle;

    public Square(int side) {
        this.rectangle = new Rectangle(side, side);
    }

    public void setSide(int side) {
        rectangle.setWidth(side);
        rectangle.setHeight(side);
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return rectangle.getArea();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Square` class uses composition to maintain the expected behavior of a `Rectangle` while providing the specific functionality of a square.

### LSP and Interface Segregation

LSP is closely related to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), which states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. By adhering to LSP and ISP, developers can create robust inheritance structures that are easy to understand and maintain.

### Encouraging Best Practices

To ensure that subclasses extend and enhance, rather than replace, the behavior of their superclasses, consider the following practices:

- **Design for Extension**: Design classes with extension in mind, allowing subclasses to add functionality without altering existing behavior.
- **Use Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Define clear contracts for subclasses to implement, ensuring adherence to expected behavior.
- **Test Substitutions**: Regularly test subclasses to ensure they can be substituted for their superclasses without affecting program correctness.

### Visualizing Liskov Substitution Principle

To better understand LSP, let's visualize the relationship between a superclass and its subclasses:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Rectangle {
        - int width
        - int height
        + setWidth(int)
        + setHeight(int)
        + getArea() int
    }

    class Square {
        - Rectangle rectangle
        + setSide(int)
        + getArea() int
    }

    Rectangle <|-- Square
```

This diagram illustrates how the `Square` class uses composition to adhere to LSP, maintaining the expected behavior of a `Rectangle`.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by making the following modifications:

1. **Add a New Shape**: Create a `Circle` class that adheres to LSP, using composition to maintain expected behavior.
2. **Test Substitution**: Write a test case that verifies the substitution of a `Square` for a `Rectangle` without affecting program correctness.
3. **Explore Violations**: Modify the `Square` class to violate LSP and observe the consequences in your test cases.

### Conclusion

The Liskov Substitution Principle is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented design that ensures reliable inheritance hierarchies. By adhering to LSP, developers can create subclasses that enhance, rather than replace, the behavior of their superclasses, leading to more robust and maintainable software. Remember to maintain method contracts, use interfaces wisely, and favor composition over inheritance when necessary. As you continue to explore design patterns and principles, keep LSP in mind to create software that is both flexible and reliable.
