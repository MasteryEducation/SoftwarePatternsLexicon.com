## 2.2 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

In the realm of software engineering, the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle stands as a cornerstone for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. The essence of DRY is simple yet profound: avoid code duplication. By adhering to this principle, developers can significantly reduce the risk of errors, lower maintenance costs, and improve the overall quality of software projects.

### Understanding the DRY Principle

The DRY principle, coined by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book "The Pragmatic Programmer," emphasizes that "every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." This means that any logic, data, or configuration should be defined once and reused wherever necessary.

#### Why Redundancy is Detrimental

Redundancy in code can lead to several issues:

- **Increased Maintenance Effort**: When the same logic is duplicated across multiple locations, any change requires updating each instance, increasing the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies.
- **Higher Likelihood of Bugs**: Duplicated code can lead to discrepancies if not all instances are updated consistently, resulting in bugs that are difficult to trace.
- **Reduced Readability**: Code duplication can clutter the codebase, making it harder for developers to understand and navigate the system.

### Negative Impacts of Code Duplication

To illustrate the negative impacts of code duplication, consider the following Java example:

```java
public class OrderProcessor {

    public void processOnlineOrder(Order order) {
        if (order.isValid()) {
            // Calculate total
            double total = order.getQuantity() * order.getPrice();
            // Apply discount
            total -= order.getDiscount();
            // Process payment
            processPayment(order, total);
        }
    }

    public void processInStoreOrder(Order order) {
        if (order.isValid()) {
            // Calculate total
            double total = order.getQuantity() * order.getPrice();
            // Apply discount
            total -= order.getDiscount();
            // Process payment
            processPayment(order, total);
        }
    }

    private void processPayment(Order order, double total) {
        // Payment processing logic
    }
}
```

In this example, the logic for calculating the total and applying a discount is duplicated in both `processOnlineOrder` and `processInStoreOrder` methods. This redundancy can lead to maintenance challenges and potential errors if changes are needed.

### Refactoring to Eliminate Redundancy

To adhere to the DRY principle, we can refactor the code by extracting the duplicated logic into a separate method:

```java
public class OrderProcessor {

    public void processOnlineOrder(Order order) {
        double total = calculateTotal(order);
        processPayment(order, total);
    }

    public void processInStoreOrder(Order order) {
        double total = calculateTotal(order);
        processPayment(order, total);
    }

    private double calculateTotal(Order order) {
        double total = order.getQuantity() * order.getPrice();
        total -= order.getDiscount();
        return total;
    }

    private void processPayment(Order order, double total) {
        // Payment processing logic
    }
}
```

By extracting the `calculateTotal` method, we have eliminated redundancy, making the code more maintainable and less error-prone.

### Techniques to Adhere to DRY

#### 1. Abstraction

Abstraction involves creating a general concept that can be used to represent multiple specific instances. In Java, this can be achieved through interfaces and abstract classes.

```java
public abstract class OrderProcessor {

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        double total = calculateTotal(order);
        processPayment(order, total);
    }

    protected abstract double calculateTotal(Order order);

    private void processPayment(Order order, double total) {
        // Payment processing logic
    }
}
```

#### 2. Method Extraction

Method extraction is a refactoring technique where common code is moved into a separate method. This not only reduces duplication but also improves readability and reusability.

#### 3. Utilizing Inheritance and Composition

Inheritance allows you to define a base class with common functionality that can be extended by subclasses. Composition involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones, promoting code reuse.

```java
public class DiscountCalculator {

    public double calculate(Order order) {
        return order.getQuantity() * order.getPrice() - order.getDiscount();
    }
}

public class OrderProcessor {

    private DiscountCalculator discountCalculator = new DiscountCalculator();

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        double total = discountCalculator.calculate(order);
        processPayment(order, total);
    }

    private void processPayment(Order order, double total) {
        // Payment processing logic
    }
}
```

### Balancing DRY and Readability

While the DRY principle is crucial for maintainability, it's essential to balance it with code readability. In some cases, minor duplication might be acceptable if it improves clarity. For example, repeating a small piece of logic in two different contexts might make the code easier to understand than abstracting it into a separate method.

### DRY Beyond Code

The DRY principle extends beyond code to documentation and processes. Consistent documentation ensures that information is not repeated unnecessarily, reducing the risk of discrepancies. Similarly, DRY processes promote efficiency and consistency across the project.

### Regular Code Reviews

Encourage the practice of regularly reviewing code to identify and refactor duplications. Code reviews are an excellent opportunity to spot redundancy and suggest improvements.

### Java-Specific Tips

- **Utility Classes**: Use utility classes to encapsulate common functionality that can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Common Libraries**: Leverage common libraries and frameworks that provide reusable components, reducing the need to write duplicate code.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of the DRY principle, try refactoring the following code snippet to eliminate duplication:

```java
public class ReportGenerator {

    public void generateSalesReport() {
        // Fetch data
        List<Sale> sales = fetchSalesData();
        // Format data
        String formattedData = formatData(sales);
        // Print report
        printReport(formattedData);
    }

    public void generateInventoryReport() {
        // Fetch data
        List<Inventory> inventory = fetchInventoryData();
        // Format data
        String formattedData = formatData(inventory);
        // Print report
        printReport(formattedData);
    }

    private List<Sale> fetchSalesData() {
        // Fetch sales data logic
    }

    private List<Inventory> fetchInventoryData() {
        // Fetch inventory data logic
    }

    private String formatData(Object data) {
        // Format data logic
    }

    private void printReport(String data) {
        // Print report logic
    }
}
```

### Visualizing DRY Principle

To better understand how the DRY principle can be applied, let's visualize the refactoring process using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OrderProcessor {
        +void processOrder(Order order)
        -double calculateTotal(Order order)
        -void processPayment(Order order, double total)
    }
    class DiscountCalculator {
        +double calculate(Order order)
    }
    OrderProcessor --> DiscountCalculator
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between `OrderProcessor` and `DiscountCalculator`, showing how composition can be used to adhere to the DRY principle.
