## 14.3.1 Content-Based Router

### Introduction

In the realm of enterprise integration patterns, the **Content-Based Router** stands out as a pivotal design pattern that facilitates the dynamic routing of messages based on their content. This pattern is instrumental in scenarios where messages need to be directed to different processing channels depending on specific criteria extracted from the message itself. By leveraging this pattern, developers can create flexible and maintainable systems that adapt to varying message formats and processing requirements.

### Intent

- **Description**: The Content-Based Router pattern is designed to route messages to different channels based on the content of the message. It inspects the message and applies routing logic to determine the appropriate destination channel.

### Also Known As

- **Alternate Names**: Content-Based Dispatcher

### Motivation

In complex systems, messages often need to be processed differently based on their content. For instance, an order processing system might route high-priority orders to a fast-track processing channel, while standard orders follow a regular processing path. The Content-Based Router pattern provides a mechanism to implement such conditional routing logic efficiently.

### Applicability

- **Guidelines**: Use the Content-Based Router pattern when:
  - Messages need to be routed to different destinations based on their content.
  - The system requires flexibility to adapt to new message types or routing rules.
  - You need to decouple message producers from consumers, allowing for independent evolution.

### Structure

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Message Source] -->|Message| B[Content-Based Router];
    B -->|Condition 1| C[Channel 1];
    B -->|Condition 2| D[Channel 2];
    B -->|Condition N| E[Channel N];
```

- **Caption**: The diagram illustrates the Content-Based Router pattern, where messages are routed to different channels based on evaluated conditions.

### Participants

- **Message Source**: The originator of the message.
- **Content-Based Router**: Inspects the message content and applies routing logic.
- **Channels**: Different destinations where messages are routed based on conditions.

### Collaborations

- **Interactions**: The Content-Based Router evaluates the message content using predicates or expressions and routes the message to the appropriate channel.

### Consequences

- **Analysis**: 
  - **Benefits**: 
    - Flexibility in routing logic.
    - Decoupling of message producers and consumers.
    - Simplified maintenance and scalability.
  - **Drawbacks**: 
    - Potential performance overhead due to content inspection.
    - Dependency on message format consistency.

### Implementation

#### Implementation Guidelines

To implement a Content-Based Router in Java, you can use frameworks like Apache Camel or Spring Integration, which provide robust support for message routing based on content.

#### Sample Code Snippets

##### Using Apache Camel

Apache Camel is a powerful integration framework that simplifies the implementation of enterprise integration patterns, including the Content-Based Router.

```java
import org.apache.camel.CamelContext;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultCamelContext;

public class ContentBasedRouterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
        context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() {
                from("direct:start")
                    .choice()
                        .when(simple("${body} contains 'urgent'"))
                            .to("direct:urgent")
                        .when(simple("${body} contains 'standard'"))
                            .to("direct:standard")
                        .otherwise()
                            .to("direct:other");
            }
        });

        context.start();
        // Send test messages
        context.createProducerTemplate().sendBody("direct:start", "This is an urgent message");
        context.createProducerTemplate().sendBody("direct:start", "This is a standard message");
        context.stop();
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**: This example demonstrates a simple Content-Based Router using Apache Camel. Messages are routed to different channels based on their content, evaluated using simple expressions.

##### Using Spring Integration

Spring Integration provides a comprehensive framework for building message-driven applications, including support for content-based routing.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.integration.annotation.ServiceActivator;
import org.springframework.integration.channel.DirectChannel;
import org.springframework.integration.router.PayloadTypeRouter;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;

@Configuration
public class ContentBasedRouterConfig {

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel inputChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel urgentChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel standardChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "inputChannel")
    public PayloadTypeRouter router() {
        PayloadTypeRouter router = new PayloadTypeRouter();
        router.setChannelMapping(String.class.getName(), "urgentChannel");
        router.setChannelMapping(Integer.class.getName(), "standardChannel");
        return router;
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**: This Spring Integration example uses a `PayloadTypeRouter` to route messages based on their payload type. The router directs messages to different channels depending on whether the payload is a `String` or an `Integer`.

### Sample Use Cases

- **Real-world Scenarios**:
  - **Order Processing**: Route orders to different processing channels based on priority or type.
  - **Log Management**: Direct log messages to different storage systems based on severity.
  - **Notification Systems**: Send notifications to different channels (e.g., email, SMS) based on user preferences.

### Related Patterns

- **Connections**: The Content-Based Router pattern is often used in conjunction with other routing patterns such as [14.3.2 Message Filter]({{< ref "/patterns-java/14/3/2" >}} "Message Filter") and [14.3.3 Dynamic Router]({{< ref "/patterns-java/14/3/3" >}} "Dynamic Router").

### Known Uses

- **Examples in Libraries or Frameworks**: 
  - **Apache Camel**: Widely used in enterprise applications for implementing content-based routing.
  - **Spring Integration**: Provides comprehensive support for message routing and transformation.

### Performance Considerations

When implementing a Content-Based Router, consider the following performance aspects:

- **Message Inspection Overhead**: Inspecting message content can introduce latency, especially with large or complex messages. Optimize predicates and expressions to minimize processing time.
- **Message Format Dependencies**: Ensure consistent message formats to avoid routing errors. Consider using a schema validation mechanism to enforce format consistency.

### Exercises

1. **Modify the Apache Camel example** to route messages based on additional criteria, such as message length or specific keywords.
2. **Implement a Content-Based Router** using Spring Integration that routes messages to different channels based on custom header values.

### Conclusion

The Content-Based Router pattern is a powerful tool for building flexible and maintainable message-driven systems. By leveraging frameworks like Apache Camel and Spring Integration, developers can implement sophisticated routing logic that adapts to changing business requirements. As you explore this pattern, consider the performance implications and strive for efficient message inspection and routing strategies.
