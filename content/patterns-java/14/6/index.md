public interface TradingAPI {
    void fetchData();
}

public class ExternalAPIAdapter implements TradingAPI {
    private ExternalAPI externalAPI;

    public ExternalAPIAdapter(ExternalAPI externalAPI) {
        this.externalAPI = externalAPI;
    }

    @Override
    public void fetchData() {
        externalAPI.getData(); // Adapts the external API call to the TradingAPI interface
    }
}
```

#### Outcomes and Benefits

```java
// Example of Observer Pattern for Data Consistency Testing
public class PatientDataObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(Observable o, Object arg) {
        // Automated test to verify data consistency
        System.out.println("Patient data updated, running consistency tests...");
    }
}
```

#### Outcomes and Benefits

The use of these patterns resulted in:

- **Increased Data Integrity**: The Observer Pattern ensured real-time verification of data changes, maintaining data integrity.

- **Proxy Pattern**: Utilized to simulate secure payment gateways during testing, ensuring realistic test scenarios.

```java
// Example of Proxy Pattern for Payment Gateway Testing
public class PaymentGatewayProxy implements PaymentGateway {
    private RealPaymentGateway realPaymentGateway;

    public PaymentGatewayProxy(RealPaymentGateway realPaymentGateway) {
        this.realPaymentGateway = realPaymentGateway;
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment() {
        // Simulate payment processing for testing
        System.out.println("Processing payment through proxy...");
        realPaymentGateway.processPayment();
    }
}
```

#### Outcomes and Benefits

The application of these patterns led to:
