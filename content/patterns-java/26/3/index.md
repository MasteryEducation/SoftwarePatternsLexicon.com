## 26.3 Composition Over Inheritance in Practice

In the realm of object-oriented programming, the debate between composition and inheritance is a fundamental one. Both are powerful tools for code reuse, but they serve different purposes and have distinct implications for the design and maintainability of software systems. This section delves into the practice of preferring composition over inheritance, explaining how it leads to more flexible and maintainable code structures.

### Understanding Composition and Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors. It allows for the creation of a class hierarchy, where subclasses extend the functionality of their parent classes. While inheritance can be a powerful tool for code reuse, it can also lead to rigid and tightly coupled systems if overused.

**Composition**, on the other hand, involves building classes by combining objects of other classes. Instead of inheriting behavior, a class achieves functionality by delegating tasks to its composed objects. This approach promotes loose coupling and greater flexibility, as it allows for the dynamic composition of behaviors at runtime.

### Drawbacks of Excessive Inheritance Hierarchies

Excessive use of inheritance can lead to several issues:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Subclasses are tightly coupled to their parent classes, making changes in the superclass potentially disruptive to all subclasses.

2. **Fragile Base Class Problem**: Changes to the base class can inadvertently affect all derived classes, leading to unexpected behaviors.

3. **Limited Flexibility**: Inheritance is static and determined at compile-time, making it difficult to change behaviors dynamically.

4. **Complex Hierarchies**: Deep inheritance hierarchies can become complex and difficult to manage, leading to code that is hard to understand and maintain.

### Composition as a Flexible Alternative

Composition offers a more flexible alternative to inheritance by allowing objects to be composed of other objects. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Loose Coupling**: By delegating responsibilities to composed objects, classes remain loosely coupled and easier to modify independently.

- **Dynamic Behavior**: Composition allows for behaviors to be changed or extended at runtime, offering greater flexibility.

- **Simplified Hierarchies**: By avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies, composition leads to simpler and more maintainable code structures.

### Practical Examples of Composition Over Inheritance

Let's explore some practical examples where composition can replace inheritance.

#### Example 1: Using Composition to Replace Inheritance

Consider a scenario where we have different types of vehicles, such as cars and trucks, each with specific behaviors like driving and honking. Using inheritance, we might create a class hierarchy like this:

```java
class Vehicle {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void honk() {
        System.out.println("Car honking");
    }
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
    void honk() {
        System.out.println("Truck honking");
    }
}
```

This approach can lead to code duplication and a rigid structure. Instead, we can use composition:

```java
interface DriveBehavior {
    void drive();
}

interface HonkBehavior {
    void honk();
}

class Vehicle {
    private DriveBehavior driveBehavior;
    private HonkBehavior honkBehavior;

    public Vehicle(DriveBehavior driveBehavior, HonkBehavior honkBehavior) {
        this.driveBehavior = driveBehavior;
        this.honkBehavior = honkBehavior;
    }

    void performDrive() {
        driveBehavior.drive();
    }

    void performHonk() {
        honkBehavior.honk();
    }
}

class CarDriveBehavior implements DriveBehavior {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car driving");
    }
}

class CarHonkBehavior implements HonkBehavior {
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Car honking");
    }
}

class TruckHonkBehavior implements HonkBehavior {
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Truck honking");
    }
}

// Usage
Vehicle car = new Vehicle(new CarDriveBehavior(), new CarHonkBehavior());
car.performDrive();
car.performHonk();

Vehicle truck = new Vehicle(new CarDriveBehavior(), new TruckHonkBehavior());
truck.performDrive();
truck.performHonk();
```

In this example, behaviors are encapsulated in separate classes, allowing for flexible combinations and easy modifications.

### Design Patterns Promoting Composition

Several design patterns inherently promote the use of composition over inheritance. Let's explore a few of them:

#### Strategy Pattern

- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- **Structure**:

    ```mermaid
    classDiagram
        Context --> Strategy : uses
        Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
        Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB

        class Context {
            - strategy: Strategy
            + setStrategy(Strategy)
            + executeStrategy()
        }

        class Strategy {
            <<interface>>
            + execute()
        }

        class ConcreteStrategyA {
            + execute()
        }

        class ConcreteStrategyB {
            + execute()
        }
    ```

- **Example**: The Strategy pattern is used in the example above to encapsulate driving and honking behaviors.

#### Decorator Pattern

- **Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- **Structure**:

    ```mermaid
    classDiagram
        Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
        Component <|-- Decorator
        Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorA
        Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorB

        class Component {
            <<interface>>
            + operation()
        }

        class ConcreteComponent {
            + operation()
        }

        class Decorator {
            - component: Component
            + operation()
        }

        class ConcreteDecoratorA {
            + operation()
        }

        class ConcreteDecoratorB {
            + operation()
        }
    ```

- **Example**: Use the Decorator pattern to add features to a graphical user interface component without modifying its code.

#### Composite Pattern

- **Intent**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **Structure**:

    ```mermaid
    classDiagram
        Component <|-- Leaf
        Component <|-- Composite

        class Component {
            <<interface>>
            + operation()
        }

        class Leaf {
            + operation()
        }

        class Composite {
            + add(Component)
            + remove(Component)
            + operation()
        }
    ```

- **Example**: The Composite pattern is useful for building complex UI components that consist of nested elements.

### Guidelines for Choosing Between Composition and Inheritance

When deciding between composition and inheritance, consider the following guidelines:

- **Use Inheritance** when:
  - You have a clear "is-a" relationship.
  - The behavior is static and unlikely to change.
  - You want to leverage polymorphism and shared behavior.

- **Use Composition** when:
  - You need flexibility and dynamic behavior changes.
  - You want to avoid tight coupling and complex hierarchies.
  - You aim to reuse behavior across unrelated classes.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while inheritance is a powerful tool in object-oriented programming, it is not always the best choice for achieving code reuse and flexibility. Composition offers a more flexible and maintainable approach, allowing for dynamic behavior changes and promoting loose coupling. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, developers can make informed decisions that lead to robust and adaptable software systems.

### Key Takeaways

- Composition provides greater flexibility and maintainability than inheritance.
- Design patterns like Strategy, Decorator, and Composite promote composition.
- Choose composition for dynamic behavior and loose coupling, and inheritance for static behavior and polymorphism.

### Exercises

1. Refactor a class hierarchy in your project using composition.
2. Implement a simple application using the Strategy pattern to swap algorithms at runtime.
3. Use the Decorator pattern to add features to a class without modifying its code.
