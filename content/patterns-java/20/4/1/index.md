## 20.4.1 Custom Annotations

### Introduction to Annotations in Java

Annotations in Java serve as a powerful mechanism for adding metadata to Java code. They provide a way to associate information with program elements such as classes, methods, fields, and parameters. This metadata can be processed by the compiler or at runtime, enabling developers to implement custom behaviors, enforce coding standards, and facilitate code generation.

Java annotations were introduced in Java 5, and since then, they have become an integral part of the Java programming language. They are widely used in frameworks like Spring and Hibernate to configure components and manage dependencies without extensive XML configuration.

### Defining Custom Annotations

To define a custom annotation in Java, use the `@interface` keyword. This keyword is used to declare an annotation type, which can then be applied to various program elements. Here is a simple example of defining a custom annotation:

```java
// Define a custom annotation
public @interface MyCustomAnnotation {
    String value();
    int count() default 1;
}
```

In this example, `MyCustomAnnotation` is a custom annotation with two elements: `value` and `count`. The `value` element is mandatory, while `count` has a default value of 1.

### Meta-Annotations: `@Retention`, `@Target`, and `@Inherited`

Meta-annotations are annotations that apply to other annotations. They provide additional information about how the annotation should be used. The three most commonly used meta-annotations are `@Retention`, `@Target`, and `@Inherited`.

#### `@Retention`

The `@Retention` meta-annotation specifies how long the annotation should be retained. It can take one of three values from the `RetentionPolicy` enumeration:

- `SOURCE`: The annotation is retained only in the source code and discarded during compilation.
- `CLASS`: The annotation is retained in the compiled class files but not available at runtime.
- `RUNTIME`: The annotation is retained at runtime and can be accessed via reflection.

Example:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface RuntimeAnnotation {
    String description();
}
```

#### `@Target`

The `@Target` meta-annotation specifies the kinds of program elements to which the annotation can be applied. It takes an array of `ElementType` values, such as `TYPE`, `METHOD`, `FIELD`, etc.

Example:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD})
public @interface MethodOrFieldAnnotation {
    String info();
}
```

#### `@Inherited`

The `@Inherited` meta-annotation indicates that an annotation type is automatically inherited. If a class is annotated with an inherited annotation, its subclasses will also inherit the annotation.

Example:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.Inherited;

@Inherited
public @interface InheritedAnnotation {
    String author();
}
```

### Creating and Applying Custom Annotations

Let's create a custom annotation and apply it to a Java class. We will define an annotation called `Task` to mark methods that represent tasks in a project management application.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;

// Define the Task annotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Task {
    String description();
    String assignee();
    int priority() default 1;
}

// Apply the Task annotation
public class Project {

    @Task(description = "Implement login feature", assignee = "Alice", priority = 2)
    public void loginFeature() {
        // Implementation code
    }

    @Task(description = "Write unit tests", assignee = "Bob")
    public void writeTests() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Task` annotation is applied to two methods in the `Project` class. Each method is annotated with metadata about the task it represents, such as a description, assignee, and priority.

### Runtime vs. Compile-Time Retention Policies

The retention policy of an annotation determines when the annotation is available. Understanding the difference between runtime and compile-time retention policies is crucial for effectively using annotations.

#### Runtime Retention

Annotations with `RUNTIME` retention are available at runtime and can be accessed using reflection. This is useful for scenarios where you need to dynamically inspect or modify behavior based on annotations.

Example:

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class AnnotationProcessor {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (Method method : Project.class.getDeclaredMethods()) {
            if (method.isAnnotationPresent(Task.class)) {
                Task task = method.getAnnotation(Task.class);
                System.out.println("Task: " + task.description() + ", Assignee: " + task.assignee());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `AnnotationProcessor` class uses reflection to inspect methods in the `Project` class and print information about each `Task` annotation.

#### Compile-Time Retention

Annotations with `SOURCE` or `CLASS` retention are not available at runtime. They are typically used for compile-time processing, such as generating code or enforcing coding standards.

### Benefits of Using Annotations

Annotations offer several benefits for Java developers:

- **Code Clarity**: Annotations provide a clear and concise way to express metadata, reducing the need for verbose configuration files.
- **Tooling Support**: Many IDEs and build tools support annotations, enabling features like code generation, validation, and documentation.
- **Decoupling**: Annotations help decouple configuration from code logic, making it easier to maintain and modify applications.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

Custom annotations are widely used in various Java frameworks and libraries. Here are some practical applications:

- **Dependency Injection**: Frameworks like Spring use annotations to manage dependencies and configure beans.
- **Validation**: Annotations can be used to define validation rules for data models, as seen in the Java Bean Validation API.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming**: Annotations can mark methods for cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

While annotations are powerful, they can introduce complexity if not used carefully. Here are some best practices:

- **Avoid Overuse**: Use annotations judiciously to avoid cluttering code with excessive metadata.
- **Document Annotations**: Provide clear documentation for custom annotations to ensure they are used correctly.
- **Consider Performance**: Be mindful of the performance impact of runtime annotations, especially in performance-critical applications.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Create a Custom Annotation**: Define a custom annotation called `@Review` with elements for reviewer name, review date, and comments. Apply it to a method and use reflection to print the review details.

2. **Annotation Processor**: Implement a simple annotation processor that scans a package for classes annotated with a custom annotation and generates a report.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

- Annotations provide a way to add metadata to Java code, enhancing code clarity and tooling support.
- Custom annotations are defined using the `@interface` keyword and can include elements with default values.
- Meta-annotations like `@Retention`, `@Target`, and `@Inherited` control how and where annotations are used.
- Annotations can be processed at compile-time or runtime, each with its own use cases and benefits.
- Use annotations judiciously to maintain code readability and performance.

### Reflection and Application

Consider how custom annotations can simplify configuration and enhance the readability of your Java projects. Reflect on the potential for annotations to automate repetitive tasks and enforce coding standards.
