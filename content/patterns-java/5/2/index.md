## 5.2 Lambda Expressions and Method References

### Introduction

Java 8 introduced lambda expressions and method references, marking a significant shift towards functional programming paradigms. These features allow developers to write more concise and expressive code, particularly when dealing with collections and streams. This section delves into the syntax and usage of lambda expressions and method references, illustrating their impact on design patterns and best practices in modern Java development.

### Understanding Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent a single method interface (functional interface) using an expression. They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument or code as data, which is a key aspect of functional programming.

#### Syntax of Lambda Expressions

The syntax of a lambda expression is straightforward:

```java
(parameters) -> expression
```

Or, if the body contains multiple statements:

```java
(parameters) -> { statements; }
```

**Example:**

Consider a simple example where a lambda expression is used to implement a functional interface:

```java
// Functional interface
interface MathOperation {
    int operation(int a, int b);
}

// Lambda expression
MathOperation addition = (a, b) -> a + b;
```

In this example, the lambda expression `(a, b) -> a + b` implements the `operation` method of the `MathOperation` interface.

#### Comparing Anonymous Inner Classes with Lambda Expressions

Before Java 8, anonymous inner classes were commonly used to implement functional interfaces. Lambda expressions provide a more concise alternative.

**Anonymous Inner Class Example:**

```java
Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running...");
    }
};
```

**Equivalent Lambda Expression:**

```java
Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Running...");
```

The lambda expression significantly reduces boilerplate code, making it easier to read and maintain.

### Method References

Method references are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. They provide a way to refer to methods without executing them. Method references can be of four types:

1. **Reference to a Static Method:**

   ```java
   // Static method reference
   Function<String, Integer> parseInt = Integer::parseInt;
   ```

2. **Reference to an Instance Method of a Particular Object:**

   ```java
   // Instance method reference
   String str = "Hello";
   Supplier<Integer> lengthSupplier = str::length;
   ```

3. **Reference to an Instance Method of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type:**

   ```java
   // Arbitrary object method reference
   Function<String, String> toUpperCase = String::toUpperCase;
   ```

4. **Reference to a Constructor:**

   ```java
   // Constructor reference
   Supplier<List<String>> listSupplier = ArrayList::new;
   ```

### Simplifying Code with Lambdas and Method References

Lambda expressions and method references simplify code, especially when working with collections and streams. They allow for more declarative programming, where you specify what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.

#### Using Lambdas in Collections

Consider sorting a list of strings:

**Before Java 8:**

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Adam", "Eve");
Collections.sort(names, new Comparator<String>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(String a, String b) {
        return a.compareTo(b);
    }
});
```

**With Lambda Expression:**

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Adam", "Eve");
names.sort((a, b) -> a.compareTo(b));
```

**With Method Reference:**

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Adam", "Eve");
names.sort(String::compareTo);
```

#### Using Lambdas in Streams

The Streams API, introduced in Java 8, works seamlessly with lambda expressions and method references to process collections in a functional style.

**Example:**

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Adam", "Eve");
names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
     .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Impact on Design Patterns

Lambda expressions and method references have a profound impact on implementing design patterns, particularly those that benefit from functional interfaces, such as Strategy and Command patterns.

#### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Lambdas simplify the implementation by reducing boilerplate code.

**Traditional Strategy Pattern:**

```java
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

class CreditCardStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

class ShoppingCart {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

**With Lambda Expressions:**

```java
class ShoppingCart {
    private Consumer<Integer> paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(Consumer<Integer> paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.accept(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
cart.setPaymentStrategy(amount -> System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card."));
cart.checkout(100);
```

#### Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Traditional Command Pattern:**

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class Light {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Light is ON");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Light is OFF");
    }
}

class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.on();
    }
}

class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

**With Lambda Expressions:**

```java
class RemoteControl {
    private Runnable command;

    public void setCommand(Runnable command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.run();
    }
}

// Usage
Light light = new Light();
RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();
remote.setCommand(light::on);
remote.pressButton();
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Use Lambdas for Functional Interfaces:** Always use lambda expressions to implement functional interfaces for cleaner and more readable code.
- **Prefer Method References:** When a lambda expression merely calls a method, prefer using a method reference for clarity.
- **Keep Lambdas Short:** Ensure lambda expressions are short and do not contain complex logic. If they become too complex, consider refactoring them into separate methods.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Overusing Lambdas:** Avoid overusing lambdas in scenarios where traditional methods provide better readability.
- **Complex Logic in Lambdas:** Do not include complex logic in lambda expressions, as it can make the code difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Type Inference Issues:** Be cautious of type inference issues, especially when dealing with generic types.

### Conclusion

They simplify code, enhance readability, and provide new ways to implement design patterns. By understanding and applying these features, developers can write more efficient and maintainable Java applications.
