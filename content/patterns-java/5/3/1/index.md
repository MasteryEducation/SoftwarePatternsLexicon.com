## 5.3.1 Implementing Command in Java

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of methods with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging the history of requests. It also provides support for undoable operations. In this section, we will delve into the implementation of the Command Pattern in Java, exploring its components, benefits, and practical applications.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

Before we dive into the implementation, let's break down the core components of the Command Pattern:

1. **Command Interface**: This defines the interface for executing an operation.
2. **Concrete Command**: This class implements the Command interface and defines the binding between the action and the Receiver.
3. **Receiver**: This is the component that knows how to perform the work needed to carry out the request.
4. **Invoker**: This class is responsible for executing the command.
5. **Client**: This creates and configures the ConcreteCommand with the appropriate Receiver.

### Step-by-Step Implementation in Java

Let's walk through the process of implementing the Command Pattern in Java with a practical example: a simple text editor that can perform operations like writing text, undoing the last operation, and redoing it.

#### Step 1: Define the Command Interface

The Command interface is the core of the Command Pattern. It declares a method for executing a command.

```java
// Command.java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}
```

Here, we have defined two methods: `execute()` to perform the action and `undo()` to revert it.

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Command Classes

Concrete Command classes implement the Command interface and define the relationship between the action and the Receiver.

```java
// WriteCommand.java
public class WriteCommand implements Command {
    private TextEditor textEditor;
    private String text;

    public WriteCommand(TextEditor textEditor, String text) {
        this.textEditor = textEditor;
        this.text = text;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        textEditor.write(text);
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        textEditor.undoWrite();
    }
}
```

In this example, `WriteCommand` is a Concrete Command that writes text to a `TextEditor`. It holds a reference to the `TextEditor` (Receiver) and the text to be written.

#### Step 3: Implement the Receiver

The Receiver is the component that performs the actual work. In our example, it's the `TextEditor`.

```java
// TextEditor.java
public class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder currentText = new StringBuilder();
    private Stack<String> history = new Stack<>();

    public void write(String text) {
        history.push(currentText.toString());
        currentText.append(text);
    }

    public void undoWrite() {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            currentText = new StringBuilder(history.pop());
        }
    }

    public String getText() {
        return currentText.toString();
    }
}
```

The `TextEditor` class maintains the current text and a history stack to support undo operations.

#### Step 4: Create the Invoker

The Invoker class is responsible for executing commands. It can store a command and execute it later.

```java
// TextEditorInvoker.java
public class TextEditorInvoker {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void executeCommand() {
        command.execute();
    }

    public void undoCommand() {
        command.undo();
    }
}
```

The `TextEditorInvoker` class holds a reference to a Command and can execute or undo it.

#### Step 5: Implement the Client

The Client is responsible for creating and configuring commands with the appropriate Receivers.

```java
// Client.java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor();
        Command writeCommand = new WriteCommand(textEditor, "Hello, World!");

        TextEditorInvoker invoker = new TextEditorInvoker();
        invoker.setCommand(writeCommand);

        invoker.executeCommand();
        System.out.println("Text after writing: " + textEditor.getText());

        invoker.undoCommand();
        System.out.println("Text after undo: " + textEditor.getText());
    }
}
```

In the `Client` class, we create a `TextEditor`, a `WriteCommand`, and a `TextEditorInvoker`. We then execute and undo the command, demonstrating the Command Pattern in action.

### Visualizing the Command Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Command Pattern, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    participant Command
    participant Receiver

    Client->>Invoker: setCommand(Command)
    Client->>Invoker: executeCommand()
    Invoker->>Command: execute()
    Command->>Receiver: performAction()
    Receiver-->>Command: actionPerformed()
    Command-->>Invoker: commandExecuted()
    Invoker-->>Client: commandExecuted()
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the Client, Invoker, Command, and Receiver. The Client sets a command in the Invoker, which then executes the command, causing the Receiver to perform the action.

### Benefits of the Command Pattern

The Command Pattern offers several advantages:

- **Decoupling**: It decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.
- **Flexibility**: Commands can be parameterized, queued, logged, and undone.
- **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code by adding new commands, such as `DeleteCommand` or `ReplaceCommand`. Implement these commands in a similar manner and observe how the Invoker can execute them without knowing their details.

### Knowledge Check

- **Question**: What are the main components of the Command Pattern?
- **Challenge**: Implement a `RedoCommand` for the text editor.

### Summary

In this section, we explored the Command Pattern, a powerful tool for encapsulating requests as objects in Java. By understanding and implementing this pattern, you can create flexible, maintainable, and extensible software systems. Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive applications. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
