## 5.3.3 Implementing Undo and Redo

In this section, we delve into the intricacies of implementing undo and redo functionality using the Command Pattern in Java. The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations, and supports undoable actions.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the operation being requested or the receiver of the request.

#### Key Components of the Command Pattern

1. **Command Interface**: Declares an interface for executing an operation.
2. **Concrete Command**: Defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action. Implements the Command interface by invoking the corresponding operation(s) on the Receiver.
3. **Client**: Creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.
4. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request.
5. **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.

### Implementing Undo and Redo

To implement undo and redo functionality, we need to maintain a history of commands that have been executed. This history allows us to reverse the effects of a command (undo) or reapply it (redo).

#### Storing Command History

The command history is typically maintained as a stack. When a command is executed, it is pushed onto the stack. To undo a command, we pop it from the stack and execute its undo operation. For redo functionality, we can maintain a separate stack or list to keep track of undone commands.

#### Code Example: Command Pattern with Undo and Redo

Let's explore a practical example of implementing undo and redo functionality in Java using the Command Pattern. We'll create a simple text editor application that supports typing text, undoing the last action, and redoing an undone action.

```java
// Command interface
interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}

// Receiver class
class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

    public void addText(String newText) {
        text.append(newText);
    }

    public void removeText(int length) {
        if (length <= text.length()) {
            text.delete(text.length() - length, text.length());
        }
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text.toString();
    }
}

// Concrete Command for adding text
class AddTextCommand implements Command {
    private TextEditor editor;
    private String textToAdd;

    public AddTextCommand(TextEditor editor, String textToAdd) {
        this.editor = editor;
        this.textToAdd = textToAdd;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        editor.addText(textToAdd);
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        editor.removeText(textToAdd.length());
    }
}

// Invoker class
class CommandManager {
    private Stack<Command> commandHistory = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Command> redoStack = new Stack<>();

    public void executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute();
        commandHistory.push(command);
        redoStack.clear(); // Clear redo stack on new command
    }

    public void undo() {
        if (!commandHistory.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = commandHistory.pop();
            command.undo();
            redoStack.push(command);
        }
    }

    public void redo() {
        if (!redoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = redoStack.pop();
            command.execute();
            commandHistory.push(command);
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class TextEditorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor editor = new TextEditor();
        CommandManager commandManager = new CommandManager();

        Command addHello = new AddTextCommand(editor, "Hello");
        Command addWorld = new AddTextCommand(editor, " World");

        commandManager.executeCommand(addHello);
        commandManager.executeCommand(addWorld);

        System.out.println("Text after commands: " + editor.getText());

        commandManager.undo();
        System.out.println("Text after undo: " + editor.getText());

        commandManager.redo();
        System.out.println("Text after redo: " + editor.getText());
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Command Interface**: The `Command` interface declares methods for executing and undoing operations.
- **Concrete Command**: The `AddTextCommand` class implements the `Command` interface and provides the logic for adding and removing text.
- **Receiver**: The `TextEditor` class performs the actual operations of adding and removing text.
- **Invoker**: The `CommandManager` class manages the execution of commands and maintains the history for undo and redo operations.
- **Client**: The `TextEditorApp` class demonstrates the use of the Command Pattern to perform and undo text operations.

### Managing State Restoration

When implementing undo and redo functionality, it's crucial to manage state restoration carefully. Each command should encapsulate enough information to reverse its effects. This often involves storing the state before the command execution and restoring it during the undo operation.

#### Considerations for Commands that Modify State

1. **State Preservation**: Ensure that each command can restore the system to its previous state. This may involve storing additional state information within the command.
2. **Complex Commands**: For complex commands that affect multiple objects or have side effects, consider using a Memento pattern to capture and restore state.
3. **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of maintaining a command history, especially in applications with frequent state changes.

### Visualizing the Command Pattern with Undo/Redo

To better understand the flow of the Command Pattern with undo and redo functionality, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    participant Command
    participant Receiver

    Client->>Invoker: executeCommand(Command)
    Invoker->>Command: execute()
    Command->>Receiver: performAction()
    Command-->>Invoker: push to history

    Client->>Invoker: undo()
    Invoker->>Command: undo()
    Command->>Receiver: undoAction()
    Command-->>Invoker: push to redo stack

    Client->>Invoker: redo()
    Invoker->>Command: execute()
    Command->>Receiver: performAction()
    Command-->>Invoker: push to history
```

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code example to add new features:

- **Implement a `RemoveTextCommand`**: Create a new command class that removes a specified number of characters from the text and supports undo and redo.
- **Add a `ClearTextCommand`**: Implement a command that clears all text in the editor and can be undone and redone.
- **Enhance the `TextEditor`**: Add functionality to support more complex text operations, such as replacing text or changing text case.

### Knowledge Check

Before we conclude, let's reinforce our understanding with a few questions:

- How does the Command Pattern facilitate undo and redo functionality?
- What is the role of the Invoker in the Command Pattern?
- Why is it important to clear the redo stack when executing a new command?

### Conclusion

Implementing undo and redo functionality using the Command Pattern in Java provides a robust and flexible solution for managing reversible operations. By encapsulating requests as objects, we can easily maintain a history of commands and support complex state restoration. As you continue to explore design patterns, remember that the Command Pattern is just one tool in your toolkit for building maintainable and scalable software systems.
