## 5.12.4 Visitor vs. Iterator Pattern

Design patterns are essential tools in a software engineer's toolkit, providing reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Among these, the Visitor and Iterator patterns are two behavioral patterns that, while distinct in their purposes and applications, can sometimes be confused due to their involvement with collections and object structures. In this section, we will delve into the nuances of these patterns, compare their intents, and explore scenarios where each is more appropriate. Additionally, we will discuss how these patterns can be used together in complex structures.

### Understanding the Visitor Pattern

The Visitor pattern is a design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It involves creating a visitor class that implements a specific operation on elements of an object structure. The Visitor pattern is particularly useful when you want to perform operations across a set of objects with different interfaces or classes without modifying their code.

#### Key Components of the Visitor Pattern

- **Visitor Interface**: Declares a visit operation for each type of element in the object structure.
- **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the operations defined in the Visitor interface.
- **Element Interface**: Declares an accept method that takes a visitor as an argument.
- **Concrete Element**: Implements the accept method, which calls the appropriate visit method on the visitor.
- **Object Structure**: A collection of elements that can be iterated over and visited by the visitor.

#### Example of the Visitor Pattern

Consider a scenario where we have a collection of different types of shapes, and we want to perform operations like drawing and calculating the area without modifying the shape classes.

```java
// Visitor Interface
interface ShapeVisitor {
    void visit(Circle circle);
    void visit(Rectangle rectangle);
}

// Concrete Visitor
class ShapeDrawer implements ShapeVisitor {
    public void visit(Circle circle) {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

// Element Interface
interface Shape {
    void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor);
}

// Concrete Elements
class Circle implements Shape {
    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// Object Structure
class ShapeCollection {
    private List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addShape(Shape shape) {
        shapes.add(shape);
    }

    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {
        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            shape.accept(visitor);
        }
    }
}

// Client Code
public class VisitorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeCollection collection = new ShapeCollection();
        collection.addShape(new Circle());
        collection.addShape(new Rectangle());

        ShapeDrawer drawer = new ShapeDrawer();
        collection.accept(drawer);
    }
}
```

### Understanding the Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It is particularly useful for traversing collections like lists, stacks, or trees.

#### Key Components of the Iterator Pattern

- **Iterator Interface**: Defines methods for accessing and traversing elements.
- **Concrete Iterator**: Implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal.
- **Aggregate Interface**: Defines a method to create an iterator.
- **Concrete Aggregate**: Implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the Concrete Iterator.

#### Example of the Iterator Pattern

Let's consider a simple example of an iterator for a collection of integers.

```java
// Iterator Interface
interface Iterator {
    boolean hasNext();
    int next();
}

// Concrete Iterator
class IntegerIterator implements Iterator {
    private int[] numbers;
    private int position = 0;

    public IntegerIterator(int[] numbers) {
        this.numbers = numbers;
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return position < numbers.length;
    }

    public int next() {
        return numbers[position++];
    }
}

// Aggregate Interface
interface IterableCollection {
    Iterator createIterator();
}

// Concrete Aggregate
class NumberCollection implements IterableCollection {
    private int[] numbers;

    public NumberCollection(int[] numbers) {
        this.numbers = numbers;
    }

    public Iterator createIterator() {
        return new IntegerIterator(numbers);
    }
}

// Client Code
public class IteratorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberCollection collection = new NumberCollection(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
        Iterator iterator = collection.createIterator();

        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}
```

### Comparing Visitor and Iterator Patterns

#### Intent and Purpose

- **Visitor Pattern**: The primary intent is to define new operations on an object structure without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. It is particularly useful when the object structure is stable, but new operations are frequently added.
  
- **Iterator Pattern**: The main purpose is to provide a standard way to traverse a collection of elements without exposing its internal structure. It focuses on traversal rather than operations on elements.

#### Use Cases

- **Visitor Pattern**: Use when you need to perform multiple distinct operations across a set of objects with different interfaces. It is ideal for scenarios where operations need to be added or modified frequently.

- **Iterator Pattern**: Use when you need to traverse a collection of elements in a uniform manner. It is suitable for scenarios where the focus is on accessing elements sequentially.

#### Code Structure

- **Visitor Pattern**: Involves multiple classes for visitors and elements, with each element class implementing an accept method.

- **Iterator Pattern**: Involves a single iterator class that implements methods for traversal, such as `hasNext()` and `next()`.

#### Flexibility

- **Visitor Pattern**: Offers flexibility in adding new operations without modifying existing element classes, but adding new element classes requires changes to the visitor interface.

- **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a flexible way to traverse collections, but adding new traversal methods requires changes to the iterator interface.

### Scenarios for Using Visitor and Iterator Patterns

#### When to Use the Visitor Pattern

- When you have a complex object structure and need to perform multiple operations on it.
- When the operations on the object structure are likely to change frequently.
- When you want to separate the algorithm from the object structure to enhance maintainability.

#### When to Use the Iterator Pattern

- When you need to traverse a collection of elements without exposing its internal structure.
- When you want to provide a uniform interface for accessing elements of different collections.
- When you need to support multiple traversal methods for a collection.

### Combining Visitor and Iterator Patterns

In complex systems, there are scenarios where both the Visitor and Iterator patterns can be used together to leverage their strengths. For instance, you might use an iterator to traverse a collection and a visitor to perform operations on each element.

#### Example: Combining Visitor and Iterator

Consider a scenario where we have a collection of shapes, and we want to calculate the total area of all shapes using both patterns.

```java
// Visitor Interface
interface AreaVisitor {
    double visit(Circle circle);
    double visit(Rectangle rectangle);
}

// Concrete Visitor
class AreaCalculator implements AreaVisitor {
    public double visit(Circle circle) {
        return Math.PI * circle.getRadius() * circle.getRadius();
    }
    public double visit(Rectangle rectangle) {
        return rectangle.getWidth() * rectangle.getHeight();
    }
}

// Shape Interface
interface Shape {
    void accept(AreaVisitor visitor);
}

// Concrete Elements
class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    public void accept(AreaVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    public double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    public void accept(AreaVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// Iterator Interface
interface ShapeIterator {
    boolean hasNext();
    Shape next();
}

// Concrete Iterator
class ShapeCollectionIterator implements ShapeIterator {
    private List<Shape> shapes;
    private int position = 0;

    public ShapeCollectionIterator(List<Shape> shapes) {
        this.shapes = shapes;
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return position < shapes.size();
    }

    public Shape next() {
        return shapes.get(position++);
    }
}

// Shape Collection
class ShapeCollection {
    private List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addShape(Shape shape) {
        shapes.add(shape);
    }

    public ShapeIterator createIterator() {
        return new ShapeCollectionIterator(shapes);
    }
}

// Client Code
public class VisitorIteratorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeCollection collection = new ShapeCollection();
        collection.addShape(new Circle(5));
        collection.addShape(new Rectangle(4, 6));

        ShapeIterator iterator = collection.createIterator();
        AreaCalculator calculator = new AreaCalculator();
        double totalArea = 0;

        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            Shape shape = iterator.next();
            totalArea += shape.accept(calculator);
        }

        System.out.println("Total Area: " + totalArea);
    }
}
```

### Visualizing the Interaction

To better understand how the Visitor and Iterator patterns can work together, let's visualize the interaction using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        +accept(AreaVisitor visitor)
    }
    class Circle {
        +accept(AreaVisitor visitor)
        +getRadius() double
    }
    class Rectangle {
        +accept(AreaVisitor visitor)
        +getWidth() double
        +getHeight() double
    }
    class AreaVisitor {
        <<interface>>
        +visit(Circle circle) double
        +visit(Rectangle rectangle) double
    }
    class AreaCalculator {
        +visit(Circle circle) double
        +visit(Rectangle rectangle) double
    }
    class ShapeIterator {
        <<interface>>
        +hasNext() boolean
        +next() Shape
    }
    class ShapeCollectionIterator {
        +hasNext() boolean
        +next() Shape
    }
    class ShapeCollection {
        +addShape(Shape shape)
        +createIterator() ShapeIterator
    }

    Shape <|-- Circle
    Shape <|-- Rectangle
    AreaVisitor <|-- AreaCalculator
    ShapeIterator <|-- ShapeCollectionIterator
    ShapeCollection --> Shape
    ShapeCollection --> ShapeIterator
    Shape --> AreaVisitor
```
