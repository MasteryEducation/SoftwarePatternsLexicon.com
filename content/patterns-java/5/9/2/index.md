## 5.9.2 Context and State Classes

In the realm of software design, the State Pattern is a powerful tool that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object must exhibit different behaviors in different states, such as a vending machine, a traffic light system, or a media player. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of the Context and State classes, which are the core components of the State Pattern.

### Understanding the Context Class

The Context class is a central component in the State Pattern. It maintains a reference to an instance of a State subclass that defines the current state of the Context. The primary responsibility of the Context class is to delegate state-specific behavior to the current State object. This delegation allows the Context to change its behavior dynamically as its state changes.

#### Responsibilities of the Context Class

1. **State Management**: The Context class is responsible for maintaining the current state of the object. It holds a reference to a State object that represents the current state.

2. **State Transition**: The Context class is responsible for managing state transitions. It decides when to transition from one state to another based on certain conditions or events.

3. **Delegation of Behavior**: The Context class delegates state-specific behavior to the current State object. This delegation allows the Context to change its behavior dynamically without modifying its code.

4. **Interaction with Clients**: The Context class provides an interface for clients to interact with. Clients interact with the Context without needing to know about the underlying states.

#### Code Example: Context Class

```java
public class Context {
    private State currentState;

    public Context(State initialState) {
        this.currentState = initialState;
    }

    public void setState(State state) {
        this.currentState = state;
    }

    public void request() {
        currentState.handle(this);
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `Context` class maintains a reference to a `State` object and delegates the `handle` method to the current state. The `setState` method allows the state to be changed dynamically.

### Exploring State Classes

State classes encapsulate the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context. Each State class implements a common interface that defines the behavior that can be performed in that state. This encapsulation allows each state to have its own implementation of the behavior, making it easy to add new states or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the system.

#### Responsibilities of State Classes

1. **Encapsulation of Behavior**: Each State class encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state. This encapsulation allows each state to have its own implementation of the behavior.

2. **State Transition Logic**: State classes can contain logic to determine when a transition to another state should occur. This logic can be based on conditions or events.

3. **Interaction with Context**: State classes interact with the Context to perform state-specific behavior. They can also request the Context to change its state.

#### Code Example: State Interface and Concrete States

```java
public interface State {
    void handle(Context context);
}

public class ConcreteStateA implements State {
    @Override
    public void handle(Context context) {
        System.out.println("State A handling request.");
        context.setState(new ConcreteStateB());
    }
}

public class ConcreteStateB implements State {
    @Override
    public void handle(Context context) {
        System.out.println("State B handling request.");
        context.setState(new ConcreteStateA());
    }
}
```

In this example, `ConcreteStateA` and `ConcreteStateB` are implementations of the `State` interface. Each state handles the request differently and transitions to the other state after handling the request.

### Interaction Between Context and State Classes

The interaction between the Context and State classes is crucial for the State Pattern to work effectively. The Context class delegates the behavior to the current State object, and the State object can request the Context to change its state. This interaction allows the system to change its behavior dynamically based on the current state.

#### Diagram: Context and State Interaction

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        - State currentState
        + setState(State state)
        + request()
    }

    class State {
        <<interface>>
        + handle(Context context)
    }

    class ConcreteStateA {
        + handle(Context context)
    }

    class ConcreteStateB {
        + handle(Context context)
    }

    Context --> State
    State <|-- ConcreteStateA
    State <|-- ConcreteStateB
```

In the diagram above, the `Context` class maintains a reference to a `State` object. The `ConcreteStateA` and `ConcreteStateB` classes implement the `State` interface and define the behavior for each state.

### Handling State Transitions

State transitions are a critical aspect of the State Pattern. They allow the system to change its behavior dynamically based on the current state. State transitions can be triggered by events, conditions, or actions performed by the Context or State classes.

#### Code Example: State Transition

In the previous code example, each state transitions to the other state after handling the request. This transition is achieved by calling the `setState` method on the Context.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Context context = new Context(new ConcreteStateA());
        context.request(); // State A handling request.
        context.request(); // State B handling request.
        context.request(); // State A handling request.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Main` class creates a `Context` with an initial state of `ConcreteStateA`. Each call to `request` results in a state transition, demonstrating the dynamic behavior of the State Pattern.

### Try It Yourself

To better understand the State Pattern, try modifying the code examples to add a new state or change the transition logic. For example, you could add a `ConcreteStateC` that transitions to `ConcreteStateA` after handling a request.

### Visualizing State Transitions

Let's visualize the state transitions using a state diagram. This diagram will help you understand how the system transitions between different states.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ConcreteStateA
    ConcreteStateA --> ConcreteStateB : handle()
    ConcreteStateB --> ConcreteStateA : handle()
```

In this state diagram, the system starts in `ConcreteStateA` and transitions to `ConcreteStateB` after handling a request. It then transitions back to `ConcreteStateA` after handling another request.

### Knowledge Check

Before we move on, let's reinforce what we've learned with a few questions:

- What is the primary responsibility of the Context class in the State Pattern?
- How do State classes encapsulate behavior for each state?
