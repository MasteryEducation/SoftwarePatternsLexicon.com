## 5.14.2 Composing Specifications

In the realm of software design, the Specification Pattern stands out as a powerful tool for defining business rules and logic in a clean, reusable manner. By composing specifications, we can build complex rules from simple, reusable components using logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT. This approach not only enhances code readability and maintainability but also promotes flexibility and reusability.

### Understanding the Specification Pattern

The Specification Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to encapsulate business logic into reusable components called specifications. Each specification represents a single rule or condition. By combining these specifications, we can create complex logic without resorting to hard-coded conditions scattered throughout the codebase.

### Why Compose Specifications?

Composing specifications offers several advantages over traditional hard-coded logic:

1. **Reusability**: Specifications can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing duplication.
2. **Flexibility**: New rules can be added or existing ones modified without altering the core logic.
3. **Readability**: The code becomes more readable as specifications are self-descriptive and encapsulate specific logic.
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to business rules are localized, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.

### Key Concepts in Composing Specifications

Before diving into code examples, let's explore the key concepts involved in composing specifications:

- **Specification Interface**: Defines the contract for evaluating conditions.
- **Concrete Specifications**: Implementations of the specification interface representing specific rules.
- **Composite Specifications**: Combine multiple specifications using logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).

### Implementing the Specification Pattern in Java

Let's start by defining a simple specification interface in Java:

```java
public interface Specification<T> {
    boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate);
    
    Specification<T> and(Specification<T> other);
    Specification<T> or(Specification<T> other);
    Specification<T> not();
}
```

This interface provides a method `isSatisfiedBy` to evaluate a condition and methods for combining specifications using logical operations.

#### Concrete Specifications

Now, let's implement some concrete specifications. Consider a scenario where we have a `Product` class, and we want to filter products based on certain criteria such as price and category.

```java
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private String category;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}

public class PriceSpecification implements Specification<Product> {
    private double maxPrice;

    public PriceSpecification(double maxPrice) {
        this.maxPrice = maxPrice;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product) {
        return product.getPrice() <= maxPrice;
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> and(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> or(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}

public class CategorySpecification implements Specification<Product> {
    private String category;

    public CategorySpecification(String category) {
        this.category = category;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product) {
        return product.getCategory().equalsIgnoreCase(category);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> and(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> or(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}
```

#### Composite Specifications

Next, let's implement the composite specifications for AND, OR, and NOT operations:

```java
public class AndSpecification<T> implements Specification<T> {
    private Specification<T> first;
    private Specification<T> second;

    public AndSpecification(Specification<T> first, Specification<T> second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate) {
        return first.isSatisfiedBy(candidate) && second.isSatisfiedBy(candidate);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> and(Specification<T> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> or(Specification<T> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}

public class OrSpecification<T> implements Specification<T> {
    private Specification<T> first;
    private Specification<T> second;

    public OrSpecification(Specification<T> first, Specification<T> second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate) {
        return first.isSatisfiedBy(candidate) || second.isSatisfiedBy(candidate);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> and(Specification<T> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> or(Specification<T> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}

public class NotSpecification<T> implements Specification<T> {
    private Specification<T> wrapped;

    public NotSpecification(Specification<T> wrapped) {
        this.wrapped = wrapped;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate) {
        return !wrapped.isSatisfiedBy(candidate);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> and(Specification<T> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> or(Specification<T> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<T> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}
```

### Using Composed Specifications

With the specifications and combinators in place, we can now compose complex rules. Let's see how we can use these specifications to filter products:

```java
public class ProductFilter {
    public List<Product> filter(List<Product> products, Specification<Product> specification) {
        return products.stream()
                .filter(specification::isSatisfiedBy)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Product> products = Arrays.asList(
            new Product("Laptop", 1500, "Electronics"),
            new Product("Coffee Maker", 80, "Home Appliances"),
            new Product("Smartphone", 700, "Electronics"),
            new Product("Blender", 50, "Home Appliances")
        );

        Specification<Product> electronicsSpec = new CategorySpecification("Electronics");
        Specification<Product> priceSpec = new PriceSpecification(1000);

        Specification<Product> complexSpec = electronicsSpec.and(priceSpec);

        ProductFilter filter = new ProductFilter();
        List<Product> filteredProducts = filter.filter(products, complexSpec);

        filteredProducts.forEach(product -> System.out.println(product.getName()));
    }
}
```

In this example, we compose a complex specification that filters products that are in the "Electronics" category and have a price less than or equal to 1000. The `ProductFilter` class uses the composed specification to filter the list of products.

### Advantages of Composing Specifications

1. **Modularity**: Each specification encapsulates a single rule, making it easy to understand and modify.
2. **Testability**: Specifications can be tested independently, ensuring that each rule behaves as expected.
3. **Extensibility**: New specifications can be added without altering existing ones, allowing the system to evolve with changing requirements.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from the core application logic, promoting cleaner code architecture.

### Visualizing Specification Composition

To better understand how specifications are composed, let's visualize the process using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Specification~T~ {
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate)
        +Specification~T~ and(Specification~T~ other)
        +Specification~T~ or(Specification~T~ other)
        +Specification~T~ not()
    }

    class PriceSpecification {
        -double maxPrice
        +PriceSpecification(double maxPrice)
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product)
    }

    class CategorySpecification {
        -String category
        +CategorySpecification(String category)
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product)
    }

    class AndSpecification~T~ {
        -Specification~T~ first
        -Specification~T~ second
        +AndSpecification(Specification~T~ first, Specification~T~ second)
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate)
    }

    class OrSpecification~T~ {
        -Specification~T~ first
        -Specification~T~ second
        +OrSpecification(Specification~T~ first, Specification~T~ second)
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate)
    }

    class NotSpecification~T~ {
        -Specification~T~ wrapped
        +NotSpecification(Specification~T~ wrapped)
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(T candidate)
    }

    Specification~T~ <|-- PriceSpecification
    Specification~T~ <|-- CategorySpecification
    Specification~T~ <|-- AndSpecification~T~
    Specification~T~ <|-- OrSpecification~T~
    Specification~T~ <|-- NotSpecification~T~
```

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples:

- **Add a new specification**: Implement a `NameSpecification` that filters products by name.
- **Combine more specifications**: Create a specification that checks if a product is either in the "Electronics" category or costs less than 100.
- **Test different combinations**: Experiment with different logical combinations to see how they affect the filtering results.
