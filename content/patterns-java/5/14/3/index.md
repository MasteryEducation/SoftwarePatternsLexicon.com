## 5.14.3 Use Cases and Examples

The Specification Pattern is a powerful tool in the software engineer's toolkit, particularly when dealing with complex business rules and dynamic filtering criteria. This pattern allows us to encapsulate business logic into reusable, combinable components, making our code more flexible and maintainable. In this section, we'll explore real-world applications of the Specification Pattern, focusing on scenarios like user authorization and product selection filters. We'll provide detailed explanations and code examples to illustrate how this pattern can be effectively implemented in Java.

### Understanding the Specification Pattern

Before diving into use cases, let's briefly revisit the Specification Pattern. This pattern is used to encapsulate business rules and logic into a single unit, known as a specification. A specification can be combined with other specifications to form complex logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT. This makes it ideal for scenarios where business rules are subject to frequent changes or need to be applied dynamically.

### Real-World Use Cases

#### 1. User Authorization Rules

In many applications, user authorization is a critical component. The Specification Pattern can be used to define complex authorization rules that determine whether a user has access to certain resources or actions. By encapsulating these rules into specifications, we can easily modify them without affecting other parts of the system.

##### Code Example: User Authorization

Let's consider a scenario where we have a system with different user roles, and we need to determine if a user has access to perform certain actions based on their role and permissions.

```java
// Specification interface
public interface Specification<T> {
    boolean isSatisfiedBy(T t);
    Specification<T> and(Specification<T> other);
    Specification<T> or(Specification<T> other);
    Specification<T> not();
}

// Concrete specification for checking user roles
public class RoleSpecification implements Specification<User> {
    private final String requiredRole;

    public RoleSpecification(String requiredRole) {
        this.requiredRole = requiredRole;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(User user) {
        return user.getRoles().contains(requiredRole);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<User> and(Specification<User> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<User> or(Specification<User> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<User> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}

// Example usage
public class AuthorizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        User user = new User("John Doe", List.of("ADMIN", "USER"));

        Specification<User> isAdmin = new RoleSpecification("ADMIN");
        Specification<User> isUser = new RoleSpecification("USER");

        boolean canAccessAdminPanel = isAdmin.isSatisfiedBy(user);
        boolean canAccessUserPanel = isUser.isSatisfiedBy(user);

        System.out.println("Can access admin panel: " + canAccessAdminPanel);
        System.out.println("Can access user panel: " + canAccessUserPanel);
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `RoleSpecification` that checks if a user has a specific role. We can easily combine this with other specifications to create more complex authorization rules.

#### 2. Product Selection Filters

Another common use case for the Specification Pattern is in e-commerce applications, where users need to filter products based on various criteria such as price, category, and availability. By using specifications, we can create flexible and dynamic filters that can be easily adjusted as business requirements change.

##### Code Example: Product Filtering

Consider an e-commerce application where we need to filter products based on price range and category.

```java
// Concrete specification for checking product price range
public class PriceSpecification implements Specification<Product> {
    private final double minPrice;
    private final double maxPrice;

    public PriceSpecification(double minPrice, double maxPrice) {
        this.minPrice = minPrice;
        this.maxPrice = maxPrice;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product) {
        return product.getPrice() >= minPrice && product.getPrice() <= maxPrice;
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> and(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> or(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}

// Concrete specification for checking product category
public class CategorySpecification implements Specification<Product> {
    private final String category;

    public CategorySpecification(String category) {
        this.category = category;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product) {
        return product.getCategory().equalsIgnoreCase(category);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> and(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new AndSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> or(Specification<Product> other) {
        return new OrSpecification<>(this, other);
    }

    @Override
    public Specification<Product> not() {
        return new NotSpecification<>(this);
    }
}

// Example usage
public class ProductFilterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Product> products = List.of(
            new Product("Laptop", 999.99, "Electronics"),
            new Product("Coffee Maker", 49.99, "Home Appliances"),
            new Product("Smartphone", 699.99, "Electronics")
        );

        Specification<Product> electronicsCategory = new CategorySpecification("Electronics");
        Specification<Product> priceRange = new PriceSpecification(100, 1000);

        List<Product> filteredProducts = products.stream()
            .filter(electronicsCategory.and(priceRange)::isSatisfiedBy)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

        filteredProducts.forEach(product -> System.out.println(product.getName()));
    }
}
```

In this example, we define `PriceSpecification` and `CategorySpecification` to filter products based on price and category. We then use these specifications to filter a list of products, demonstrating the flexibility and reusability of the Specification Pattern.

### Benefits of Using the Specification Pattern

The Specification Pattern offers several benefits, particularly in scenarios where business rules are complex and subject to change:

- **Reusability**: Specifications can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication.
- **Flexibility**: By combining specifications, we can easily create complex business rules without modifying existing code.
- **Maintainability**: Encapsulating business logic into specifications makes it easier to manage and update as requirements change.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Specification Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided:

1. **Extend the User Authorization Example**: Add a new specification to check if a user has a specific permission, and combine it with role specifications to create more complex authorization rules.

2. **Enhance the Product Filtering Example**: Introduce a new specification for filtering products based on availability or rating, and combine it with existing specifications to create a more comprehensive filter.

### Visualizing the Specification Pattern

To better understand how the Specification Pattern works, let's visualize the process of combining specifications using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Specification~T~ {
        <<interface>>
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(T t)
        +Specification~T~ and(Specification~T~ other)
        +Specification~T~ or(Specification~T~ other)
        +Specification~T~ not()
    }

    class RoleSpecification {
        -String requiredRole
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(User user)
        +Specification~User~ and(Specification~User~ other)
        +Specification~User~ or(Specification~User~ other)
        +Specification~User~ not()
    }

    class PriceSpecification {
        -double minPrice
        -double maxPrice
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product)
        +Specification~Product~ and(Specification~Product~ other)
        +Specification~Product~ or(Specification~Product~ other)
        +Specification~Product~ not()
    }

    class CategorySpecification {
        -String category
        +boolean isSatisfiedBy(Product product)
        +Specification~Product~ and(Specification~Product~ other)
        +Specification~Product~ or(Specification~Product~ other)
        +Specification~Product~ not()
    }

    Specification <|.. RoleSpecification
    Specification <|.. PriceSpecification
    Specification <|.. CategorySpecification
```

This diagram illustrates how different specifications implement the `Specification` interface, allowing them to be combined using logical operations.
