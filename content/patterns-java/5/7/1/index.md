## 5.7.1 Implementing Memento in Java

In this section, we will delve into the Memento design pattern, a behavioral pattern that allows us to capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo mechanisms or maintain historical states of an object. Let's explore how to implement the Memento pattern in Java, complete with detailed explanations and code examples.

### Understanding the Memento Pattern

The Memento pattern is designed to capture an object's internal state so that it can be restored later. It involves three primary components:

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. **Memento**: A representation of the Originator's state at a particular point in time.
3. **Caretaker**: Manages the mementos and is responsible for storing and retrieving them.

Let's visualize the interaction between these components using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Originator {
        -state: String
        +createMemento(): Memento
        +restore(memento: Memento)
    }
    
    class Memento {
        -state: String
        +getState(): String
    }
    
    class Caretaker {
        -mementos: List~Memento~
        +addMemento(memento: Memento)
        +getMemento(index: int): Memento
    }
    
    Originator --> Memento
    Caretaker --> Memento
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Define the Memento Class

The Memento class is a simple data holder that stores the state of the Originator. It should not expose any methods that allow modification of its state, ensuring encapsulation.

```java
public class Memento {
    private final String state;

    public Memento(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }
}
```

In this example, the Memento class holds a single state, represented as a `String`. The state is immutable, as indicated by the `final` keyword, ensuring that once a Memento is created, its state cannot be changed.

#### Step 2: Implement the Originator Class

The Originator is responsible for creating and restoring its state using Mementos. It provides methods to create a Memento and restore its state from a Memento.

```java
public class Originator {
    private String state;

    public void setState(String state) {
        System.out.println("Setting state to " + state);
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public Memento createMemento() {
        System.out.println("Creating Memento with state: " + state);
        return new Memento(state);
    }

    public void restore(Memento memento) {
        state = memento.getState();
        System.out.println("State restored to " + state);
    }
}
```

The `Originator` class has methods to set its state, create a Memento, and restore its state from a Memento. The `createMemento` method captures the current state, while the `restore` method updates the state based on a given Memento.

#### Step 3: Create the Caretaker Class

The Caretaker is responsible for managing Mementos. It stores Mementos and provides methods to retrieve them.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Caretaker {
    private final List<Memento> mementos = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addMemento(Memento memento) {
        mementos.add(memento);
        System.out.println("Memento added. Total mementos: " + mementos.size());
    }

    public Memento getMemento(int index) {
        return mementos.get(index);
    }
}
```

The `Caretaker` class uses a `List` to store Memento objects. It provides methods to add a Memento to the list and retrieve a Memento by its index.

### Putting It All Together

Now that we have defined the Memento, Originator, and Caretaker classes, let's see how they work together in a simple example.

```java
public class MementoPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Originator originator = new Originator();
        Caretaker caretaker = new Caretaker();

        originator.setState("State1");
        caretaker.addMemento(originator.createMemento());

        originator.setState("State2");
        caretaker.addMemento(originator.createMemento());

        originator.setState("State3");
        System.out.println("Current State: " + originator.getState());

        originator.restore(caretaker.getMemento(1));
        System.out.println("Restored to State: " + originator.getState());

        originator.restore(caretaker.getMemento(0));
        System.out.println("Restored to State: " + originator.getState());
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an `Originator` and a `Caretaker`. We change the state of the Originator and save its state using the Caretaker. Later, we restore the Originator's state to previous states using the saved Mementos.

### Try It Yourself

To better understand the Memento pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- **Experiment with Different Data Types**: Change the state in the Memento to other data types, such as `int` or custom objects.
- **Implement Undo and Redo**: Extend the Caretaker to support undo and redo operations by maintaining a pointer to the current state.
- **Add Timestamps**: Modify the Memento to include timestamps and print them when restoring states.

### Visualizing the Memento Pattern in Action

To further illustrate the Memento pattern, let's visualize the process of saving and restoring states using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Originator
    participant Caretaker
    participant Memento

    Originator->>Memento: createMemento()
    Memento-->>Originator: Memento(state)
    Originator->>Caretaker: addMemento(memento)
    Caretaker-->>Originator: memento added

    Originator->>Memento: createMemento()
    Memento-->>Originator: Memento(state)
    Originator->>Caretaker: addMemento(memento)
    Caretaker-->>Originator: memento added

    Originator->>Caretaker: getMemento(index)
    Caretaker-->>Originator: return memento
    Originator->>Memento: restore(memento)
    Memento-->>Originator: state restored
```

### Best Practices and Considerations

When implementing the Memento pattern, consider the following best practices:

- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that the Memento class does not expose methods that allow its state to be modified. This maintains the integrity of the saved state.
- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of memory usage, especially if the Originator's state is large or if many Mementos are created. Consider strategies to limit the number of stored Mementos.
- **Serialization**: For complex states, consider using serialization to store Mementos, especially if you need to persist them beyond the application's lifecycle.

### Knowledge Check

Before we wrap up, let's pose a few questions to reinforce your understanding:

- What is the primary purpose of the Memento pattern?
- How does the Caretaker manage Mementos?
- Why is encapsulation important in the Memento pattern?
