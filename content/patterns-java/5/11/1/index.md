## 5.11.1 Implementing Template Method in Java

The Template Method Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an abstract class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple classes that follow the same algorithm but implement some steps differently.

### Understanding the Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is all about defining a method in a base class that outlines the steps of an algorithm. Some of these steps are implemented in the base class, while others are left abstract, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementations. This approach promotes code reuse and ensures consistency across different implementations.

#### Key Concepts

- **Template Method**: A method in the base class that defines the algorithm's structure. It calls other methods, some of which may be abstract.
- **Abstract Methods**: Methods declared in the base class but implemented in subclasses. These represent the variable parts of the algorithm.
- **Concrete Methods**: Methods that have a fixed implementation in the base class and are called by the template method.

### Implementing the Template Method Pattern

Let's walk through the implementation of the Template Method Pattern in Java with a step-by-step guide.

#### Step 1: Define the Abstract Class

The abstract class will contain the template method and any concrete methods. It will also declare abstract methods that subclasses must implement.

```java
abstract class DataProcessor {
    
    // Template method
    public final void process() {
        readData();
        processData();
        writeData();
    }

    // Concrete method
    void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data from source...");
    }

    // Abstract methods
    abstract void processData();

    void writeData() {
        System.out.println("Writing data to destination...");
    }
}
```

In this example, `DataProcessor` is an abstract class with a template method `process()`. The `process()` method outlines the steps of the algorithm: reading data, processing data, and writing data. The `readData()` and `writeData()` methods are concrete, while `processData()` is abstract, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations.

#### Step 2: Create Subclasses

Subclasses will extend the abstract class and provide implementations for the abstract methods.

```java
class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {

    @Override
    void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing CSV data...");
    }
}

class XMLDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {

    @Override
    void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing XML data...");
    }
}
```

Here, `CSVDataProcessor` and `XMLDataProcessor` are subclasses of `DataProcessor`. They provide specific implementations for the `processData()` method.

#### Step 3: Use the Template Method

To use the template method, create instances of the subclasses and call the template method.

```java
public class TemplateMethodDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataProcessor csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor();
        csvProcessor.process();

        DataProcessor xmlProcessor = new XMLDataProcessor();
        xmlProcessor.process();
    }
}
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Reading data from source...
Processing CSV data...
Writing data to destination...
Reading data from source...
Processing XML data...
Writing data to destination...
```

### Best Practices for Designing Template Methods

1. **Keep Template Methods Simple**: The template method should be as simple as possible, focusing on the algorithm's structure. Avoid adding complex logic within the template method itself.

2. **Use Final Modifier**: Declare the template method as `final` to prevent subclasses from overriding it. This ensures that the algorithm's structure remains unchanged.

3. **Minimize Concrete Methods**: While concrete methods can be part of the base class, aim to keep them minimal. The focus should be on defining abstract methods that subclasses can implement.

4. **Document the Algorithm**: Clearly document the purpose of each step in the template method. This helps maintainers understand the algorithm's flow and the role of each method.

5. **Consider Hook Methods**: Hook methods are optional methods in the base class that subclasses can override. They provide additional flexibility without altering the template method's structure.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

To better understand the Template Method Pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DataProcessor {
        +process()
        +readData()
        +processData()
        +writeData()
    }
    class CSVDataProcessor {
        +processData()
    }
    class XMLDataProcessor {
        +processData()
    }
    DataProcessor <|-- CSVDataProcessor
    DataProcessor <|-- XMLDataProcessor
```

In this diagram, `DataProcessor` is the abstract class with the template method `process()`. `CSVDataProcessor` and `XMLDataProcessor` are subclasses that implement the `processData()` method.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Template Method Pattern by modifying the code examples. Here are some suggestions:

- **Add a New Subclass**: Create a new subclass, such as `JSONDataProcessor`, and implement the `processData()` method to handle JSON data.
- **Modify Concrete Methods**: Change the implementation of `readData()` or `writeData()` to simulate reading from or writing to different sources.
- **Introduce Hook Methods**: Add a hook method in the `DataProcessor` class that subclasses can override to perform additional actions before or after processing data.

### Knowledge Check

Let's reinforce what we've learned with a few questions:

1. What is the purpose of the template method in the Template Method Pattern?
2. Why should the template method be declared as `final`?
3. How do hook methods enhance the Template Method Pattern?
