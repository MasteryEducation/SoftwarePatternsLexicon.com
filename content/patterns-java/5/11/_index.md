## 5.11 Template Method Pattern

In the realm of software design, achieving code reuse and consistency while maintaining flexibility is a common challenge. The Template Method Pattern offers a solution by defining the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without altering the algorithm's overall structure. This pattern is a cornerstone of behavioral design patterns, enabling developers to create robust and flexible codebases.

### Understanding the Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called the template method. This method defers some steps to subclasses, allowing them to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. The pattern promotes code reuse and consistency by encapsulating invariant parts of the algorithm in a base class, while allowing subclasses to customize specific behaviors.

#### Intent of the Template Method Pattern

The primary intent of the Template Method Pattern is to:

- Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- Allow subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
- Promote code reuse and consistency by encapsulating invariant parts of the algorithm in a base class.

### Problem Addressed by the Template Method Pattern

In software development, it's common to encounter scenarios where multiple classes share a similar algorithmic structure but differ in specific steps. Without a structured approach, this can lead to code duplication, inconsistency, and maintenance challenges. The Template Method Pattern addresses these issues by:

- **Code Reuse**: By defining the common structure in a base class, the pattern promotes code reuse, reducing duplication across subclasses.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the algorithm's structure remains consistent across different implementations, enhancing maintainability.
- **Flexibility**: Allows subclasses to customize specific steps of the algorithm, providing flexibility without altering the overall structure.

### Key Components of the Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern involves the following key components:

1. **Abstract Class**: Defines the template method and declares abstract methods for steps that need customization.
2. **Concrete Subclasses**: Implement the abstract methods, providing specific behaviors for the customized steps.
3. **Template Method**: The method in the abstract class that defines the algorithm's skeleton, calling the abstract methods at appropriate points.

### Implementing the Template Method Pattern in Java

Let's explore how to implement the Template Method Pattern in Java through a practical example. Consider a scenario where we have a `Game` class that defines the structure of a game, but different games have unique implementations for starting, playing, and ending the game.

```java
// Abstract class defining the template method
abstract class Game {
    // Template method defining the skeleton of the algorithm
    public final void play() {
        initialize();
        startPlay();
        endPlay();
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    abstract void initialize();
    abstract void startPlay();
    abstract void endPlay();
}

// Concrete subclass implementing the abstract methods
class Chess extends Game {
    @Override
    void initialize() {
        System.out.println("Chess Game Initialized! Start playing.");
    }

    @Override
    void startPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Started. Welcome to Chess.");
    }

    @Override
    void endPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Finished!");
    }
}

// Another concrete subclass
class Football extends Game {
    @Override
    void initialize() {
        System.out.println("Football Game Initialized! Start playing.");
    }

    @Override
    void startPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Started. Welcome to Football.");
    }

    @Override
    void endPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Finished!");
    }
}

// Client code
public class TemplateMethodPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Chess();
        game.play();
        System.out.println();
        game = new Football();
        game.play();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Game` class defines the `play` method as the template method, which outlines the steps of the game. The `Chess` and `Football` classes are concrete subclasses that implement the abstract methods `initialize`, `startPlay`, and `endPlay`, providing specific behaviors for each game.

### UML Diagram of the Template Method Pattern

To better understand the structure of the Template Method Pattern, let's visualize it using a UML diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game {
        +play() void
        #initialize() void
        #startPlay() void
        #endPlay() void
    }
    class Chess {
        +initialize() void
        +startPlay() void
        +endPlay() void
    }
    class Football {
        +initialize() void
        +startPlay() void
        +endPlay() void
    }
    Game <|-- Chess
    Game <|-- Football
```

In the UML diagram, the `Game` class is the abstract class that defines the template method `play`. The `Chess` and `Football` classes are concrete subclasses that implement the abstract methods.

### Benefits of the Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern offers several benefits:

- **Code Reuse**: By defining the common algorithm structure in a base class, the pattern promotes code reuse, reducing duplication across subclasses.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the algorithm's structure remains consistent across different implementations, enhancing maintainability.
- **Flexibility**: Allows subclasses to customize specific steps of the algorithm, providing flexibility without altering the overall structure.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Changes to the algorithm's structure can be made in the base class, automatically propagating to all subclasses.

### When to Use the Template Method Pattern

Consider using the Template Method Pattern when:

- You have multiple classes that share a similar algorithmic structure but differ in specific steps.
- You want to promote code reuse and consistency across subclasses.
- You need to provide flexibility for subclasses to customize specific behaviors without altering the overall algorithm structure.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Template Method Pattern, try modifying the code example provided. Experiment with adding new games, such as `Basketball` or `Tennis`, and implement the abstract methods to customize their behaviors. Observe how the template method ensures consistency across different game implementations.
