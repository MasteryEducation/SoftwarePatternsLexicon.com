## 5.10.5 Use Cases and Examples

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple algorithms can be applied to a problem, and the choice of algorithm is determined by the context in which it is used.

### Real-World Scenarios Utilizing the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is widely used in software development to promote flexibility and reusability. Let's explore some real-world scenarios where this pattern shines:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Different sorting algorithms can be applied based on the data size and characteristics. For instance, quicksort is efficient for large datasets, while insertion sort might be more suitable for small or nearly sorted datasets.

2. **Validation Mechanisms**: Validation rules can vary based on the context, such as user input validation, data format validation, or business rule validation. The Strategy Pattern allows for dynamic selection of validation strategies.

3. **Payment Processing Systems**: In e-commerce applications, different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency) can be implemented as strategies, allowing the system to switch between them seamlessly.

4. **Compression Algorithms**: Applications that handle file compression can use different algorithms (e.g., ZIP, RAR, GZIP) as strategies, enabling users to choose the most suitable one for their needs.

5. **Game Development**: In games, different AI behaviors (aggressive, defensive, neutral) can be implemented as strategies, allowing for dynamic changes in gameplay.

### Implementing Sorting Strategies with the Strategy Pattern

Sorting algorithms are a classic example where the Strategy Pattern can be effectively applied. Let's consider a scenario where we need to sort a collection of integers using different algorithms based on the context.

#### Code Example: Sorting Strategies

```java
// Strategy interface
interface SortingStrategy {
    void sort(int[] numbers);
}

// Concrete strategy for Bubble Sort
class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        int n = numbers.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap numbers[j] and numbers[j+1]
                    int temp = numbers[j];
                    numbers[j] = numbers[j + 1];
                    numbers[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Concrete strategy for Quick Sort
class QuickSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        quickSort(numbers, 0, numbers.length - 1);
    }

    private void quickSort(int[] numbers, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(numbers, low, high);
            quickSort(numbers, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(numbers, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private int partition(int[] numbers, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = numbers[high];
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (numbers[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                int temp = numbers[i];
                numbers[i] = numbers[j];
                numbers[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        int temp = numbers[i + 1];
        numbers[i + 1] = numbers[high];
        numbers[high] = temp;
        return i + 1;
    }
}

// Context class
class SortContext {
    private SortingStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void executeStrategy(int[] numbers) {
        strategy.sort(numbers);
    }
}

// Client code
public class StrategyPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2};

        SortContext context = new SortContext();

        // Using Bubble Sort
        context.setStrategy(new BubbleSortStrategy());
        context.executeStrategy(numbers);
        System.out.println("Bubble Sorted: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));

        // Using Quick Sort
        context.setStrategy(new QuickSortStrategy());
        context.executeStrategy(numbers);
        System.out.println("Quick Sorted: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `SortingStrategy` interface with a `sort` method. Two concrete strategies, `BubbleSortStrategy` and `QuickSortStrategy`, implement this interface. The `SortContext` class maintains a reference to a `SortingStrategy` and delegates the sorting task to the current strategy. The client code demonstrates how to switch between different sorting strategies at runtime.

### Validation Mechanisms Using the Strategy Pattern

Validation is another area where the Strategy Pattern can be applied effectively. Consider a scenario where we need to validate user input based on different criteria.

#### Code Example: Validation Strategies

```java
// Strategy interface
interface ValidationStrategy {
    boolean validate(String data);
}

// Concrete strategy for email validation
class EmailValidationStrategy implements ValidationStrategy {
    @Override
    public boolean validate(String data) {
        return data.matches("^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$");
    }
}

// Concrete strategy for phone number validation
class PhoneNumberValidationStrategy implements ValidationStrategy {
    @Override
    public boolean validate(String data) {
        return data.matches("\\d{10}");
    }
}

// Context class
class ValidationContext {
    private ValidationStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(ValidationStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public boolean executeStrategy(String data) {
        return strategy.validate(data);
    }
}

// Client code
public class ValidationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ValidationContext context = new ValidationContext();

        // Validate email
        context.setStrategy(new EmailValidationStrategy());
        System.out.println("Email valid: " + context.executeStrategy("example@example.com"));

        // Validate phone number
        context.setStrategy(new PhoneNumberValidationStrategy());
        System.out.println("Phone number valid: " + context.executeStrategy("1234567890"));
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `ValidationStrategy` interface with a `validate` method. Two concrete strategies, `EmailValidationStrategy` and `PhoneNumberValidationStrategy`, implement this interface. The `ValidationContext` class maintains a reference to a `ValidationStrategy` and delegates the validation task to the current strategy. The client code demonstrates how to switch between different validation strategies at runtime.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying the strategies or adding new ones. For instance, try implementing a `MergeSortStrategy` or a `PostalCodeValidationStrategy`. Observe how easy it is to integrate new strategies without altering the existing codebase.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

To better understand the Strategy Pattern, let's visualize the relationships between the context, strategy interface, and concrete strategies.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SortingStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +sort(int[] numbers)
    }
    class BubbleSortStrategy {
        +sort(int[] numbers)
    }
    class QuickSortStrategy {
        +sort(int[] numbers)
    }
    class SortContext {
        -SortingStrategy strategy
        +setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy)
        +executeStrategy(int[] numbers)
    }
    SortingStrategy <|.. BubbleSortStrategy
    SortingStrategy <|.. QuickSortStrategy
    SortContext --> SortingStrategy
```

In this diagram, the `SortContext` class is associated with the `SortingStrategy` interface, and the concrete strategies (`BubbleSortStrategy` and `QuickSortStrategy`) implement the `SortingStrategy` interface. This structure allows the context to switch strategies dynamically.
