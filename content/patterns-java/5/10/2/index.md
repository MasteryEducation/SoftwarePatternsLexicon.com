## 5.10.2 Context and Strategy Interfaces

In the realm of software design patterns, the Strategy Pattern stands out for its ability to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to select an algorithm's behavior at runtime. Central to this pattern are the concepts of Context and Strategy interfaces, which ensure that strategies are interchangeable and adhere to the open/closed principle. In this section, we will delve into the importance of these interfaces, their roles, and how they interact to promote flexibility and maintainability in software design.

### Understanding the Strategy Pattern

Before we dive into the specifics of Context and Strategy interfaces, let's briefly revisit the Strategy Pattern itself. The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It achieves this by defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to switch between them seamlessly.

### The Importance of the Strategy Interface

The Strategy interface is the cornerstone of the Strategy Pattern. It defines a common interface for all the algorithms (or strategies) that can be used interchangeably. By adhering to this interface, each strategy ensures that it can be used in place of any other strategy, thus promoting flexibility and interchangeability.

#### Key Benefits of the Strategy Interface

1. **Interchangeability**: By defining a common interface, the Strategy Pattern allows different algorithms to be swapped in and out without altering the client code. This interchangeability is crucial for maintaining flexibility and adaptability in software design.

2. **Adherence to the Open/Closed Principle**: The open/closed principle, one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. By using a Strategy interface, new strategies can be added without modifying existing code, thus adhering to this principle.

3. **Encapsulation of Behavior**: Each strategy encapsulates a specific behavior or algorithm, allowing for clear separation of concerns. This encapsulation makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

### The Role of the Context Class

The Context class plays a pivotal role in the Strategy Pattern. It maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the task of executing the algorithm to the Strategy. The Context class is responsible for interacting with the client and selecting the appropriate strategy based on the client's needs.

#### How the Context Class Interacts with Strategies

1. **Strategy Selection**: The Context class is responsible for selecting the appropriate strategy based on the client's requirements. This selection can be made at runtime, allowing for dynamic behavior changes.

2. **Delegation of Behavior**: Once the strategy is selected, the Context class delegates the execution of the algorithm to the Strategy object. This delegation ensures that the Context class remains agnostic to the specific implementation details of the strategies.

3. **Maintaining a Reference to the Strategy**: The Context class maintains a reference to the current Strategy object. This reference allows the Context to switch strategies seamlessly, promoting flexibility and adaptability.

### Implementing the Strategy Pattern in Java

To illustrate the concepts discussed above, let's explore a practical example of implementing the Strategy Pattern in Java. We'll create a simple application that calculates the cost of a trip using different transportation strategies: car, bus, and bicycle.

#### Step 1: Define the Strategy Interface

The first step is to define the Strategy interface, which will be implemented by all the transportation strategies.

```java
// Strategy Interface
public interface TransportationStrategy {
    double calculateCost(double distance);
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Strategies

Next, we'll implement the concrete strategies for car, bus, and bicycle transportation.

```java
// Concrete Strategy for Car
public class CarStrategy implements TransportationStrategy {
    private static final double COST_PER_KM = 0.5;

    @Override
    public double calculateCost(double distance) {
        return distance * COST_PER_KM;
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy for Bus
public class BusStrategy implements TransportationStrategy {
    private static final double COST_PER_KM = 0.3;

    @Override
    public double calculateCost(double distance) {
        return distance * COST_PER_KM;
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy for Bicycle
public class BicycleStrategy implements TransportationStrategy {
    private static final double COST_PER_KM = 0.1;

    @Override
    public double calculateCost(double distance) {
        return distance * COST_PER_KM;
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Context Class

The Context class will maintain a reference to the current Strategy object and delegate the calculation of the cost to the Strategy.

```java
// Context Class
public class TripCostCalculator {
    private TransportationStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(TransportationStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public double calculateCost(double distance) {
        if (strategy == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Transportation strategy not set.");
        }
        return strategy.calculateCost(distance);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Demonstrate the Strategy Pattern in Action

Finally, let's demonstrate how the Strategy Pattern allows us to switch between different transportation strategies seamlessly.

```java
public class StrategyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TripCostCalculator calculator = new TripCostCalculator();

        // Set strategy to Car and calculate cost
        calculator.setStrategy(new CarStrategy());
        System.out.println("Car cost: " + calculator.calculateCost(100));

        // Set strategy to Bus and calculate cost
        calculator.setStrategy(new BusStrategy());
        System.out.println("Bus cost: " + calculator.calculateCost(100));

        // Set strategy to Bicycle and calculate cost
        calculator.setStrategy(new BicycleStrategy());
        System.out.println("Bicycle cost: " + calculator.calculateCost(100));
    }
}
```

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

To better understand the interaction between the Context and Strategy interfaces, let's visualize the Strategy Pattern using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TransportationStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +calculateCost(double distance) : double
    }

    class CarStrategy {
        +calculateCost(double distance) : double
    }

    class BusStrategy {
        +calculateCost(double distance) : double
    }

    class BicycleStrategy {
        +calculateCost(double distance) : double
    }

    class TripCostCalculator {
        -strategy : TransportationStrategy
        +setStrategy(TransportationStrategy strategy)
        +calculateCost(double distance) : double
    }

    TransportationStrategy <|.. CarStrategy
    TransportationStrategy <|.. BusStrategy
    TransportationStrategy <|.. BicycleStrategy
    TripCostCalculator --> TransportationStrategy
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram illustrates the Strategy Pattern with the `TransportationStrategy` interface, which is implemented by `CarStrategy`, `BusStrategy`, and `BicycleStrategy`. The `TripCostCalculator` class maintains a reference to the `TransportationStrategy` and delegates the calculation of the cost to the strategy.

### Promoting the Open/Closed Principle

The Strategy Pattern is a prime example of adhering to the open/closed principle. By defining a common interface for strategies, the pattern allows new strategies to be added without modifying existing code. This adherence to the open/closed principle promotes flexibility and maintainability in software design.

#### Adding New Strategies

Suppose we want to add a new transportation strategy, such as a train. With the Strategy Pattern, we can easily add this new strategy without altering the existing codebase.

```java
// Concrete Strategy for Train
public class TrainStrategy implements TransportationStrategy {
    private static final double COST_PER_KM = 0.4;

    @Override
    public double calculateCost(double distance) {
        return distance * COST_PER_KM;
    }
}
```

By implementing the `TransportationStrategy` interface, the `TrainStrategy` can be seamlessly integrated into the existing system.

### Try It Yourself

To gain a deeper understanding of the Strategy Pattern, try experimenting with the code examples provided. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Add a New Strategy**: Implement a new transportation strategy, such as a scooter or a plane, and integrate it into the existing system.

2. **Modify the Cost Calculation**: Change the cost calculation logic for one of the strategies and observe how it affects the overall system.

3. **Implement a User Interface**: Create a simple user interface that allows users to select a transportation strategy and calculate the cost of a trip.
