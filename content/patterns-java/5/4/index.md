## 5.4 Functional Interfaces and the `@FunctionalInterface` Annotation

### Introduction

Functional interfaces are a cornerstone of functional programming in Java, introduced with Java 8. They enable the use of lambda expressions and method references, which are pivotal in writing concise and expressive code. This section delves into the concept of functional interfaces, the significance of the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation, and their practical applications in modern Java programming.

### Defining Functional Interfaces

A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. This single abstract method is the target for lambda expressions and method references. Despite having only one abstract method, functional interfaces can have multiple default or static methods.

#### Characteristics of Functional Interfaces

- **Single Abstract Method (SAM):** The defining feature of a functional interface is the presence of exactly one abstract method. This is often referred to as the Single Abstract Method (SAM) principle.
- **Default and Static Methods:** Functional interfaces can include default and static methods, which provide additional functionality without affecting the SAM nature.
- **Compatibility with Lambda Expressions:** The presence of a single abstract method makes functional interfaces compatible with lambda expressions, allowing for more concise and readable code.

### The `@FunctionalInterface` Annotation

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is a marker interface introduced in Java 8. It is not mandatory to use this annotation to define a functional interface, but it serves several important purposes:

- **Documentation:** It provides a clear indication to developers that the interface is intended to be a functional interface.
- **Compiler Enforcement:** The annotation instructs the compiler to enforce the functional interface contract, ensuring that the interface contains exactly one abstract method.
- **Error Prevention:** By using the annotation, developers can prevent accidental addition of abstract methods, which would violate the functional interface contract.

#### Example of a Functional Interface with `@FunctionalInterface`

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int a, int b);

    // Default method
    default void printResult(int result) {
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    // Static method
    static void printWelcome() {
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Calculator!");
    }
}
```

### Commonly Used Functional Interfaces in `java.util.function`

The `java.util.function` package provides a set of standard functional interfaces that are widely used in Java programming. These interfaces facilitate functional programming paradigms and are essential for working with streams and collections.

#### Key Functional Interfaces

1. **Predicate<T>**: Represents a boolean-valued function of one argument.
   - **Example**: `Predicate<String> isEmpty = String::isEmpty;`

2. **Function<T, R>**: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
   - **Example**: `Function<String, Integer> stringLength = String::length;`

3. **Consumer<T>**: Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
   - **Example**: `Consumer<String> print = System.out::println;`

4. **Supplier<T>**: Represents a supplier of results, providing a result without any input.
   - **Example**: `Supplier<Double> randomValue = Math::random;`

5. **BiFunction<T, U, R>**: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
   - **Example**: `BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> add = Integer::sum;`

6. **UnaryOperator<T>**: A specialization of `Function` for operations on a single operand that returns a result of the same type.
   - **Example**: `UnaryOperator<Integer> square = x -> x * x;`

7. **BinaryOperator<T>**: A specialization of `BiFunction` for operations on two operands of the same type.
   - **Example**: `BinaryOperator<Integer> multiply = (a, b) -> a * b;`

### Creating Custom Functional Interfaces

While Java provides a rich set of functional interfaces, there are scenarios where custom functional interfaces are necessary to meet specific requirements.

#### Example of a Custom Functional Interface

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface StringManipulator {
    String manipulate(String input);

    // Default method
    default String reverse(String input) {
        return new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();
    }
}

// Usage with a lambda expression
StringManipulator toUpperCase = String::toUpperCase;
System.out.println(toUpperCase.manipulate("hello")); // Outputs: HELLO
```

### Composing and Chaining Functional Interfaces

Functional interfaces can be composed and chained to perform complex operations. This is achieved using default methods provided in the `java.util.function` package, such as `andThen` and `compose`.

#### Example of Composing Functions

```java
Function<Integer, Integer> multiplyByTwo = x -> x * 2;
Function<Integer, Integer> addThree = x -> x + 3;

// Compose functions
Function<Integer, Integer> multiplyThenAdd = multiplyByTwo.andThen(addThree);
System.out.println(multiplyThenAdd.apply(5)); // Outputs: 13

// Chain functions
Function<Integer, Integer> addThenMultiply = addThree.compose(multiplyByTwo);
System.out.println(addThenMultiply.apply(5)); // Outputs: 16
```

### Functional Interfaces in Design Patterns

Functional interfaces play a crucial role in implementing design patterns, particularly those that benefit from functional programming paradigms.

#### Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. Functional interfaces simplify the implementation of the Command pattern by representing commands as lambda expressions.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

public class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("The light is on");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("The light is off");
    }
}

public class CommandPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Light light = new Light();

        Command switchOn = light::turnOn;
        Command switchOff = light::turnOff;

        switchOn.execute(); // Outputs: The light is on
        switchOff.execute(); // Outputs: The light is off
    }
}
```

#### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing multiple observers to listen to changes in a subject. Functional interfaces can be used to represent observers, making the pattern more flexible and concise.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        observers.forEach(observer -> observer.update(message));
    }
}

public class ObserverPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Subject subject = new Subject();

        Observer observer1 = message -> System.out.println("Observer 1: " + message);
        Observer observer2 = message -> System.out.println("Observer 2: " + message);

        subject.addObserver(observer1);
        subject.addObserver(observer2);

        subject.notifyObservers("Hello Observers!"); 
        // Outputs:
        // Observer 1: Hello Observers!
        // Observer 2: Hello Observers!
    }
}
```

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Use `@FunctionalInterface` Annotation:** Always use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to ensure the interface adheres to the functional interface contract.
- **Leverage Built-in Interfaces:** Utilize the functional interfaces provided in `java.util.function` to avoid reinventing the wheel.
- **Compose Functions:** Use composition methods like `andThen` and `compose` to build complex operations from simple functions.
- **Avoid Overcomplicating:** Keep lambda expressions simple and readable. If a lambda becomes too complex, consider refactoring it into a method reference or a separate method.

### Conclusion

Functional interfaces and the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation are integral to modern Java programming, enabling the use of lambda expressions and method references. They simplify the implementation of design patterns and enhance code readability and maintainability. By understanding and leveraging functional interfaces, developers can write more expressive and efficient Java code.
