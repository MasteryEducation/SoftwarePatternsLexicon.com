## 9.7.3 `CompletableFuture` for Asynchronous Computations

### Introduction to `CompletableFuture`

In the realm of Java programming, handling asynchronous computations has always been a challenging task. With the introduction of `CompletableFuture` in Java 8, developers gained a powerful tool to manage asynchronous tasks more effectively. `CompletableFuture` is a part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and serves as a monad-like construct that simplifies the process of writing non-blocking code. It allows developers to create complex asynchronous pipelines with ease, leveraging functional programming paradigms.

### The Role of `CompletableFuture` in Asynchronous Programming

`CompletableFuture` is designed to represent a future result of an asynchronous computation. It provides a comprehensive API that allows developers to chain and compose asynchronous operations seamlessly. By using `CompletableFuture`, you can write code that is both efficient and easy to understand, avoiding the traditional callback hell associated with asynchronous programming.

#### Key Features of `CompletableFuture`

- **Chaining Operations**: `CompletableFuture` allows you to chain multiple asynchronous operations using methods like `thenApply`, `thenCompose`, and `thenAccept`.
- **Combining Futures**: You can combine multiple `CompletableFuture` instances using methods such as `thenCombine` and `allOf`.
- **Exception Handling**: It provides robust exception handling mechanisms with methods like `handle`, `exceptionally`, and `whenComplete`.
- **Non-blocking**: `CompletableFuture` operations are non-blocking, enabling efficient use of system resources.

### Chaining and Composing Asynchronous Operations

One of the most powerful features of `CompletableFuture` is its ability to chain and compose asynchronous operations. This is achieved through a fluent API that allows you to define a sequence of transformations and actions on the result of a computation.

#### Using `thenApply` and `thenCompose`

- **`thenApply`**: This method is used to apply a function to the result of a `CompletableFuture` once it completes. It is suitable for synchronous transformations.

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42)
    .thenApply(result -> result * 2);

future.thenAccept(System.out::println); // Outputs: 84
```

- **`thenCompose`**: This method is used to chain another `CompletableFuture` based on the result of the current one. It is ideal for asynchronous transformations.

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42)
    .thenCompose(result -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> result * 2));

future.thenAccept(System.out::println); // Outputs: 84
```

#### Handling Results with `thenAccept` and `thenRun`

- **`thenAccept`**: Consumes the result of a `CompletableFuture` without returning a new future.

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello, World!")
    .thenAccept(System.out::println); // Outputs: Hello, World!
```

- **`thenRun`**: Executes a runnable after the `CompletableFuture` completes, without using its result.

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42)
    .thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Computation finished"));
```

### Exception Handling in Asynchronous Code

Handling exceptions in asynchronous code can be tricky, but `CompletableFuture` provides several methods to manage exceptions gracefully.

#### Using `handle`, `exceptionally`, and `whenComplete`

- **`handle`**: This method allows you to handle both the result and the exception of a `CompletableFuture`.

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) throw new RuntimeException("Failed");
    return 42;
}).handle((result, ex) -> {
    if (ex != null) {
        System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.getMessage());
        return 0;
    }
    return result;
});

future.thenAccept(System.out::println);
```

- **`exceptionally`**: This method provides a way to handle exceptions and return a default value.

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) throw new RuntimeException("Failed");
    return 42;
}).exceptionally(ex -> {
    System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.getMessage());
    return 0;
});

future.thenAccept(System.out::println);
```

- **`whenComplete`**: This method allows you to perform an action after the `CompletableFuture` completes, regardless of whether it completed normally or exceptionally.

```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) throw new RuntimeException("Failed");
    return 42;
}).whenComplete((result, ex) -> {
    if (ex != null) {
        System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.getMessage());
    } else {
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
});
```

### Simplifying Callback Management

`CompletableFuture` significantly simplifies callback management by providing a structured way to define asynchronous workflows. Instead of nesting callbacks, you can define a clear sequence of operations, improving code readability and maintainability.

#### Example: Asynchronous Computation Pipeline

Consider a scenario where you need to fetch data from a remote service, process it, and then store the result in a database. Using `CompletableFuture`, you can create a clean and efficient pipeline for this task.

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> fetchDataFromService())
    .thenApply(data -> processData(data))
    .thenAccept(result -> storeResultInDatabase(result))
    .exceptionally(ex -> {
        System.out.println("Error occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
        return null;
    });
```

### Performance Considerations and Thread Management

While `CompletableFuture` provides a powerful abstraction for asynchronous programming, it is essential to consider performance and thread management to ensure efficient execution.

#### Default Executor and Custom Executors

By default, `CompletableFuture` uses the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` for executing tasks. However, for better control over thread management, you can provide a custom executor.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42, executor)
    .thenApplyAsync(result -> result * 2, executor)
    .thenAcceptAsync(System.out::println, executor);

executor.shutdown();
```

#### Best Practices for Performance Optimization

- **Avoid Blocking Operations**: Ensure that the tasks executed by `CompletableFuture` are non-blocking to prevent thread starvation.
- **Use Appropriate Pool Sizes**: Configure thread pools based on the nature of your tasks and the available system resources.
- **Monitor and Tune**: Regularly monitor the performance of your asynchronous tasks and tune the thread pool settings as needed.

### Conclusion

`CompletableFuture` is a versatile and powerful tool for managing asynchronous computations in Java. By leveraging its functional programming capabilities, developers can create efficient and maintainable code that handles complex asynchronous workflows with ease. Understanding how to use `CompletableFuture` effectively is crucial for modern Java developers, enabling them to build responsive and scalable applications.
