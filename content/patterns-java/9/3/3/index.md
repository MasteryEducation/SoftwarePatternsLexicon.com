NetBeans also supports refactoring previews, allowing developers to review changes before applying them.

### Common Refactoring Operations Supported by IDEs

Refactoring operations are essential for maintaining and improving code quality. Here are some common operations supported by IDEs:

- **Rename Variables, Methods, and Classes**: This operation updates all references to a renamed element, ensuring consistency across the codebase.
  
  ```java
  // Before refactoring
  int a = calculateArea(length, width);
  
  // After refactoring
  int area = calculateArea(length, width);
  ```

- **Extract Methods or Classes**: This operation helps in breaking down large methods into smaller, more manageable pieces, improving readability and reusability.

  ```java
  // Before refactoring
  public void processOrder(Order order) {
      // Code to validate order
      // Code to calculate total
      // Code to apply discounts
  }
  
  // After refactoring
  public void processOrder(Order order) {
      validateOrder(order);
      calculateTotal(order);
      applyDiscounts(order);
  }
  ```

- **Inline Variables or Methods**: This operation replaces a variable or method with its value or implementation, reducing unnecessary indirection.

  ```java
  // Before refactoring
  int result = multiply(a, b);
  
  // After refactoring
  int result = a * b;
  ```

- **Move or Copy Classes and Interfaces**: This operation allows developers to reorganize code by moving or copying classes and interfaces to different packages, improving modularity.

- **Change Method Signatures**: This operation enables developers to modify method parameters and return types, updating all calls to the method to reflect the changes.

### Maintaining Code References and Dependencies

One of the key advantages of using refactoring tools is their ability to maintain code references and dependencies. These tools automatically update all occurrences of a refactored element, ensuring that the codebase remains consistent and error-free. This capability is particularly important in large codebases where manual updates would be time-consuming and error-prone.

### Static Code Analysis Tools and Plugins

In addition to IDEs, static code analysis tools and plugins play a crucial role in identifying code smells and suggesting refactoring opportunities. Some popular tools include:

- **SonarLint**: A plugin that provides real-time feedback on code quality issues directly within the IDE. It highlights code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, offering suggestions for improvement.

- **PMD**: A static code analysis tool that scans Java code for potential issues such as unused variables, empty catch blocks, and overly complex methods. PMD can be integrated into build processes to enforce coding standards.

- **Checkstyle**: A tool that checks Java code against a set of coding standards, helping developers maintain consistent code quality across projects.

These tools complement IDE refactoring features by providing additional insights into code quality and potential improvement areas.

### Automated Refactoring Libraries and Frameworks

Automated refactoring libraries and frameworks can be integrated into build processes to streamline refactoring tasks. These tools automate repetitive refactoring operations, allowing developers to focus on more complex design improvements. Some notable tools include:

- **JRebel**: A Java development tool that allows developers to see code changes instantly without restarting the application. While not a traditional refactoring tool, JRebel enhances the development workflow by reducing turnaround time.

- **Lombok**: A Java library that reduces boilerplate code by generating common methods such as getters, setters, and equals/hashCode at compile time. Lombok simplifies code maintenance and refactoring by minimizing repetitive code.

### Refactoring Workflows Using IDE Features

To illustrate the power of IDE refactoring tools, let's walk through a typical refactoring workflow using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. **Identify the Refactoring Opportunity**: Use static code analysis tools like SonarLint to identify code smells or areas for improvement.
