## 9.3.2 Applying Design Patterns in Refactoring

Refactoring is a crucial process in software development that involves restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The goal is to improve the code's structure, readability, and maintainability. Design patterns, which are proven solutions to common design problems, can play a significant role in refactoring by providing a framework for addressing design issues effectively.

### Understanding Design Patterns in Refactoring

Design patterns are not just about code reuse; they encapsulate best practices and provide a shared language for developers to communicate complex design ideas succinctly. When applied during refactoring, design patterns can transform a tangled codebase into a more modular, flexible, and understandable system.

#### Benefits of Applying Design Patterns in Refactoring

1. **Improved Modularity and Flexibility**: Design patterns help break down monolithic code structures into smaller, more manageable components. This modularity facilitates easier updates and extensions.

2. **Easier Maintenance and Extension**: By organizing code into well-defined patterns, developers can more easily identify where changes need to be made, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

3. **Enhanced Readability and Communication**: Patterns provide a common vocabulary that makes it easier for teams to understand and discuss the architecture of a system.

### Refactoring Scenarios with Design Patterns

Let's explore some common refactoring scenarios where design patterns can be particularly beneficial.

#### Replacing Conditional Logic with the Strategy Pattern

Conditional logic can often lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code. The Strategy pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

**Before Refactoring:**

```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(String paymentType) {
        if (paymentType.equals("CreditCard")) {
            // Process credit card payment
        } else if (paymentType.equals("PayPal")) {
            // Process PayPal payment
        } else if (paymentType.equals("Bitcoin")) {
            // Process Bitcoin payment
        }
    }
}
```

**After Refactoring with Strategy Pattern:**

```java
// Strategy Interface
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay();
}

// Concrete Strategies
class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay() {
        // Process credit card payment
    }
}

class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay() {
        // Process PayPal payment
    }
}

class BitcoinPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay() {
        // Process Bitcoin payment
    }
}

// Context
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentStrategy strategy;

    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void processPayment() {
        strategy.pay();
    }
}
```

**Try It Yourself**: Experiment by adding a new payment method, such as `ApplePayPayment`, and see how easily it integrates into the existing structure.

#### Simplifying Complex Inheritance with Composition and the Decorator Pattern

Inheritance can lead to rigid and complex hierarchies. The Decorator pattern, which favors composition over inheritance, allows for dynamic behavior extension.

**Before Refactoring:**

```java
public class Coffee {
    public double cost() {
        return 5.0;
    }
}

public class MilkCoffee extends Coffee {
    public double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 1.5;
    }
}

public class SugarMilkCoffee extends MilkCoffee {
    public double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 0.5;
    }
}
```

**After Refactoring with Decorator Pattern:**

```java
// Component Interface
interface Coffee {
    double cost();
}

// Concrete Component
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    public double cost() {
        return 5.0;
    }
}

// Decorator
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost();
    }
}

// Concrete Decorators
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 1.5;
    }
}

class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 0.5;
    }
}
```

**Try It Yourself**: Add a new decorator, such as `VanillaDecorator`, and apply it to a `SimpleCoffee` to see how the cost changes.

#### Encapsulating Object Creation with Factory Patterns

Direct instantiation of objects can lead to tight coupling. Factory patterns provide a way to encapsulate object creation, promoting loose coupling.

**Before Refactoring:**

```java
public class NotificationService {
    public void sendNotification(String type) {
        if (type.equals("Email")) {
            new EmailNotification().send();
        } else if (type.equals("SMS")) {
            new SMSNotification().send();
        }
    }
}
```

**After Refactoring with Factory Method Pattern:**

```java
// Product Interface
interface Notification {
    void send();
}

// Concrete Products
class EmailNotification implements Notification {
    public void send() {
        // Send email notification
    }
}

class SMSNotification implements Notification {
    public void send() {
        // Send SMS notification
    }
}

// Creator
abstract class NotificationFactory {
    public abstract Notification createNotification();

    public void sendNotification() {
        Notification notification = createNotification();
        notification.send();
    }
}

// Concrete Creators
class EmailNotificationFactory extends NotificationFactory {
    public Notification createNotification() {
        return new EmailNotification();
    }
}

class SMSNotificationFactory extends NotificationFactory {
    public Notification createNotification() {
        return new SMSNotification();
    }
}
```

**Try It Yourself**: Implement a new `PushNotificationFactory` and see how it fits into the existing factory structure.

### Avoiding Overuse of Design Patterns

While design patterns offer numerous benefits, it's essential to avoid overusing them. Applying a pattern without a justified need can lead to unnecessary complexity. Always consider whether a pattern genuinely addresses the design issue at hand.

### Thoughtful Consideration of Patterns

When refactoring, carefully evaluate which pattern best suits the specific problem. Consider factors such as the pattern's intent, the complexity it introduces, and how it aligns with the overall architecture.

### Evolving Codebase Towards Better Architecture

Design patterns play a pivotal role in evolving a codebase towards a more robust architecture. By systematically applying patterns during refactoring, developers can incrementally improve the design, making the system more adaptable to future changes.
