## 11.3 Building a Web Framework Using Design Patterns

In this section, we'll embark on an exciting journey to build a simple web framework from scratch using Java. Our primary goal is to demonstrate the practical utility of design patterns in framework development. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to leverage design patterns to create a modular, maintainable, and extensible web framework.

### Define Framework Goals

Before we dive into the implementation, let's clearly define the objectives, scope, and features of the mini web framework we aim to develop. Our framework will:

- **Handle HTTP Requests and Responses**: Provide a mechanism to route incoming HTTP requests to appropriate handlers and generate responses.
- **Support MVC Architecture**: Implement the Model-View-Controller pattern to separate concerns and facilitate maintainability.
- **Enable Template Rendering**: Allow dynamic generation of HTML content using templates.
- **Provide a Simple Routing Mechanism**: Map URLs to specific controller actions.
- **Ensure Extensibility**: Design the framework to be easily extendable with additional features.

These goals are achievable within the scope of this educational guide and will provide a solid foundation for understanding web framework development.

### Architectural Overview

To build our web framework, we'll employ several design patterns that are well-suited for this task. Here's a high-level architectural diagram showcasing how different design patterns fit into the framework:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client Request] --> B[Front Controller];
    B --> C[Router];
    C --> D[Controller];
    D --> E[Model];
    D --> F[View];
    F --> G[Template Engine];
    G --> H[Response];
    H --> I[Client Response];
```

#### Explanation of Design Patterns

- **Front Controller Pattern**: Acts as a single entry point for handling all client requests. It delegates requests to appropriate handlers, reducing the complexity of request processing.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: Separates the application into three interconnected components: Model (business logic), View (UI representation), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model).
- **Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's break down the development process into logical steps, each focusing on implementing specific patterns.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

Create a new Java project and set up the necessary directory structure. We'll use Maven for dependency management and build automation.

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.webframework -DartifactId=webframework -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

#### Step 2: Implementing the Front Controller

The Front Controller will serve as the central point for handling all incoming requests. We'll create a `FrontController` class that delegates requests to the appropriate controllers.

```java
// FrontController.java
package com.example.webframework;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FrontController {
    private Map<String, Controller> routes = new HashMap<>();

    public void registerRoute(String path, Controller controller) {
        routes.put(path, controller);
    }

    public void handleRequest(String path) {
        Controller controller = routes.get(path);
        if (controller != null) {
            controller.execute();
        } else {
            System.out.println("404 Not Found");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Defining the Controller Interface

We'll define a `Controller` interface that all controllers will implement. This interface will have an `execute` method that handles the request.

```java
// Controller.java
package com.example.webframework;

public interface Controller {
    void execute();
}
```

#### Step 4: Implementing the MVC Components

Next, we'll implement the MVC components. We'll start with a simple `Model` class that holds data, a `View` class that renders the UI, and a `Controller` class that processes user input.

```java
// Model.java
package com.example.webframework;

public class Model {
    private String data;

    public String getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public void setData(String data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
}

// View.java
package com.example.webframework;

public class View {
    public void render(String data) {
        System.out.println("Rendering view with data: " + data);
    }
}

// SampleController.java
package com.example.webframework;

public class SampleController implements Controller {
    private Model model;
    private View view;

    public SampleController(Model model, View view) {
        this.model = model;
        this.view = view;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        model.setData("Hello, World!");
        view.render(model.getData());
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Implementing the Template Engine

The Template Method pattern will be used in our template engine to allow dynamic content generation. We'll create a `TemplateEngine` class that defines the template rendering process.

```java
// TemplateEngine.java
package com.example.webframework;

public abstract class TemplateEngine {
    public final void renderTemplate(String template, Model model) {
        String content = parseTemplate(template, model);
        System.out.println("Rendering template: " + content);
    }

    protected abstract String parseTemplate(String template, Model model);
}

// SimpleTemplateEngine.java
package com.example.webframework;

public class SimpleTemplateEngine extends TemplateEngine {
    @Override
    protected String parseTemplate(String template, Model model) {
        return template.replace("{{data}}", model.getData());
    }
}
```

### Testing and Validation

Testing is crucial to ensure the framework functions correctly. We'll use JUnit for unit testing our components.

```java
// FrontControllerTest.java
package com.example.webframework;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class FrontControllerTest {
    @Test
    void testHandleRequest() {
        FrontController frontController = new FrontController();
        Model model = new Model();
        View view = new View();
        Controller controller = new SampleController(model, view);

        frontController.registerRoute("/hello", controller);
        frontController.handleRequest("/hello");

        assertEquals("Hello, World!", model.getData());
    }
}
```

### Usage Examples

Let's demonstrate how to build a simple web application using our custom framework. We'll create a main class to initialize the framework and handle requests.

```java
// Main.java
package com.example.webframework;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FrontController frontController = new FrontController();
        Model model = new Model();
        View view = new View();
        Controller controller = new SampleController(model, view);

        frontController.registerRoute("/hello", controller);
        frontController.handleRequest("/hello");
    }
}
```

### Lessons and Best Practices

Reflecting on the development process, we can highlight several lessons and best practices:

- **Modularity**: By using design patterns, we achieved a modular architecture that separates concerns and facilitates maintainability.
- **Extensibility**: The framework is designed to be easily extendable with additional features, such as more complex routing or advanced template engines.
- **Testing**: Writing tests for each component ensures the framework's reliability and helps catch bugs early in the development process.

### Try It Yourself

Encourage experimentation by suggesting modifications to the code examples. Try adding new routes, implementing more complex controllers, or enhancing the template engine with additional features.
