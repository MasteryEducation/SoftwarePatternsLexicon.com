## 4.7.1 Implementing Flyweight in Java

The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern aimed at minimizing memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share common data. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Flyweight pattern in Java, focusing on separating intrinsic and extrinsic states, using a FlyweightFactory, and addressing thread safety concerns.

### Understanding the Flyweight Pattern

The Flyweight pattern is all about sharing. It allows you to create a large number of objects without consuming a lot of memory. The key idea is to separate the intrinsic state, which is shared among objects, from the extrinsic state, which is unique to each object.

#### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State

- **Intrinsic State**: This is the shared state that is common across many objects. It is stored in the flyweight object and is immutable, meaning it does not change over time.
- **Extrinsic State**: This is the unique state that varies from object to object. It is not stored in the flyweight object and must be supplied by the client code.

### Implementing the Flyweight Pattern in Java

Let's dive into a step-by-step guide to implementing the Flyweight pattern in Java.

#### Step 1: Define the Flyweight Interface

The first step is to define an interface for the flyweight objects. This interface will declare methods that accept extrinsic state as arguments.

```java
public interface Flyweight {
    void operation(String extrinsicState);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Flyweight Classes

Next, implement the Flyweight interface in concrete classes. These classes will store the intrinsic state and use the extrinsic state provided by the client.

```java
public class ConcreteFlyweight implements Flyweight {
    private final String intrinsicState;

    public ConcreteFlyweight(String intrinsicState) {
        this.intrinsicState = intrinsicState;
    }

    @Override
    public void operation(String extrinsicState) {
        System.out.println("Intrinsic State: " + intrinsicState + ", Extrinsic State: " + extrinsicState);
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Flyweight Factory

The FlyweightFactory is responsible for creating and managing flyweight objects. It ensures that flyweights are shared properly.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FlyweightFactory {
    private final Map<String, Flyweight> flyweights = new HashMap<>();

    public Flyweight getFlyweight(String intrinsicState) {
        if (!flyweights.containsKey(intrinsicState)) {
            flyweights.put(intrinsicState, new ConcreteFlyweight(intrinsicState));
        }
        return flyweights.get(intrinsicState);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Use the Flyweight Pattern

Now, let's see how to use the Flyweight pattern in a client application.

```java
public class FlyweightPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FlyweightFactory factory = new FlyweightFactory();

        Flyweight flyweight1 = factory.getFlyweight("SharedState1");
        flyweight1.operation("UniqueStateA");

        Flyweight flyweight2 = factory.getFlyweight("SharedState1");
        flyweight2.operation("UniqueStateB");

        Flyweight flyweight3 = factory.getFlyweight("SharedState2");
        flyweight3.operation("UniqueStateC");

        // Verify that flyweight1 and flyweight2 are the same instance
        System.out.println("flyweight1 and flyweight2 are the same instance: " + (flyweight1 == flyweight2));
    }
}
```

### Thread Safety Considerations

When implementing the Flyweight pattern in a multi-threaded environment, thread safety becomes a crucial consideration. The FlyweightFactory must be designed to handle concurrent access, ensuring that flyweights are created and shared safely.

#### Ensuring Thread Safety

To make the FlyweightFactory thread-safe, you can use synchronization mechanisms or concurrent collections provided by Java.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;

public class ThreadSafeFlyweightFactory {
    private final ConcurrentMap<String, Flyweight> flyweights = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public Flyweight getFlyweight(String intrinsicState) {
        return flyweights.computeIfAbsent(intrinsicState, ConcreteFlyweight::new);
    }
}
```

### Best Practices for Efficient Memory Usage

1. **Minimize Intrinsic State**: Keep the intrinsic state as small as possible to maximize sharing.
2. **Immutable Flyweights**: Ensure that flyweight objects are immutable to prevent unintended modifications.
3. **Use Weak References**: Consider using weak references to allow garbage collection of unused flyweights.
4. **Profile and Optimize**: Use profiling tools to identify memory usage patterns and optimize accordingly.

### Visualizing the Flyweight Pattern

To better understand how the Flyweight pattern works, let's visualize the relationship between the FlyweightFactory, flyweight objects, and client code.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Flyweight {
        <<interface>>
        +operation(extrinsicState)
    }

    class ConcreteFlyweight {
        -String intrinsicState
        +operation(extrinsicState)
    }

    class FlyweightFactory {
        -Map~String, Flyweight~ flyweights
        +getFlyweight(intrinsicState) Flyweight
    }

    Flyweight <|.. ConcreteFlyweight
    FlyweightFactory o-- Flyweight
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Flyweight pattern by modifying the code examples:

- **Change Intrinsic State**: Add more intrinsic states and observe how the FlyweightFactory manages them.
- **Add New Flyweight Types**: Implement additional flyweight classes with different intrinsic states.
- **Test Thread Safety**: Simulate concurrent access to the FlyweightFactory and ensure it behaves correctly.
