## 4.7.2 Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State

In the realm of software design patterns, the Flyweight pattern stands out for its ability to optimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This pattern is particularly beneficial when dealing with a large number of objects that share common data. The key to the Flyweight pattern's efficiency lies in its separation of intrinsic and extrinsic states. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively implementing the Flyweight pattern in Java.

### Understanding Intrinsic and Extrinsic State

#### Intrinsic State

Intrinsic state refers to the information that is shared and stored within the flyweight itself. This state is invariant and independent of the flyweight's context. In other words, intrinsic state is the data that remains constant across different instances of the flyweight. By storing this shared data in a single location, the Flyweight pattern minimizes memory usage.

**Example of Intrinsic State:**

Consider a text editor that needs to display a large number of characters on the screen. Each character can be represented as a flyweight object. The intrinsic state of a character might include its font, style, and size, which are common to many instances of the character.

```java
public class CharacterFlyweight {
    private final char symbol;
    private final String font;
    private final int size;

    public CharacterFlyweight(char symbol, String font, int size) {
        this.symbol = symbol;
        this.font = font;
        this.size = size;
    }

    public void display(int x, int y) {
        // Display character at the given position
        System.out.println("Displaying " + symbol + " at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with font " + font + " and size " + size);
    }
}
```

In this example, `symbol`, `font`, and `size` are intrinsic states because they are shared among multiple instances of the same character.

#### Extrinsic State

Extrinsic state, on the other hand, is context-specific information that is supplied by the client. This state is not stored within the flyweight but is passed to it when needed. Extrinsic state allows the flyweight to be used in different contexts without duplicating the shared data.

**Example of Extrinsic State:**

Continuing with the text editor example, the extrinsic state for a character might include its position on the screen. This information is unique to each instance of the character and is provided by the client when the character is displayed.

```java
public class CharacterClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CharacterFlyweightFactory factory = new CharacterFlyweightFactory();
        
        CharacterFlyweight a = factory.getCharacter('A', "Arial", 12);
        a.display(10, 20); // Extrinsic state: position (10, 20)

        CharacterFlyweight b = factory.getCharacter('B', "Arial", 12);
        b.display(15, 25); // Extrinsic state: position (15, 25)

        CharacterFlyweight a2 = factory.getCharacter('A', "Arial", 12);
        a2.display(30, 40); // Extrinsic state: position (30, 40)
    }
}
```

In this example, the position `(x, y)` is the extrinsic state provided by the client when calling the `display` method.

### Separating Intrinsic and Extrinsic State

The separation of intrinsic and extrinsic states is fundamental to the Flyweight pattern's efficiency. By isolating the shared data (intrinsic state) from the context-specific data (extrinsic state), flyweights can be reused across different contexts, significantly reducing memory consumption.

#### Practical Implementation

To implement the Flyweight pattern effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Shared Data**: Determine which parts of the object's state can be shared across multiple instances. This data will form the intrinsic state.

2. **Create Flyweight Objects**: Implement flyweight objects that store the intrinsic state. These objects should be lightweight and immutable.

3. **Manage Extrinsic State**: Ensure that extrinsic state is provided by the client when invoking methods on the flyweight. This state should not be stored within the flyweight.

4. **Use a Factory for Flyweight Creation**: Implement a factory to manage the creation and reuse of flyweight objects. The factory should return existing flyweights when possible, rather than creating new ones.

**Flyweight Factory Example:**

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CharacterFlyweightFactory {
    private final Map<String, CharacterFlyweight> flyweights = new HashMap<>();

    public CharacterFlyweight getCharacter(char symbol, String font, int size) {
        String key = symbol + font + size;
        if (!flyweights.containsKey(key)) {
            flyweights.put(key, new CharacterFlyweight(symbol, font, size));
        }
        return flyweights.get(key);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CharacterFlyweightFactory` manages the creation and reuse of `CharacterFlyweight` objects. It uses a `HashMap` to store existing flyweights and returns them when requested, ensuring that new objects are only created when necessary.

### Benefits of Intrinsic and Extrinsic State Separation

The separation of intrinsic and extrinsic states offers several advantages:

- **Memory Efficiency**: By sharing intrinsic state, the Flyweight pattern reduces the memory footprint of applications that require a large number of similar objects.

- **Flexibility**: Extrinsic state allows flyweights to be used in various contexts without duplicating shared data. This flexibility is particularly useful in applications with dynamic or frequently changing contexts.

- **Scalability**: The Flyweight pattern enables applications to scale efficiently by minimizing the resources required to manage large numbers of objects.

### Importance of Client-Supplied Extrinsic State

In the Flyweight pattern, it is crucial for clients to supply the extrinsic state when invoking methods on flyweights. This requirement ensures that the flyweight can operate correctly in its specific context without storing unnecessary data.

#### Example of Client-Supplied Extrinsic State

Consider a graphical application that uses the Flyweight pattern to render a large number of shapes. Each shape has intrinsic properties such as color and texture, while its position and orientation are extrinsic.

```java
public class ShapeFlyweight {
    private final String color;
    private final String texture;

    public ShapeFlyweight(String color, String texture) {
        this.color = color;
        this.texture = texture;
    }

    public void render(int x, int y, double angle) {
        // Render shape at the given position and orientation
        System.out.println("Rendering shape at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with angle " + angle + ", color " + color + ", and texture " + texture);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `render` method requires the client to provide the extrinsic state `(x, y, angle)` to render the shape correctly.

### Visualizing Intrinsic and Extrinsic State

To better understand the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic states, let's visualize the Flyweight pattern using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Flyweight {
        +display(int x, int y)
    }
    class ConcreteFlyweight {
        -char symbol
        -String font
        -int size
        +display(int x, int y)
    }
    class FlyweightFactory {
        -Map~String, Flyweight~ flyweights
        +getCharacter(char symbol, String font, int size) Flyweight
    }
    Flyweight <|-- ConcreteFlyweight
    FlyweightFactory --> Flyweight
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Flyweight**: An abstract class or interface that defines the `display` method, which requires extrinsic state as parameters.

- **ConcreteFlyweight**: A class that implements the `Flyweight` interface and stores intrinsic state such as `symbol`, `font`, and `size`.

- **FlyweightFactory**: A class that manages the creation and reuse of `ConcreteFlyweight` objects, storing them in a `Map` for efficient retrieval.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic states in the Flyweight pattern, try modifying the code examples provided. Experiment with different intrinsic states, such as adding new properties to the `CharacterFlyweight` or `ShapeFlyweight` classes. Observe how these changes affect memory usage and performance.

### Knowledge Check
