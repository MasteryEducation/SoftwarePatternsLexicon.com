## 4.5.1 Implementing Decorator in Java

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to add responsibilities to objects without subclassing, thus promoting flexibility and reusability in your code.

### Understanding the Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. The key idea is to create a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

#### Key Concepts

- **Component Interface**: This defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
- **Concrete Component**: This is the class that we want to add new behavior to.
- **Decorator**: This abstract class implements the component interface and has a reference to a component object. It delegates all component methods to the component object.
- **Concrete Decorators**: These are the classes that extend the decorator class and add additional behavior.

### Implementing the Decorator Pattern in Java

Let's walk through the implementation of the Decorator Pattern in Java with a practical example. We'll create a simple coffee shop application where we can dynamically add ingredients to a coffee order.

#### Step 1: Define the Component Interface

The first step is to define a `Coffee` interface that will be implemented by both the concrete component and the decorators.

```java
// Component Interface
public interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Concrete Component

Next, we create a `SimpleCoffee` class that implements the `Coffee` interface. This class represents a basic coffee without any additional ingredients.

```java
// Concrete Component
public class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return 5.0;
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Decorator Abstract Class

The `CoffeeDecorator` class implements the `Coffee` interface and holds a reference to a `Coffee` object. It delegates the method calls to the wrapped `Coffee` object.

```java
// Decorator
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Concrete Decorators

Now, we create concrete decorators that extend the `CoffeeDecorator` class. These decorators add additional functionality to the coffee.

```java
// Concrete Decorator
public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost() + 1.5;
    }
}

// Another Concrete Decorator
public class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost() + 0.5;
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Combine Decorators

To use the decorators, we create a `SimpleCoffee` object and wrap it with the desired decorators.

```java
public class CoffeeShop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());

        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());

        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Component Interface**: The `Coffee` interface defines the methods that both the concrete component and decorators must implement.
- **Concrete Component**: The `SimpleCoffee` class provides a basic implementation of the `Coffee` interface.
- **Decorator Class**: The `CoffeeDecorator` abstract class implements the `Coffee` interface and holds a reference to a `Coffee` object. It provides default implementations for the methods by delegating them to the wrapped object.
- **Concrete Decorators**: The `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` classes extend `CoffeeDecorator` and override the methods to add their specific behavior.

### Adding New Behaviors

To add new behaviors, simply create new decorator classes that extend the `CoffeeDecorator` class. For example, you can create a `WhippedCreamDecorator` to add whipped cream to the coffee.

```java
// New Concrete Decorator
public class WhippedCreamDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public WhippedCreamDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Whipped Cream";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost() + 2.0;
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Conform to Component Interface**: Ensure that all decorators conform to the component interface. This allows decorators to be used interchangeably with components.
- **Single Responsibility**: Keep decorators focused on a single responsibility. This makes them easier to maintain and extend.
- **Lightweight Decorators**: Avoid adding unnecessary complexity to decorators. They should be lightweight and focused on adding specific behavior.

### Visualizing the Decorator Pattern

Below is a class diagram that illustrates the relationships between the component, decorators, and concrete decorators.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Coffee {
        <<interface>>
        +String getDescription()
        +double getCost()
    }

    class SimpleCoffee {
        +String getDescription()
        +double getCost()
    }

    class CoffeeDecorator {
        +Coffee coffee
        +String getDescription()
        +double getCost()
    }

    class MilkDecorator {
        +String getDescription()
        +double getCost()
    }

    class SugarDecorator {
        +String getDescription()
        +double getCost()
    }

    class WhippedCreamDecorator {
        +String getDescription()
        +double getCost()
    }

    Coffee <|.. SimpleCoffee
    Coffee <|.. CoffeeDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- MilkDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- SugarDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- WhippedCreamDecorator
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by adding new decorators or modifying existing ones. Here are some suggestions:

- **Create a `VanillaDecorator`**: Add a new decorator that adds vanilla flavor to the coffee.
- **Modify the `SugarDecorator`**: Change the cost of sugar or add a new method to specify the amount of sugar.
- **Chain Multiple Decorators**: Try combining multiple decorators in different orders and observe how it affects the final output.
