## 4.8.2 Types of Proxies

In the world of software design patterns, the Proxy Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where direct access to an object is either not feasible or not desirable. Proxies can serve various purposes, such as controlling access, adding additional functionality, or optimizing resource usage. In this section, we will explore four main types of proxies: Virtual Proxy, Remote Proxy, Protection Proxy, and Smart Reference. Each type serves a unique purpose and can be applied in different contexts to solve specific problems.

### Virtual Proxy

**Definition**: A Virtual Proxy is used to control access to resource-intensive objects. It delays the creation and initialization of these objects until they are actually needed, thereby optimizing resource usage and improving performance.

**Use Case**: Imagine an application that loads high-resolution images from a disk. Loading all images at once can be resource-intensive and slow down the application. A Virtual Proxy can be used to load images on demand, only when they are needed for display.

**Example**: Let's consider a scenario where we have a `HighResolutionImage` class that represents a large image file. We can use a Virtual Proxy to manage the loading of this image.

```java
// The Subject interface
interface Image {
    void display();
}

// RealSubject class that represents the actual image
class HighResolutionImage implements Image {
    private String fileName;

    public HighResolutionImage(String fileName) {
        this.fileName = fileName;
        loadImageFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadImageFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading " + fileName);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + fileName);
    }
}

// Proxy class that controls access to the real image
class ImageProxy implements Image {
    private HighResolutionImage highResolutionImage;
    private String fileName;

    public ImageProxy(String fileName) {
        this.fileName = fileName;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (highResolutionImage == null) {
            highResolutionImage = new HighResolutionImage(fileName);
        }
        highResolutionImage.display();
    }
}

// Client code
public class ProxyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image = new ImageProxy("test_image.jpg");
        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image.display();
        // Image will not be loaded from disk again
        image.display();
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Lazy Initialization**: The object is created only when it is needed, saving resources.
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduces the initial load time by deferring the creation of resource-intensive objects.

**Considerations**:
- **Complexity**: Introduces additional complexity in the codebase.
- **Synchronization**: In a multi-threaded environment, care must be taken to ensure thread safety.

### Remote Proxy

**Definition**: A Remote Proxy represents an object located in a different address space, typically on a different machine. It is used to communicate with remote objects as if they were local.

**Use Case**: Remote Proxies are commonly used in distributed systems where objects need to interact across network boundaries. For instance, a client application might use a Remote Proxy to interact with a service hosted on a remote server.

**Example**: Consider a scenario where a client application needs to interact with a remote service to fetch data.

```java
// The Subject interface
interface DataService {
    String fetchData();
}

// RealSubject class that represents the remote service
class RemoteDataService implements DataService {
    @Override
    public String fetchData() {
        return "Data from remote service";
    }
}

// Proxy class that represents the remote service
class RemoteDataProxy implements DataService {
    private RemoteDataService remoteDataService;

    @Override
    public String fetchData() {
        if (remoteDataService == null) {
            remoteDataService = new RemoteDataService();
        }
        return remoteDataService.fetchData();
    }
}

// Client code
public class RemoteProxyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataService dataService = new RemoteDataProxy();
        System.out.println(dataService.fetchData());
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Abstraction**: Hides the complexity of network communication from the client.
- **Location Transparency**: Allows clients to interact with remote objects as if they were local.

**Considerations**:
- **Network Latency**: Communication over a network can introduce latency.
- **Error Handling**: Network failures and exceptions need to be handled gracefully.

### Protection Proxy

**Definition**: A Protection Proxy controls access to an object based on access rights. It is used to enforce security policies and manage permissions.

**Use Case**: Protection Proxies are useful in scenarios where access to sensitive data or operations needs to be restricted based on user roles or permissions.

**Example**: Let's consider a scenario where we have a `Document` class that represents a sensitive document. We can use a Protection Proxy to manage access to this document.

```java
// The Subject interface
interface Document {
    void displayContent();
}

// RealSubject class that represents the actual document
class SensitiveDocument implements Document {
    private String content;

    public SensitiveDocument(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    @Override
    public void displayContent() {
        System.out.println("Document Content: " + content);
    }
}

// Proxy class that controls access to the document
class DocumentProxy implements Document {
    private SensitiveDocument sensitiveDocument;
    private String userRole;

    public DocumentProxy(String content, String userRole) {
        this.sensitiveDocument = new SensitiveDocument(content);
        this.userRole = userRole;
    }

    @Override
    public void displayContent() {
        if ("ADMIN".equals(userRole)) {
            sensitiveDocument.displayContent();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access Denied: Insufficient permissions");
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class ProtectionProxyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document document = new DocumentProxy("Confidential Document", "USER");
        document.displayContent(); // Access Denied

        Document adminDocument = new DocumentProxy("Confidential Document", "ADMIN");
        adminDocument.displayContent(); // Access Granted
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Security**: Enforces access control policies and protects sensitive data.
- **Flexibility**: Allows dynamic permission checks based on user roles.

**Considerations**:
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional checks can introduce performance overhead.
- **Complexity**: Managing access rights can increase code complexity.

### Smart Reference

**Definition**: A Smart Reference Proxy adds additional actions when an object is accessed. It can be used to perform operations such as logging, reference counting, or caching.

**Use Case**: Smart References are useful in scenarios where additional actions need to be performed automatically when an object is accessed, such as logging access times or maintaining usage statistics.

**Example**: Consider a scenario where we have a `Resource` class that represents a shared resource. We can use a Smart Reference to log access to this resource.

```java
// The Subject interface
interface Resource {
    void access();
}

// RealSubject class that represents the actual resource
class SharedResource implements Resource {
    @Override
    public void access() {
        System.out.println("Accessing shared resource");
    }
}

// Proxy class that adds additional actions
class SmartResourceProxy implements Resource {
    private SharedResource sharedResource;

    public SmartResourceProxy() {
        this.sharedResource = new SharedResource();
    }

    @Override
    public void access() {
        logAccess();
        sharedResource.access();
    }

    private void logAccess() {
        System.out.println("Logging access to resource");
    }
}

// Client code
public class SmartReferenceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource resource = new SmartResourceProxy();
        resource.access(); // Logs access and accesses the resource
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Additional Functionality**: Automatically performs actions such as logging or caching.
- **Transparency**: The client code remains unaware of the additional actions.

**Considerations**:
- **Overhead**: Additional actions can introduce performance overhead.
- **Complexity**: Managing additional functionality can increase code complexity.

### Visualizing Proxy Types

To better understand the relationships and interactions between different types of proxies, let's visualize the structure using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Image {
        <<interface>>
        +display()
    }
    class HighResolutionImage {
        +display()
        +loadImageFromDisk()
    }
    class ImageProxy {
        +display()
    }
    Image <|.. HighResolutionImage
    Image <|.. ImageProxy
    ImageProxy o-- HighResolutionImage

    class DataService {
        <<interface>>
        +fetchData()
    }
    class RemoteDataService {
        +fetchData()
    }
    class RemoteDataProxy {
        +fetchData()
    }
    DataService <|.. RemoteDataService
    DataService <|.. RemoteDataProxy
    RemoteDataProxy o-- RemoteDataService

    class Document {
        <<interface>>
        +displayContent()
    }
    class SensitiveDocument {
        +displayContent()
    }
    class DocumentProxy {
        +displayContent()
    }
    Document <|.. SensitiveDocument
    Document <|.. DocumentProxy
    DocumentProxy o-- SensitiveDocument

    class Resource {
        <<interface>>
        +access()
    }
    class SharedResource {
        +access()
    }
    class SmartResourceProxy {
        +access()
        +logAccess()
    }
    Resource <|.. SharedResource
    Resource <|.. SmartResourceProxy
    SmartResourceProxy o-- SharedResource
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram illustrates the relationships between the interface, real subject, and proxy classes for each type of proxy. The proxy classes implement the same interface as the real subject, ensuring that they can be used interchangeably by the client.
