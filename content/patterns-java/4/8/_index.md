## 4.8 Proxy Pattern

### Introduction to the Proxy Pattern

In the realm of software design, the Proxy Pattern stands out as a powerful structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is particularly useful when direct access to an object is either undesirable or impractical. By introducing a level of indirection, the Proxy Pattern allows for additional functionalities such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, and more.

### Problem Statement

Imagine a scenario where you have a resource-intensive object, such as a large image or a complex network connection. Instantiating such an object directly might be costly in terms of performance or memory usage. Additionally, there might be situations where you need to control access to sensitive resources, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with them. The Proxy Pattern addresses these challenges by providing a controlled interface to the underlying object, thereby enhancing flexibility and security.

### Structure of the Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern involves three main components:

1. **Subject**: This is an interface that defines the common operations for both the RealSubject and the Proxy. It ensures that the Proxy can be used interchangeably with the RealSubject.

2. **RealSubject**: This is the actual object that the Proxy represents. It contains the core functionality that clients are interested in.

3. **Proxy**: This acts as an intermediary between the client and the RealSubject. It controls access to the RealSubject and may add additional behavior.

#### UML Diagram

To better understand the interactions between these components, let's visualize the Proxy Pattern using a UML diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        <<interface>>
        +request()
    }

    class RealSubject {
        +request()
    }

    class Proxy {
        -realSubject: RealSubject
        +request()
    }

    Subject <|.. RealSubject
    Subject <|.. Proxy
    Proxy --> RealSubject
```

**Diagram Description**: The UML diagram illustrates the relationship between the Subject interface, the RealSubject, and the Proxy. The Proxy holds a reference to the RealSubject and implements the Subject interface, allowing it to be used in place of the RealSubject.

### Types of Proxies

The Proxy Pattern can be implemented in various forms, each serving a different purpose:

1. **Virtual Proxy**: This type of proxy is used to manage the creation and initialization of resource-intensive objects. It defers the creation of the RealSubject until it is absolutely necessary.

2. **Remote Proxy**: This proxy represents an object located in a different address space, such as on a different machine. It handles the communication between the client and the remote object.

3. **Protection Proxy**: This proxy controls access to the RealSubject by checking permissions or credentials before allowing operations.

4. **Smart Reference Proxy**: This proxy adds additional behavior when an object is accessed, such as reference counting, logging, or access tracking.

### Practical Implementation Strategies

When implementing the Proxy Pattern in Java, consider the following strategies:

- **Interface Implementation**: Ensure that the Proxy and RealSubject implement a common interface, allowing them to be used interchangeably.
  
- **Lazy Initialization**: In a Virtual Proxy, delay the creation of the RealSubject until it is needed, improving performance and resource utilization.

- **Access Control**: In a Protection Proxy, implement security checks to verify user permissions before delegating requests to the RealSubject.

- **Remote Communication**: In a Remote Proxy, handle network communication and serialization to interact with remote objects seamlessly.

### Example: Virtual Proxy

Let's explore a practical example of a Virtual Proxy in Java. Consider a scenario where we have a large image that should only be loaded when it's actually needed.

```java
// Subject interface
interface Image {
    void display();
}

// RealSubject class
class RealImage implements Image {
    private String fileName;

    public RealImage(String fileName) {
        this.fileName = fileName;
        loadFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading " + fileName);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + fileName);
    }
}

// Proxy class
class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private RealImage realImage;
    private String fileName;

    public ProxyImage(String fileName) {
        this.fileName = fileName;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(fileName);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}

// Client code
public class ProxyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image = new ProxyImage("test_image.jpg");
        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image.display();
        // Image will not be loaded from disk again
        image.display();
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: In this example, the `ProxyImage` class acts as a virtual proxy for the `RealImage` class. The `RealImage` is only loaded from disk when the `display` method is called for the first time, demonstrating lazy initialization.

### Example: Protection Proxy

Consider a scenario where access to certain operations needs to be restricted based on user roles. A Protection Proxy can be used to enforce these restrictions.

```java
// Subject interface
interface Document {
    void displayContent();
}

// RealSubject class
class SecureDocument implements Document {
    private String content;

    public SecureDocument(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    @Override
    public void displayContent() {
        System.out.println("Content: " + content);
    }
}

// Proxy class
class DocumentProxy implements Document {
    private SecureDocument secureDocument;
    private String userRole;

    public DocumentProxy(String content, String userRole) {
        this.secureDocument = new SecureDocument(content);
        this.userRole = userRole;
    }

    @Override
    public void displayContent() {
        if ("ADMIN".equals(userRole)) {
            secureDocument.displayContent();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access Denied: Insufficient permissions.");
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class ProtectionProxyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document document = new DocumentProxy("Top Secret Document", "USER");
        document.displayContent(); // Access Denied

        Document adminDocument = new DocumentProxy("Top Secret Document", "ADMIN");
        adminDocument.displayContent(); // Content displayed
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: In this example, the `DocumentProxy` class checks the user's role before allowing access to the `SecureDocument`. This ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can view the document content.

### Example: Remote Proxy

A Remote Proxy is useful when dealing with objects located on different machines. It abstracts the complexities of network communication.

```java
// Subject interface
interface RemoteService {
    String fetchData();
}

// RealSubject class
class RealRemoteService implements RemoteService {
    @Override
    public String fetchData() {
        return "Data from remote service";
    }
}

// Proxy class
class RemoteServiceProxy implements RemoteService {
    private RealRemoteService realRemoteService;

    @Override
    public String fetchData() {
        if (realRemoteService == null) {
            realRemoteService = new RealRemoteService();
        }
        // Simulate network communication
        System.out.println("Fetching data through proxy...");
        return realRemoteService.fetchData();
    }
}

// Client code
public class RemoteProxyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RemoteService service = new RemoteServiceProxy();
        System.out.println(service.fetchData());
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: In this example, the `RemoteServiceProxy` acts as a stand-in for the `RealRemoteService`, simulating network communication. This allows the client to interact with the remote service as if it were local.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by making the following modifications:

- **Virtual Proxy**: Add a method to the `RealImage` class that simulates a time-consuming operation, such as applying a filter, and observe how the Proxy delays this operation until necessary.

- **Protection Proxy**: Extend the `DocumentProxy` to support multiple user roles with different access levels, such as "VIEWER" and "EDITOR", and implement corresponding access controls.

- **Remote Proxy**: Simulate network latency in the `RemoteServiceProxy` by introducing a delay before fetching data, and observe how this affects the client experience.

### Visualizing Proxy Types

To further illustrate the different types of proxies, let's use a sequence diagram to show how a client interacts with a Remote Proxy.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy
    participant RealSubject

    Client->>Proxy: fetchData()
    Proxy->>RealSubject: fetchData()
    RealSubject-->>Proxy: return data
    Proxy-->>Client: return data
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram shows the interaction between the client, the proxy, and the real subject in a Remote Proxy scenario. The client requests data through the proxy, which then communicates with the real subject to retrieve the data.
