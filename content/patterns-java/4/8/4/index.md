## 4.8.4 Proxy vs. Decorator Pattern

In the realm of software design patterns, the Proxy and Decorator patterns are often discussed together due to their structural similarities. Both patterns involve wrapping an object to extend its functionality, but they serve distinct purposes and are used in different contexts. Understanding the nuances between these two patterns is crucial for expert software engineers who aim to write maintainable and scalable code.

### Understanding the Proxy Pattern

**Proxy Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The proxy object acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object, allowing for additional functionality such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching.

#### Key Characteristics of Proxy Pattern

- **Control Access**: The primary purpose of a proxy is to control access to the real object. This can involve checking permissions, managing resource usage, or delaying object creation until it's needed.
- **Interface Consistency**: The proxy implements the same interface as the real object, ensuring that the client can interact with the proxy as if it were the real object.
- **Types of Proxies**: Common types include virtual proxies (for lazy loading), protection proxies (for access control), and remote proxies (for accessing objects in different address spaces).

#### Example: Virtual Proxy in Java

Let's consider a scenario where we have a large image that is expensive to load. We can use a virtual proxy to delay the loading of the image until it is actually needed.

```java
interface Image {
    void display();
}

class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading " + filename);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + filename);
    }
}

class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private RealImage realImage;
    private String filename;

    public ProxyImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}

public class ProxyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image = new ProxyImage("test.jpg");
        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image.display();
        // Image will not be loaded from disk
        image.display();
    }
}
```

In this example, `ProxyImage` controls the access to `RealImage`, loading it only when necessary.

### Understanding the Decorator Pattern

**Decorator Pattern** is another structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often used to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.

#### Key Characteristics of Decorator Pattern

- **Add Responsibilities**: The primary purpose of a decorator is to add new responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Flexible Composition**: Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Interface Consistency**: Like proxies, decorators implement the same interface as the objects they decorate, ensuring that they can be used interchangeably.

#### Example: Decorator Pattern in Java

Consider a scenario where we want to add additional features to a simple coffee order. We can use decorators to add milk, sugar, or other ingredients.

```java
interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}

class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return 5.0;
    }
}

abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost();
    }
}

class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost() + 1.5;
    }
}

class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost() + 0.5;
    }
}

public class DecoratorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.getCost());

        Coffee milkCoffee = new MilkDecorator(new SimpleCoffee());
        System.out.println(milkCoffee.getDescription() + " $" + milkCoffee.getCost());

        Coffee sugarMilkCoffee = new SugarDecorator(new MilkDecorator(new SimpleCoffee()));
        System.out.println(sugarMilkCoffee.getDescription() + " $" + sugarMilkCoffee.getCost());
    }
}
```

In this example, we use decorators to add milk and sugar to a simple coffee, dynamically enhancing its functionality.

### Comparing Proxy and Decorator Patterns

While both Proxy and Decorator patterns involve wrapping objects, their intents and applications differ significantly.

#### Intent and Purpose

- **Proxy**: The intent is to control access to an object. It acts as an intermediary, adding a layer of control over the object it wraps.
- **Decorator**: The intent is to add new functionality to an object. It enhances or modifies the behavior of the object it wraps.

#### Structural Differences

Let's visualize the structural differences using UML diagrams.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Client {
        -Subject subject
        +request()
    }
    class Subject {
        <<interface>>
        +request()
    }
    class RealSubject {
        +request()
    }
    class Proxy {
        -RealSubject realSubject
        +request()
    }
    Client --> Subject
    Subject <|.. RealSubject
    Subject <|.. Proxy
```

**Diagram 1: Proxy Pattern Structure**

In the Proxy pattern, the `Proxy` class implements the `Subject` interface and controls access to the `RealSubject`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        <<interface>>
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation()
    }
    class Decorator {
        -Component component
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorA {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorB {
        +operation()
    }
    Component <|.. ConcreteComponent
    Component <|.. Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorA
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorB
    Decorator --> Component
```

**Diagram 2: Decorator Pattern Structure**

In the Decorator pattern, the `Decorator` class wraps a `Component` and adds additional behavior.

#### Use Cases

- **Proxy**: Use when you need to control access to an object, such as in lazy loading, access control, logging, or remote access scenarios.
- **Decorator**: Use when you need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically, such as in GUI components, stream processing, or adding features to objects without altering their structure.

#### Design Motivations

- **Proxy**: Motivated by the need to manage access and control over a resource. It is often used to defer resource-intensive operations until necessary.
- **Decorator**: Motivated by the need to extend functionality without modifying existing code. It provides a flexible way to add features to individual objects.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the examples provided:

- **Proxy Pattern**: Implement a protection proxy that checks user permissions before allowing access to a method.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Create additional decorators for the coffee example, such as `VanillaDecorator` or `WhippedCreamDecorator`, and see how they can be combined.
