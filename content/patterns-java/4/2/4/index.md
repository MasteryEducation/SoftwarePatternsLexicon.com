## 4.2.4 Use Cases and Examples

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that enables objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, allowing them to work together without modifying their existing code. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating legacy systems or third-party libraries into a new or existing system. Let's delve into some practical scenarios where the Adapter Pattern shines, along with code examples and diagrams to illustrate its application.

### Real-World Use Cases

#### 1. Adapting Different Logging Frameworks

In large-scale applications, different modules might use various logging frameworks. Standardizing logging across an application can be challenging if each module uses a different framework. The Adapter Pattern can be employed to create a unified logging interface, allowing different logging frameworks to be used interchangeably.

**Why Use the Adapter Pattern?**

- **Uniformity**: It provides a consistent interface for logging across the application.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for easy switching between different logging frameworks without altering the core application logic.
- **Code Reuse**: Encourages reuse of existing logging frameworks without modification.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Target interface
interface Logger {
    void log(String message);
}

// Adaptee 1: A third-party logging framework
class ThirdPartyLogger {
    void writeLog(String msg) {
        System.out.println("ThirdPartyLogger: " + msg);
    }
}

// Adaptee 2: Another logging framework
class AnotherLogger {
    void logMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println("AnotherLogger: " + message);
    }
}

// Adapter for ThirdPartyLogger
class ThirdPartyLoggerAdapter implements Logger {
    private ThirdPartyLogger thirdPartyLogger;

    public ThirdPartyLoggerAdapter(ThirdPartyLogger thirdPartyLogger) {
        this.thirdPartyLogger = thirdPartyLogger;
    }

    @Override
    public void log(String message) {
        thirdPartyLogger.writeLog(message);
    }
}

// Adapter for AnotherLogger
class AnotherLoggerAdapter implements Logger {
    private AnotherLogger anotherLogger;

    public AnotherLoggerAdapter(AnotherLogger anotherLogger) {
        this.anotherLogger = anotherLogger;
    }

    @Override
    public void log(String message) {
        anotherLogger.logMessage(message);
    }
}

// Client code
public class LoggingClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger logger1 = new ThirdPartyLoggerAdapter(new ThirdPartyLogger());
        Logger logger2 = new AnotherLoggerAdapter(new AnotherLogger());

        logger1.log("Logging with ThirdPartyLogger");
        logger2.log("Logging with AnotherLogger");
    }
}
```

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Logger {
        <<interface>>
        + log(String message)
    }
    class ThirdPartyLogger {
        + writeLog(String msg)
    }
    class AnotherLogger {
        + logMessage(String message)
    }
    class ThirdPartyLoggerAdapter {
        - ThirdPartyLogger thirdPartyLogger
        + log(String message)
    }
    class AnotherLoggerAdapter {
        - AnotherLogger anotherLogger
        + log(String message)
    }
    Logger <|.. ThirdPartyLoggerAdapter
    Logger <|.. AnotherLoggerAdapter
    ThirdPartyLoggerAdapter --> ThirdPartyLogger
    AnotherLoggerAdapter --> AnotherLogger
```

### 2. Integrating Incompatible APIs

When developing applications that rely on external APIs, it's common to encounter APIs with varying interfaces. The Adapter Pattern can be used to create a common interface for these APIs, simplifying integration and usage.

**Why Use the Adapter Pattern?**

- **Simplification**: Provides a unified interface for interacting with different APIs.
- **Decoupling**: Reduces direct dependencies on specific API implementations.
- **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to update or replace APIs without affecting the rest of the application.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Target interface for payment processing
interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

// Adaptee 1: PayPal API
class PayPalAPI {
    void sendPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment through PayPal: $" + amount);
    }
}

// Adaptee 2: Stripe API
class StripeAPI {
    void makePayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment through Stripe: $" + amount);
    }
}

// Adapter for PayPalAPI
class PayPalAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private PayPalAPI payPalAPI;

    public PayPalAdapter(PayPalAPI payPalAPI) {
        this.payPalAPI = payPalAPI;
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        payPalAPI.sendPayment(amount);
    }
}

// Adapter for StripeAPI
class StripeAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private StripeAPI stripeAPI;

    public StripeAdapter(StripeAPI stripeAPI) {
        this.stripeAPI = stripeAPI;
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        stripeAPI.makePayment(amount);
    }
}

// Client code
public class PaymentClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentProcessor payPalProcessor = new PayPalAdapter(new PayPalAPI());
        PaymentProcessor stripeProcessor = new StripeAdapter(new StripeAPI());

        payPalProcessor.processPayment(100.0);
        stripeProcessor.processPayment(200.0);
    }
}
```

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentProcessor {
        <<interface>>
        + processPayment(double amount)
    }
    class PayPalAPI {
        + sendPayment(double amount)
    }
    class StripeAPI {
        + makePayment(double amount)
    }
    class PayPalAdapter {
        - PayPalAPI payPalAPI
        + processPayment(double amount)
    }
    class StripeAdapter {
        - StripeAPI stripeAPI
        + processPayment(double amount)
    }
    PaymentProcessor <|.. PayPalAdapter
    PaymentProcessor <|.. StripeAdapter
    PayPalAdapter --> PayPalAPI
    StripeAdapter --> StripeAPI
```

### 3. Allowing Clients to Work with New Classes

In scenarios where new classes are introduced with interfaces that differ from existing ones, the Adapter Pattern can facilitate seamless integration without altering the client code.

**Why Use the Adapter Pattern?**

- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures new classes can be used without modifying existing client code.
- **Scalability**: Allows for the addition of new functionality with minimal disruption.
- **Code Isolation**: Keeps changes isolated to the adapter, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Existing interface
interface OldInterface {
    void oldMethod();
}

// New class with a different interface
class NewClass {
    void newMethod() {
        System.out.println("Executing new method");
    }
}

// Adapter to allow NewClass to be used as OldInterface
class NewClassAdapter implements OldInterface {
    private NewClass newClass;

    public NewClassAdapter(NewClass newClass) {
        this.newClass = newClass;
    }

    @Override
    public void oldMethod() {
        newClass.newMethod();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OldInterface oldInterface = new NewClassAdapter(new NewClass());
        oldInterface.oldMethod();
    }
}
```

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OldInterface {
        <<interface>>
        + oldMethod()
    }
    class NewClass {
        + newMethod()
    }
    class NewClassAdapter {
        - NewClass newClass
        + oldMethod()
    }
    OldInterface <|.. NewClassAdapter
    NewClassAdapter --> NewClass
```

### Benefits of Using the Adapter Pattern

- **Increased Flexibility**: The Adapter Pattern allows systems to interact with new or legacy components without significant changes to the existing codebase.
- **Code Reuse**: By enabling the integration of existing components, the Adapter Pattern encourages code reuse, reducing development time and effort.
- **Decoupling**: It helps decouple the client code from specific implementations, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
- **Ease of Integration**: The Adapter Pattern simplifies the integration of third-party libraries and APIs, making it easier to extend the functionality of an application.

### When to Consider the Adapter Pattern

- When you need to integrate a component with an incompatible interface into your system.
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
- When you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing each one.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Adapter Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Experiment with Different Adaptees**: Create additional adapters for other logging frameworks or payment APIs.
- **Modify the Target Interface**: Change the method signatures in the target interface and update the adapters accordingly.
- **Add New Functionality**: Extend the adapters to include additional methods or features.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

Let's visualize the Adapter Pattern in action using a sequence diagram to demonstrate how the client interacts with the adapter and adaptee:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Adapter
    participant Adaptee

    Client->>Adapter: request()
    Adapter->>Adaptee: specificRequest()
    Adaptee-->>Adapter: response
    Adapter-->>Client: response
```

**Diagram Description**: In this sequence diagram, the client makes a request to the adapter, which then translates the request into a format that the adaptee understands. The adaptee processes the request and returns a response to the adapter, which then forwards it to the client.
