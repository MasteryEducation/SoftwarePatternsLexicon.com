## 32.1 Glossary of Terms

This glossary serves as a comprehensive reference for key terms, acronyms, and phrases used throughout the guide. It is designed to assist experienced Java developers and software architects in understanding the concepts and techniques discussed in the context of Java design patterns and advanced programming practices. The glossary is organized alphabetically for ease of navigation.

### A

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is useful when a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created.

- **Adapter Pattern**: A structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

- **Aggregation**: A relationship where a child can exist independently of the parent. It represents a "has-a" relationship where the child can belong to multiple parents.

- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. In programming, it refers to a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task.

- **Annotation**: A form of metadata that provides data about a program but is not part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

### B

- **Builder Pattern**: A creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

- **Bridge Pattern**: A structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is used to separate the interface from the implementation.

- **Bytecode**: A form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. In Java, bytecode is the compiled format for Java programs.

### C

- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass the request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled. It decouples the sender of a request from its receiver.

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It defines a set of properties and methods that are common to all objects of one type.

- **Composite Pattern**: A structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **Concurrency**: The ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. In Java, concurrency is achieved through threads and the concurrent package.

- **Coupling**: The degree of interdependence between software modules. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design.

### D

- **Data Access Object (DAO)**: A pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. It separates the data persistence logic from the business logic.

- **Decorator Pattern**: A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

- **Dependency Injection**: A design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class in different ways.

- **Design Pattern**: A general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code but a template for how to solve a problem.

### E

- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data.

- **Entity**: An object that represents a single instance of a data model in a database. In Java, entities are often used in the context of JPA (Java Persistence API).

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: A software architecture pattern promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. It is used to build systems that are highly scalable and loosely coupled.

### F

- **Facade Pattern**: A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client from where the client can access the system.

- **Factory Method Pattern**: A creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Flyweight Pattern**: A structural design pattern that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It is used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.

### G

- **Garbage Collection**: The process of automatically freeing memory on the heap by deleting objects that are no longer reachable in the program. Java's garbage collector is responsible for this task.

- **Generics**: A feature of Java that allows the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for types. It provides type safety and eliminates the need for typecasting.

### H

- **HashMap**: A part of Java's collection framework that implements the Map interface. It is used to store key-value pairs and allows the retrieval of values based on keys.

- **Heuristic**: A problem-solving approach that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect but sufficient for reaching an immediate goal.

### I

- **Inheritance**: A mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows one class to inherit the fields and methods of another class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a subtype from a supertype.

- **Interface**: A reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields.

- **Iterator Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### J

- **JavaBeans**: A reusable software component for Java that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool. JavaBeans follow specific conventions, including having a no-argument constructor and allowing access to properties using getter and setter methods.

- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: An abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode.

### L

- **Lambda Expression**: A feature introduced in Java 8 that provides a clear and concise way to represent a single method interface using an expression. It is used primarily to define inline implementation of a functional interface.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: A principle in object-oriented programming that states objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### M

- **Mediator Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

- **Memento Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state. It is used to implement undo mechanisms.

- **Multithreading**: A feature of Java that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program to maximize the utilization of CPU. Threads are the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system.

### N

- **Null Object Pattern**: A design pattern that uses an object with defined neutral ("null") behavior. Instead of using a null reference to convey the absence of an object, a null object is used.

### O

- **Observer Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

- **Open/Closed Principle**: A principle in software engineering that states software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. It is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

### P

- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming.

- **Prototype Pattern**: A creational design pattern that allows cloning of objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes. It is used when the cost of creating a new instance of a class is more expensive than copying an existing instance.

- **Proxy Pattern**: A structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object. It acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking access to the real object.

### R

- **Refactoring**: The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. It improves nonfunctional attributes of the software.

- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

- **Responsibility**: In the context of design patterns, it refers to the obligation of a class or object to perform certain actions or provide certain services.

### S

- **Singleton Pattern**: A creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

- **SOLID Principles**: A set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They include the Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.

- **Strategy Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

- **Synchronization**: A mechanism that ensures that two or more concurrent processes or threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as a critical section.

### T

- **Template Method Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

- **Thread Safety**: A concept in Java that ensures that shared data structures are accessed by only one thread at a time, preventing data corruption.

### U

- **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**: A standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams, used to specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system.

### V

- **Value Object**: An object that contains attributes but has no conceptual identity. They should be immutable and are used to describe certain aspects of a domain.

### W

- **Wrapper Pattern**: A design pattern that allows additional functionality to be added to an existing class without modifying its structure. It is often used to adapt a class to a new interface.

### Y

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: A principle of extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until it is necessary. It is a practice to avoid over-engineering.

### Z

- **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: A concept in programming that suggests abstractions should not incur any runtime overhead. It is often used in the context of high-level programming languages that aim to be as efficient as low-level languages.
