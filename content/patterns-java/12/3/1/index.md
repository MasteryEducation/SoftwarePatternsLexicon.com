## 12.3.1 Getting Started with Project Reactor

### Introduction to Project Reactor

Project Reactor is a powerful library for building reactive applications in Java. It is part of the larger reactive programming ecosystem and provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating non-blocking, asynchronous applications. Reactor is particularly well-suited for applications that require high concurrency and low latency, making it a popular choice for modern web applications, microservices, and cloud-native architectures.

### Including Reactor in Your Java Project

To start using Project Reactor, you need to include it in your Java project. Reactor can be easily integrated using popular build tools like Maven and Gradle.

#### Using Maven

To include Reactor in a Maven project, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.12</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Using Gradle

For Gradle projects, add the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.4.12'
```

### Core Concepts: Flux and Mono

Reactor introduces two primary types for handling asynchronous sequences: `Flux` and `Mono`.

#### Flux

`Flux` represents a sequence of 0 to N items. It is ideal for scenarios where you expect multiple results, such as streaming data or handling collections.

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class FluxExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<String> stringFlux = Flux.just("Hello", "World", "from", "Reactor");
        stringFlux.subscribe(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

In this example, `Flux.just` creates a `Flux` that emits a sequence of strings. The `subscribe` method is used to consume the emitted items.

#### Mono

`Mono` represents a sequence of 0 to 1 item. It is suitable for operations that return a single result, such as fetching a single record from a database.

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public class MonoExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Mono<String> stringMono = Mono.just("Hello Mono");
        stringMono.subscribe(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

Here, `Mono.just` creates a `Mono` that emits a single string. Like `Flux`, the `subscribe` method is used to consume the item.

### Non-Blocking and Backpressure-Aware

One of the key features of Project Reactor is its non-blocking nature. Reactor's operators are designed to be non-blocking, allowing your application to handle more concurrent operations without being tied down by blocking calls.

#### Non-Blocking Example

Consider a scenario where you need to fetch data from multiple sources concurrently. With Reactor, you can achieve this without blocking the main thread:

```java
Flux<String> dataFlux = Flux.merge(
    fetchDataFromSourceA(),
    fetchDataFromSourceB(),
    fetchDataFromSourceC()
);

dataFlux.subscribe(data -> System.out.println("Received: " + data));
```

In this example, `Flux.merge` combines multiple `Flux` instances into a single `Flux`, allowing you to process data from multiple sources concurrently.

#### Backpressure

Backpressure is a mechanism to handle situations where the producer of data is faster than the consumer. Reactor provides built-in support for backpressure, ensuring that your application remains responsive even under heavy load.

```java
Flux.range(1, 100)
    .onBackpressureDrop()
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

In this example, `onBackpressureDrop` is used to drop items when the consumer cannot keep up with the producer, preventing memory overflow.

### Integration with Spring Projects

Reactor is tightly integrated with the Spring ecosystem, particularly with Spring WebFlux, which is a reactive web framework. This integration allows you to build fully reactive applications using familiar Spring concepts.

#### Spring WebFlux Example

Here's a simple example of a reactive REST controller using Spring WebFlux:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@RestController
public class ReactiveController {

    @GetMapping("/messages")
    public Flux<String> getMessages() {
        return Flux.just("Message 1", "Message 2", "Message 3");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `getMessages` method returns a `Flux` of strings, which are sent to the client as they are emitted.

### Historical Context and Evolution

Reactive programming has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, it was primarily used in specialized domains like telecommunications and finance. However, with the rise of cloud computing and microservices, the need for scalable, non-blocking applications has brought reactive programming into the mainstream.

Project Reactor, as part of the reactive programming movement, builds upon these principles and provides a robust framework for developing modern applications. Its integration with Spring and other Java technologies makes it a versatile tool for Java developers.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

Reactor is used in a variety of real-world scenarios, including:

- **Microservices**: Building scalable and resilient microservices that can handle high loads.
- **Web Applications**: Developing responsive web applications with real-time updates.
- **Data Processing**: Handling large streams of data efficiently, such as in IoT applications.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

While Reactor provides powerful tools for building reactive applications, there are common pitfalls to be aware of:

- **Blocking Calls**: Avoid using blocking calls within reactive pipelines, as they can negate the benefits of non-blocking execution.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle errors within your reactive streams to prevent unexpected application behavior.
- **Backpressure Management**: Ensure that your application can handle backpressure appropriately to avoid resource exhaustion.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

To reinforce your understanding of Project Reactor, try the following exercises:

1. **Create a Flux**: Write a program that creates a `Flux` from a list of integers and filters out even numbers.
2. **Handle Errors**: Modify the `Flux` to include error handling using `onErrorResume`.
3. **Combine Streams**: Create two `Flux` instances and combine them using `zip`.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

- **Project Reactor** is a powerful library for building non-blocking, reactive applications in Java.
- **Flux and Mono** are the core types for handling asynchronous sequences.
- **Non-blocking and backpressure-aware** features make Reactor suitable for high-concurrency applications.
