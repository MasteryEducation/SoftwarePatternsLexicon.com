- Understand the benefits of using design patterns in Java, including enhanced readability and reduced complexity.

### Principles of Object-Oriented Design

**Major Themes:**
- **SOLID Principles:** These five principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) form the foundation of robust object-oriented design.
- **DRY, KISS, and YAGNI:** These principles emphasize simplicity, avoiding redundancy, and implementing only necessary features.
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** Encourages using composition to achieve flexibility over inheritance.
- **Law of Demeter and GRASP Principles:** Focus on reducing coupling and assigning responsibilities effectively.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply SOLID principles to ensure your code is flexible and maintainable.
- Use DRY, KISS, and YAGNI to write efficient and straightforward code.
- Understand when to use composition instead of inheritance for better design.
- Implement GRASP principles to assign responsibilities clearly and effectively.

### Creational Patterns

**Major Themes:**
- **Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Object Pool, and Dependency Injection:** These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, ensuring that objects are created in a manner suitable to the situation.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Implement Singleton to ensure a class has only one instance.
- Use Factory Method and Abstract Factory to create objects without specifying the exact class.
- Apply Builder for constructing complex objects step-by-step.
- Utilize Prototype for creating new objects by copying existing ones.
- Manage resources efficiently with Object Pool.
- Enhance flexibility and testability with Dependency Injection.

**Code Example: Singleton Pattern**

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Structural Patterns

**Major Themes:**
- **Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy, Private Class Data, and Extension Object:** These patterns simplify relationships between entities and enhance the flexibility of your code.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Use Adapter to allow incompatible interfaces to work together.
- Apply Bridge to separate abstraction from implementation.
- Implement Composite to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- Use Decorator to add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- Simplify complex subsystems with Facade.
- Optimize memory usage with Flyweight.
- Control access to objects with Proxy.
- Protect data with Private Class Data.
- Add functionality dynamically with Extension Object.

**Code Example: Adapter Pattern**

```java
// Existing interface
interface OldInterface {
    void oldMethod();
}

// New interface
interface NewInterface {
    void newMethod();
}

// Adapter class
class Adapter implements NewInterface {
    private OldInterface oldObject;

    public Adapter(OldInterface oldObject) {
        this.oldObject = oldObject;
    }

    @Override
    public void newMethod() {
        oldObject.oldMethod();
    }
}
```

### Behavioral Patterns

**Major Themes:**
- **Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor, Specification, and Null Object:** These patterns manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Implement Chain of Responsibility to pass requests along a chain of handlers.
- Use Command to encapsulate requests as objects.
- Apply Interpreter for language interpretation.
- Use Iterator to traverse collections without exposing their underlying representation.
- Implement Mediator to reduce coupling between objects.
- Use Memento to capture and restore object states.
- Apply Observer for one-to-many dependency management.
- Use State to allow an object to alter its behavior when its state changes.
- Implement Strategy for interchangeable algorithms.
- Use Template Method to define the skeleton of an algorithm.
- Apply Visitor to perform operations on elements of an object structure.

**Code Example: Observer Pattern**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Subject interface
interface Subject {
    void registerObserver(Observer o);
    void removeObserver(Observer o);
    void notifyObservers();
}

// Observer interface
interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

// Concrete subject
class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String message;

    @Override
    public void registerObserver(Observer o) {
        observers.add(o);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer o) {
        observers.remove(o);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer o : observers) {
            o.update(message);
        }
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}

// Concrete observer
class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    private String name;

    public ConcreteObserver(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received message: " + message);
    }
}
```

### Concurrency Patterns

**Major Themes:**
- **Active Object, Balking, Double-Checked Locking, Read-Write Lock, Thread Pool, Future and Promise, Reactor, Proactor, and Scheduler:** These patterns address issues related to multi-threading and concurrency.

**Code Example: Thread Pool Pattern**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread("" + i);
            executor.execute(worker);
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        while (!executor.isTerminated()) {
        }
        System.out.println("Finished all threads");
    }
}

class WorkerThread implements Runnable {
    private String command;

    public WorkerThread(String s) {
        this.command = s;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " Start. Command = " + command);
        processCommand();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " End.");
    }

    private void processCommand() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Architectural Patterns

**Major Themes:**
- **Layered Architecture, MVC, MVP, MVVM, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, SOA, Hexagonal Architecture, Event Sourcing, and CQRS:** These patterns provide high-level structures for system organization.

**Learning Objectives:**

**Code Example: MVC Pattern**

```java
// Model
class Model {
    private String data;

    public String getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public void setData(String data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
}

// View
class View {
    public void display(String data) {
        System.out.println("Data: " + data);
    }
}

// Controller
class Controller {
    private Model model;
    private View view;

    public Controller(Model model, View view) {
        this.model = model;
        this.view = view;
    }

    public void setData(String data) {
        model.setData(data);
    }

    public void updateView() {
        view.display(model.getData());
    }
}
```

### Enterprise Design Patterns

**Code Example: DAO Pattern**

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

// DAO Interface
interface UserDAO {
    User getUserById(int id);
}

// DAO Implementation
class UserDAOImpl implements UserDAO {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
    private static final String USER = "root";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "password";

    @Override
    public User getUserById(int id) {
        User user = null;
        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD)) {
            String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
            PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
            preparedStatement.setInt(1, id);
            ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
            if (resultSet.next()) {
                user = new User(resultSet.getInt("id"), resultSet.getString("name"));
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return user;
    }
}

// User Class
class User {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public User(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```
