## 16.3 RESTful Services with Spring Boot

### Introduction to Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java applications, particularly RESTful web services. It simplifies the development process by providing a suite of tools and features that enable rapid application development. With its auto-configuration capabilities and starter dependencies, Spring Boot allows developers to focus on writing business logic rather than boilerplate code.

Spring Boot's advantages include:

- **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures your application based on the dependencies present in the classpath.
- **Starter Dependencies**: Simplifies dependency management by providing a set of pre-configured dependencies for common use cases.
- **Embedded Servers**: Allows running applications without the need for an external server, using embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
- **Production-Ready Features**: Includes metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration for production environments.

For more information, visit the [Spring Boot official page](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

### Creating RESTful Endpoints with Spring Boot

RESTful web services are based on the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), which is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful services use HTTP methods explicitly and are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request.

#### Setting Up a Spring Boot Project

To start building RESTful services with Spring Boot, you need to set up a Spring Boot project. You can use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a project with the necessary dependencies.

1. **Select Project Metadata**: Choose Maven or Gradle as the build tool, and specify the Group, Artifact, and Name for your project.
2. **Add Dependencies**: Include `Spring Web` for building web applications and RESTful services.
3. **Generate the Project**: Download the generated project and import it into your IDE.

#### Creating a REST Controller

A REST controller in Spring Boot is a class annotated with `@RestController`, which combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. This annotation indicates that the class handles HTTP requests and returns data directly as the response body.

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        // Retrieve and return all users
    }

    @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Retrieve and return user by ID
    }

    @PostMapping("/users")
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Create and return a new user
    }

    @PutMapping("/users/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
        // Update and return the user
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/users/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Delete the user
    }
}
```

- **`@GetMapping`**: Maps HTTP GET requests to the specified method.
- **`@PostMapping`**: Maps HTTP POST requests.
- **`@PutMapping`**: Maps HTTP PUT requests.
- **`@DeleteMapping`**: Maps HTTP DELETE requests.
- **`@RequestMapping`**: Specifies the base URL for all endpoints in the controller.
- **`@PathVariable`**: Binds a method parameter to a URI template variable.
- **`@RequestBody`**: Binds the HTTP request body to a method parameter.

#### Content Negotiation

Spring Boot supports content negotiation, allowing your RESTful services to produce different media types, such as JSON or XML. By default, Spring Boot uses Jackson to convert Java objects to JSON.

To produce XML responses, you can add the `jackson-dataformat-xml` dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

You can specify the media type using the `produces` attribute in the mapping annotations:

```java
@GetMapping(value = "/users", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public List<User> getAllUsers() {
    // Return users as JSON
}

@GetMapping(value = "/users", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)
public List<User> getAllUsersAsXml() {
    // Return users as XML
}
```

### Exception Handling and Validation

#### Exception Handling

Handling exceptions in RESTful services is crucial for providing meaningful error messages to clients. Spring Boot provides a convenient way to handle exceptions using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`.

```java
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    public ErrorResponse handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return new ErrorResponse("Resource not found", ex.getMessage());
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
    public ErrorResponse handleGenericException(Exception ex) {
        return new ErrorResponse("Internal server error", ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

- **`@ControllerAdvice`**: Allows you to handle exceptions globally across all controllers.
- **`@ExceptionHandler`**: Specifies the exception type to handle and the method to execute when the exception occurs.
- **`@ResponseStatus`**: Sets the HTTP status code for the response.

#### Validation

Spring Boot supports validation using the `javax.validation` package. You can use annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, and `@Email` to validate request data.

```java
import javax.validation.constraints.*;

public class User {

    @NotNull
    private Long id;

    @Size(min = 2, max = 30)
    private String name;

    @Email
    private String email;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

To enable validation, annotate the method parameter with `@Valid`:

```java
@PostMapping("/users")
public User createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {
    // Create and return a new user
}
```

### API Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

Swagger, now known as OpenAPI, is a tool for documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing APIs.

To integrate Swagger with Spring Boot, add the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-ui</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.10</version>
</dependency>
```

Once added, you can access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

For more information, visit the [Swagger official page](https://swagger.io/).

### Best Practices for Designing RESTful APIs

1. **Statelessness**: Ensure that each request from the client contains all the information needed to process the request.
2. **Resource Naming**: Use nouns for resource names and avoid verbs. For example, use `/users` instead of `/getUsers`.
3. **Versioning**: Use versioning to manage changes in your API. You can include the version in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/users`) or in the request header.
4. **HTTP Methods**: Use HTTP methods appropriately (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for deletion).
5. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages and use appropriate HTTP status codes.
6. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for endpoints that return large datasets to improve performance.

### Testing RESTful Services

#### Using Postman

Postman is a popular tool for testing RESTful services. It allows you to send HTTP requests and view responses, making it easy to test and debug your APIs.

#### Unit Testing with MockMvc

Spring Boot provides the `MockMvc` class for testing RESTful services. It allows you to perform requests and verify responses without starting the server.

```java
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.*;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.*;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class UserControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Test
    public void shouldReturnAllUsers() throws Exception {
        mockMvc.perform(get("/api/users"))
               .andExpect(status().isOk())
               .andExpect(content().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
               .andExpect(jsonPath("$", hasSize(2)));
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

Building RESTful services with Spring Boot is a powerful way to create scalable and maintainable web applications. By leveraging Spring Boot's features, such as auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and embedded servers, developers can focus on writing business logic and delivering value to users. Additionally, following best practices for API design and testing ensures that your services are robust and reliable.
