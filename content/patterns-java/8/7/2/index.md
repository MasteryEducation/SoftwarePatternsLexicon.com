## 8.7.2 Originator, Memento, and Caretaker Roles

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where undo or rollback operations are required. The Memento Pattern is composed of three primary roles: the **Originator**, the **Memento**, and the **Caretaker**. Understanding these roles and their interactions is crucial for implementing the pattern effectively in Java applications.

### Originator

#### Description

The **Originator** is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It is responsible for creating a Memento containing a snapshot of its current state and using the Memento to restore its state when needed.

#### Responsibilities

- **Create Memento**: The Originator creates a Memento object that captures its current state.
- **Restore State**: The Originator uses a Memento to restore its state to a previous point in time.
- **Manage State**: The Originator manages its internal state and provides methods to modify it.

#### Example

Consider a text editor application where the Originator is a `TextEditor` class. The `TextEditor` can save its current text content and restore it later.

```java
public class TextEditor {
    private String content;

    // Sets the content of the text editor
    public void setContent(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    // Returns the current content
    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }

    // Creates a Memento object containing the current state
    public TextEditorMemento save() {
        return new TextEditorMemento(content);
    }

    // Restores the state from a Memento object
    public void restore(TextEditorMemento memento) {
        this.content = memento.getContent();
    }
}
```

### Memento

#### Description

The **Memento** is an object that stores the state of the Originator. It is a simple data structure with no methods that modify its state. The Memento provides a way to capture and externalize an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.

#### Responsibilities

- **Store State**: The Memento stores the state of the Originator.
- **Provide Access**: The Memento provides access to the stored state for the Originator.

#### Example

In the text editor example, the `TextEditorMemento` class acts as the Memento, storing the content of the text editor.

```java
public class TextEditorMemento {
    private final String content;

    // Constructor to initialize the Memento with the current state
    public TextEditorMemento(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    // Returns the stored content
    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
```

### Caretaker

#### Description

The **Caretaker** is responsible for managing the Memento's lifecycle. It requests the Originator to save its state and stores the Memento. The Caretaker does not modify or inspect the contents of the Memento.

#### Responsibilities

- **Request Save**: The Caretaker requests the Originator to save its state.
- **Store Memento**: The Caretaker stores the Memento for future restoration.
- **Request Restore**: The Caretaker requests the Originator to restore its state from a Memento.

#### Example

In the text editor example, the `EditorHistory` class acts as the Caretaker, managing the history of Mementos.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class EditorHistory {
    private final Stack<TextEditorMemento> history = new Stack<>();

    // Saves the current state to the history
    public void save(TextEditor textEditor) {
        history.push(textEditor.save());
    }

    // Restores the last saved state
    public void undo(TextEditor textEditor) {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            textEditor.restore(history.pop());
        }
    }
}
```

### Interactions Between Roles

The interactions between the Originator, Memento, and Caretaker are crucial for the Memento Pattern's functionality. The Caretaker requests the Originator to save its state, which results in the creation of a Memento. The Caretaker then stores this Memento. When a restore operation is needed, the Caretaker provides the Memento back to the Originator, which uses it to restore its state.

```java
public class MementoPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor();
        EditorHistory history = new EditorHistory();

        textEditor.setContent("Version 1");
        history.save(textEditor);

        textEditor.setContent("Version 2");
        history.save(textEditor);

        textEditor.setContent("Version 3");
        System.out.println("Current Content: " + textEditor.getContent());

        history.undo(textEditor);
        System.out.println("After Undo: " + textEditor.getContent());

        history.undo(textEditor);
        System.out.println("After Second Undo: " + textEditor.getContent());
    }
}
```

### Considerations for Memory Management and State Size

When implementing the Memento Pattern, it is essential to consider the memory implications of storing multiple Mementos, especially if the state size is large or if the application frequently saves states.

#### Memory Management

- **Limit History Size**: Implement a mechanism to limit the number of Mementos stored, such as a fixed-size history or a time-based expiration.
- **Efficient Storage**: Use efficient data structures to store Mementos, especially if the state is large or complex.

#### State Size

- **Selective State Saving**: Only save the necessary parts of the state to reduce memory usage.
- **Compression**: Consider compressing the state data if it is large and can be compressed effectively.

### Historical Context and Evolution

The Memento Pattern was introduced as part of the "Gang of Four" design patterns in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. The pattern has evolved with modern programming languages, including Java, to incorporate advanced features such as serialization and lambda expressions for more efficient state management.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

The Memento Pattern is widely used in applications requiring undo functionality, such as text editors, graphic design software, and games. It is also applicable in scenarios where state rollback is necessary, such as transaction management in databases.

### Expert Tips and Best Practices

- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that the Memento does not expose the internal state of the Originator to the Caretaker.
- **Immutable Mementos**: Consider making Mementos immutable to prevent accidental modifications.
- **State Validation**: Implement validation logic in the Originator to ensure that restored states are valid.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Excessive Memory Usage**: Avoid storing too many Mementos by implementing a strategy to manage the history size.
- **Complex State Management**: Simplify state management by breaking down complex states into smaller, manageable components.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Implement a Memento Pattern**: Create a simple drawing application that allows users to draw shapes and undo their actions using the Memento Pattern.
2. **Optimize Memory Usage**: Modify the text editor example to limit the number of Mementos stored to a maximum of five.
3. **State Compression**: Implement a compression mechanism for the Memento in the text editor example to reduce memory usage.

### Key Takeaways

- The Memento Pattern provides a way to capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation.
- The Originator, Memento, and Caretaker roles are essential for implementing the pattern effectively.
- Consider memory management and state size when implementing the Memento Pattern in Java applications.
