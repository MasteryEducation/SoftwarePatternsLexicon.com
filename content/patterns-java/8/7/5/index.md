## 8.7.5 Use Cases and Examples

The Memento Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that provides a way to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo/redo functionality, manage transactions with rollback capabilities, or maintain state encapsulation and modularity in complex systems. In this section, we will explore several real-world use cases and examples of the Memento Pattern in Java, highlighting its benefits and addressing potential challenges.

### Use Case 1: Undo/Redo Functionality in Text Editors

One of the most common applications of the Memento Pattern is in implementing undo/redo functionality in text editors. This functionality allows users to revert changes or reapply them, enhancing user experience and productivity.

#### Implementation

Consider a simple text editor where users can type text, delete it, and undo or redo their actions. The Memento Pattern can be used to capture the state of the text at various points in time, allowing the editor to restore previous states as needed.

```java
// Memento class to store the state of the text
class TextMemento {
    private final String text;

    public TextMemento(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text;
    }
}

// Originator class that creates and restores mementos
class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

    public void type(String newText) {
        text.append(newText);
    }

    public TextMemento save() {
        return new TextMemento(text.toString());
    }

    public void restore(TextMemento memento) {
        text = new StringBuilder(memento.getText());
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text.toString();
    }
}

// Caretaker class that manages mementos
class TextEditorHistory {
    private final Stack<TextMemento> history = new Stack<>();

    public void save(TextEditor editor) {
        history.push(editor.save());
    }

    public void undo(TextEditor editor) {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            editor.restore(history.pop());
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
public class MementoExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor editor = new TextEditor();
        TextEditorHistory history = new TextEditorHistory();

        editor.type("Hello, ");
        history.save(editor);

        editor.type("World!");
        history.save(editor);

        System.out.println("Current Text: " + editor.getText());

        history.undo(editor);
        System.out.println("After Undo: " + editor.getText());

        history.undo(editor);
        System.out.println("After Undo: " + editor.getText());
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

- **TextMemento**: Stores the state of the text.
- **TextEditor**: Originator that creates and restores mementos.
- **TextEditorHistory**: Caretaker that manages the history of mementos.

This implementation allows the text editor to save its state at various points and restore those states, effectively implementing undo functionality.

#### Benefits

- **State Encapsulation**: The internal state of the text editor is encapsulated within the memento, maintaining encapsulation.
- **Modularity**: The separation of concerns between the editor, memento, and history enhances modularity.

#### Challenges

- **Performance**: Storing large states frequently can impact performance and memory usage.
- **Security**: Care must be taken to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed through mementos.

### Use Case 2: Transaction Management with Rollback

In transaction management, the Memento Pattern can be used to implement rollback functionality, allowing systems to revert to a previous state in case of errors or failures.

#### Implementation

Consider a banking system where transactions can be performed on accounts. The Memento Pattern can be used to save the state of an account before a transaction, allowing the system to rollback if necessary.

```java
// Memento class to store the state of an account
class AccountMemento {
    private final double balance;

    public AccountMemento(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

// Originator class that creates and restores mementos
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }

    public AccountMemento save() {
        return new AccountMemento(balance);
    }

    public void restore(AccountMemento memento) {
        balance = memento.getBalance();
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

// Caretaker class that manages mementos
class TransactionManager {
    private final Stack<AccountMemento> history = new Stack<>();

    public void save(BankAccount account) {
        history.push(account.save());
    }

    public void rollback(BankAccount account) {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            account.restore(history.pop());
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
public class TransactionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);
        TransactionManager manager = new TransactionManager();

        manager.save(account);
        account.deposit(500);
        System.out.println("Balance after deposit: " + account.getBalance());

        manager.save(account);
        account.withdraw(200);
        System.out.println("Balance after withdrawal: " + account.getBalance());

        manager.rollback(account);
        System.out.println("Balance after rollback: " + account.getBalance());

        manager.rollback(account);
        System.out.println("Balance after rollback: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

- **AccountMemento**: Stores the state of the account balance.
- **BankAccount**: Originator that creates and restores mementos.
- **TransactionManager**: Caretaker that manages the history of mementos.

This implementation allows the banking system to save the state of an account before transactions and rollback if needed, ensuring data integrity.

```java
// Memento class to store the state of the game
class GameStateMemento {
    private final int level;
    private final int score;

    public GameStateMemento(int level, int score) {
        this.level = level;
        this.score = score;
    }

    public int getLevel() {
        return level;
    }

    public int getScore() {
        return score;
    }
}

// Originator class that creates and restores mementos
class Game {
    private int level;
    private int score;

    public void play(int newLevel, int newScore) {
        level = newLevel;
        score = newScore;
    }

    public GameStateMemento save() {
        return new GameStateMemento(level, score);
    }

    public void restore(GameStateMemento memento) {
        level = memento.getLevel();
        score = memento.getScore();
    }

    public void displayState() {
        System.out.println("Level: " + level + ", Score: " + score);
    }
}

// Caretaker class that manages mementos
class GameSaveManager {
    private final Stack<GameStateMemento> saves = new Stack<>();

    public void save(Game game) {
        saves.push(game.save());
    }

    public void load(Game game) {
        if (!saves.isEmpty()) {
            game.restore(saves.pop());
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
public class GameExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Game();
        GameSaveManager saveManager = new GameSaveManager();

        game.play(1, 100);
        saveManager.save(game);

        game.play(2, 200);
        saveManager.save(game);

        game.displayState();

        saveManager.load(game);
        game.displayState();

        saveManager.load(game);
        game.displayState();
    }
}
```
