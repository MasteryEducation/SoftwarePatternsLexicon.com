## 8.7.3 Handling State Restoration

In the realm of software design, the ability to restore an object's state is crucial for implementing features such as undo/redo functionality, state checkpoints, and versioning. The Memento Pattern, a behavioral design pattern, provides a robust framework for capturing and restoring an object's state without violating encapsulation. This section delves into advanced techniques for handling state restoration using the Memento Pattern in Java, focusing on managing multiple mementos, optimizing performance through partial state saving, and maintaining encapsulation.

### Managing Multiple Mementos for Undo/Redo Functionality

The Memento Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo/redo functionality. This requires managing a sequence of mementos that represent different states of an object over time. To achieve this, consider the following strategies:

#### Implementing a Stack-Based Approach

A common approach to managing multiple mementos is to use two stacks: one for undo operations and another for redo operations. Each time a change is made to the object's state, a new memento is created and pushed onto the undo stack. When an undo operation is performed, the current state is saved to the redo stack, and the last state from the undo stack is restored.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

// Originator class
class TextEditor {
    private String content;

    public void setContent(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }

    public Memento save() {
        return new Memento(content);
    }

    public void restore(Memento memento) {
        content = memento.getContent();
    }

    // Memento class
    static class Memento {
        private final String content;

        private Memento(String content) {
            this.content = content;
        }

        private String getContent() {
            return content;
        }
    }
}

// Caretaker class
class EditorHistory {
    private Stack<TextEditor.Memento> undoStack = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<TextEditor.Memento> redoStack = new Stack<>();

    public void saveState(TextEditor editor) {
        undoStack.push(editor.save());
        redoStack.clear();
    }

    public void undo(TextEditor editor) {
        if (!undoStack.isEmpty()) {
            redoStack.push(editor.save());
            editor.restore(undoStack.pop());
        }
    }

    public void redo(TextEditor editor) {
        if (!redoStack.isEmpty()) {
            undoStack.push(editor.save());
            editor.restore(redoStack.pop());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the `TextEditor` class acts as the Originator, and the `EditorHistory` class serves as the Caretaker. The `EditorHistory` maintains two stacks to manage undo and redo operations. This approach ensures that state transitions are reversible and encapsulated.

#### Handling State Transitions

When implementing undo/redo functionality, consider the following best practices:

- **Limit Stack Size**: To prevent memory overflow, limit the size of the undo and redo stacks. This can be achieved by removing the oldest memento when the stack exceeds a certain size.
- **State Comparison**: Before saving a new memento, compare the current state with the last saved state to avoid unnecessary memento creation.
- **Concurrency Considerations**: Ensure thread safety when managing mementos in a multi-threaded environment. Use synchronization mechanisms or concurrent data structures to handle concurrent access to the stacks.

### Optimizing Performance with Partial State Saving

In some cases, saving the entire state of an object can be resource-intensive, especially for large objects or complex systems. Partial state saving can optimize performance by capturing only the necessary attributes. Here are strategies to achieve this:

#### Selective Attribute Saving

Identify which attributes are essential for restoration and include only those in the memento. This approach reduces memory usage and improves performance.

```java
class GameCharacter {
    private int health;
    private int mana;
    private String position;
    private String inventory; // Assume this is a large object

    public Memento save() {
        // Save only health and position
        return new Memento(health, position);
    }

    public void restore(Memento memento) {
        this.health = memento.getHealth();
        this.position = memento.getPosition();
    }

    static class Memento {
        private final int health;
        private final String position;

        private Memento(int health, String position) {
            this.health = health;
            this.position = position;
        }

        private int getHealth() {
            return health;
        }

        private String getPosition() {
            return position;
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the `GameCharacter` class saves only the `health` and `position` attributes, ignoring the `inventory` to optimize performance. This approach is suitable when only certain attributes are critical for restoration.

#### Incremental State Saving

For objects with frequently changing states, consider incremental state saving, where only changes since the last memento are recorded. This technique is akin to delta encoding and can significantly reduce the size of mementos.

### Maintaining Encapsulation During Restoration

One of the key benefits of the Memento Pattern is its ability to preserve encapsulation. The Originator class should expose only the necessary methods to create and restore mementos, keeping the internal state hidden from the Caretaker.

#### Encapsulation Best Practices

- **Private Memento Class**: Define the Memento class as a private inner class within the Originator. This restricts access to the memento's state and ensures that only the Originator can modify it.
- **Immutable Mementos**: Make mementos immutable by providing only getter methods and initializing all attributes in the constructor. This prevents accidental modification of the saved state.
- **Controlled Access**: Provide controlled access to memento creation and restoration methods, ensuring that only authorized components can manipulate the state.

### Real-World Scenarios and Applications

The Memento Pattern is widely used in applications requiring state management and restoration. Here are some real-world scenarios:

- **Text Editors**: Implementing undo/redo functionality in text editors, where each keystroke or formatting change can be reversed.
- **Game Development**: Saving and restoring game states, allowing players to revert to previous checkpoints.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Managing state transitions in data processing pipelines, enabling rollback to previous stages in case of errors.

### Conclusion

Handling state restoration using the Memento Pattern in Java involves managing multiple mementos, optimizing performance through partial state saving, and maintaining encapsulation. By implementing these techniques, developers can create robust and efficient applications that support complex state management requirements.

### Key Takeaways
