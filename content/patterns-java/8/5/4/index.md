## 8.5.4 Enhancing Iterators

Iterators are a fundamental component of the Java Collections Framework, providing a standard way to traverse collections. However, the basic iterator interface in Java is limited to forward-only traversal. Enhancing iterators involves extending their capabilities to support more complex iteration scenarios, such as bidirectional iteration, filtering, and transformation. This section explores these enhancements, providing practical examples and discussing their implications on performance and resource utilization.

### Bidirectional Iteration

Bidirectional iteration allows traversing a collection in both forward and backward directions. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to revisit elements or navigate through a collection dynamically.

#### Implementing Bidirectional Iteration

Java provides the `ListIterator` interface, which extends the basic `Iterator` interface to support bidirectional iteration. The `ListIterator` interface includes methods such as `previous()`, `hasPrevious()`, `nextIndex()`, and `previousIndex()`, enabling backward traversal.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ListIterator;

public class BidirectionalIteratorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("A");
        list.add("B");
        list.add("C");

        ListIterator<String> iterator = list.listIterator();

        System.out.println("Forward iteration:");
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }

        System.out.println("Backward iteration:");
        while (iterator.hasPrevious()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.previous());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ListIterator` is used to traverse the list both forward and backward. This flexibility is essential in applications such as text editors, where users may navigate through text in both directions.

#### Performance Considerations

Bidirectional iteration can impact performance, especially in large collections. The `ListIterator` maintains an internal cursor, and operations like `previous()` may require additional computational overhead compared to forward-only iteration. It's crucial to consider these factors when designing systems that require bidirectional traversal.

### Filtering and Transformation

Enhancing iterators with filtering and transformation capabilities allows for more expressive and concise code. These enhancements enable iterators to selectively process elements or transform them during iteration.

#### Adding Filtering Capabilities

Filtering involves iterating over a collection and selecting elements that meet specific criteria. This can be achieved by extending the iterator to include a filtering mechanism.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class FilteringIterator<T> implements Iterator<T> {
    private final Iterator<T> iterator;
    private final Predicate<T> predicate;
    private T nextElement;
    private boolean hasNextElement;

    public FilteringIterator(Iterator<T> iterator, Predicate<T> predicate) {
        this.iterator = iterator;
        this.predicate = predicate;
        advance();
    }

    private void advance() {
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            T element = iterator.next();
            if (predicate.test(element)) {
                nextElement = element;
                hasNextElement = true;
                return;
            }
        }
        hasNextElement = false;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return hasNextElement;
    }

    @Override
    public T next() {
        if (!hasNextElement) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No more elements");
        }
        T result = nextElement;
        advance();
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(1);
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(4);

        Iterator<Integer> iterator = new FilteringIterator<>(numbers.iterator(), n -> n % 2 == 0);

        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `FilteringIterator` uses a `Predicate` to filter elements. Only elements that satisfy the predicate are returned during iteration. This approach is useful for scenarios where you need to process only a subset of elements, such as filtering out invalid data.

#### Transformation Capabilities

Transformation involves applying a function to each element during iteration, modifying the elements as they are traversed. This can be achieved by extending the iterator to include a transformation mechanism.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Function;

public class TransformingIterator<T, R> implements Iterator<R> {
    private final Iterator<T> iterator;
    private final Function<T, R> transformer;

    public TransformingIterator(Iterator<T> iterator, Function<T, R> transformer) {
        this.iterator = iterator;
        this.transformer = transformer;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return iterator.hasNext();
    }

    @Override
    public R next() {
        return transformer.apply(iterator.next());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
        strings.add("hello");
        strings.add("world");

        Iterator<String> iterator = new TransformingIterator<>(strings.iterator(), String::toUpperCase);

        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TransformingIterator` applies a transformation function to each element, converting strings to uppercase. This approach is beneficial for scenarios where you need to modify elements on-the-fly, such as formatting data for display.

#### Combining Filtering and Transformation

Combining filtering and transformation capabilities can lead to powerful and flexible iteration constructs. By chaining these enhancements, you can create complex data processing pipelines.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class FilterTransformIterator<T, R> implements Iterator<R> {
    private final Iterator<T> iterator;
    private final Predicate<T> predicate;
    private final Function<T, R> transformer;
    private T nextElement;
    private boolean hasNextElement;

    public FilterTransformIterator(Iterator<T> iterator, Predicate<T> predicate, Function<T, R> transformer) {
        this.iterator = iterator;
        this.predicate = predicate;
        this.transformer = transformer;
        advance();
    }

    private void advance() {
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            T element = iterator.next();
            if (predicate.test(element)) {
                nextElement = element;
                hasNextElement = true;
                return;
            }
        }
        hasNextElement = false;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return hasNextElement;
    }

    @Override
    public R next() {
        if (!hasNextElement) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No more elements");
        }
        R result = transformer.apply(nextElement);
        advance();
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(1);
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(4);

        Iterator<String> iterator = new FilterTransformIterator<>(
                numbers.iterator(),
                n -> n % 2 == 0,
                n -> "Number: " + n
        );

        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates a `FilterTransformIterator` that combines filtering and transformation. It filters even numbers and transforms them into formatted strings. This combination is useful for scenarios like data cleaning and transformation in data processing pipelines.

### Advanced Iteration with Streams and Generators

Java 8 introduced the Streams API, which provides a high-level abstraction for processing sequences of elements. Streams support operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, making them a powerful tool for advanced iteration scenarios.

#### Using Streams for Enhanced Iteration

Streams allow for concise and expressive iteration, with built-in support for filtering and transformation. They also provide parallel processing capabilities, which can improve performance in certain scenarios.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three", "four");

        strings.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.length() > 3)
                .map(String::toUpperCase)
                .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

In this example, a stream is used to filter strings with more than three characters and transform them to uppercase. The `forEach` method is then used to print the results. Streams provide a declarative approach to iteration, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability.

#### Generator Functions

Generator functions are a concept from other programming languages that can be emulated in Java using iterators. They allow for lazy evaluation, generating elements on-the-fly as needed.

```java
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

public class GeneratorIterator<T> implements Iterator<T> {
    private final Supplier<T> generator;
    private boolean hasNext;

    public GeneratorIterator(Supplier<T> generator) {
        this.generator = generator;
        this.hasNext = true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return hasNext;
    }

    @Override
    public T next() {
        T value = generator.get();
        if (value == null) {
            hasNext = false;
        }
        return value;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Iterator<Integer> iterator = new GeneratorIterator<>(new FibonacciSupplier());

        for (int i = 0; i < 10 && iterator.hasNext(); i++) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}

class FibonacciSupplier implements Supplier<Integer> {
    private int prev = 0;
    private int curr = 1;

    @Override
    public Integer get() {
        int next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
        return next;
    }
}
```

In this example, a `GeneratorIterator` is used to generate Fibonacci numbers on-the-fly. The `FibonacciSupplier` provides the logic for generating the sequence. This approach is useful for scenarios where you need to generate large or infinite sequences without precomputing all elements.
