## 8.11.4 Use Cases and Examples

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. In this section, we will delve into practical applications of the Template Method pattern, exploring its use in various domains such as game development, report generation, and data processing pipelines. We will also discuss its role in enforcing policy and standardization, along with potential issues like rigidity and subclass proliferation.

### Implementing Algorithms with Varying Steps

One of the primary use cases of the Template Method pattern is in implementing algorithms that have a fixed sequence of steps, but where some of these steps can vary. This is particularly useful in scenarios like game loops or report generation.

#### Game Development

In game development, the game loop is a critical component that manages the flow of the game. The Template Method pattern can be used to define the structure of the game loop, allowing different games to implement specific behaviors for certain steps.

```java
abstract class Game {
    // Template method
    public final void play() {
        initialize();
        startPlay();
        endPlay();
    }

    abstract void initialize();
    abstract void startPlay();
    abstract void endPlay();
}

class Chess extends Game {
    @Override
    void initialize() {
        System.out.println("Chess Game Initialized! Start playing.");
    }

    @Override
    void startPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Started. Welcome to Chess.");
    }

    @Override
    void endPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Finished!");
    }
}

class Soccer extends Game {
    @Override
    void initialize() {
        System.out.println("Soccer Game Initialized! Start playing.");
    }

    @Override
    void startPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Started. Welcome to Soccer.");
    }

    @Override
    void endPlay() {
        System.out.println("Game Finished!");
    }
}

// Client code
public class TemplateMethodPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Chess();
        game.play();
        System.out.println();
        game = new Soccer();
        game.play();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Game` class defines the template method `play()`, which outlines the steps of the game loop. The `Chess` and `Soccer` classes provide specific implementations for these steps.

#### Report Generation

Report generation often involves a series of steps such as data retrieval, data processing, and report formatting. The Template Method pattern can be used to define the overall structure of the report generation process, while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps.

```java
abstract class ReportGenerator {
    // Template method
    public final void generateReport() {
        fetchData();
        processData();
        formatReport();
    }

    abstract void fetchData();
    abstract void processData();
    abstract void formatReport();
}

class PDFReportGenerator extends ReportGenerator {
    @Override
    void fetchData() {
        System.out.println("Fetching data for PDF report.");
    }

    @Override
    void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing data for PDF report.");
    }

    @Override
    void formatReport() {
        System.out.println("Formatting PDF report.");
    }
}

class HTMLReportGenerator extends ReportGenerator {
    @Override
    void fetchData() {
        System.out.println("Fetching data for HTML report.");
    }

    @Override
    void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing data for HTML report.");
    }

    @Override
    void formatReport() {
        System.out.println("Formatting HTML report.");
    }
}

// Client code
public class ReportGeneratorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReportGenerator pdfReport = new PDFReportGenerator();
        pdfReport.generateReport();
        System.out.println();
        ReportGenerator htmlReport = new HTMLReportGenerator();
        htmlReport.generateReport();
    }
}
```

In this scenario, the `ReportGenerator` class defines the template method `generateReport()`, which outlines the steps for generating a report. The `PDFReportGenerator` and `HTMLReportGenerator` classes provide specific implementations for these steps.

### Data Processing Pipelines

Data processing pipelines often involve a series of steps such as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). The Template Method pattern can be used to define the structure of the pipeline, allowing different implementations for specific steps.

```java
abstract class DataPipeline {
    // Template method
    public final void executePipeline() {
        extractData();
        transformData();
        loadData();
    }

    abstract void extractData();
    abstract void transformData();
    abstract void loadData();
}

class CSVDataPipeline extends DataPipeline {
    @Override
    void extractData() {
        System.out.println("Extracting data from CSV file.");
    }

    @Override
    void transformData() {
        System.out.println("Transforming CSV data.");
    }

    @Override
    void loadData() {
        System.out.println("Loading data into database.");
    }
}

class JSONDataPipeline extends DataPipeline {
    @Override
    void extractData() {
        System.out.println("Extracting data from JSON file.");
    }

    @Override
    void transformData() {
        System.out.println("Transforming JSON data.");
    }

    @Override
    void loadData() {
        System.out.println("Loading data into database.");
    }
}

// Client code
public class DataPipelineDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataPipeline csvPipeline = new CSVDataPipeline();
        csvPipeline.executePipeline();
        System.out.println();
        DataPipeline jsonPipeline = new JSONDataPipeline();
        jsonPipeline.executePipeline();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `DataPipeline` class defines the template method `executePipeline()`, which outlines the steps for processing data. The `CSVDataPipeline` and `JSONDataPipeline` classes provide specific implementations for these steps.

### Enforcing Policy and Standardization

The Template Method pattern is also useful for enforcing policy and standardization across different implementations. By defining a template method, you can ensure that certain steps are always executed in a specific order, promoting consistency and adherence to best practices.

#### Example: Document Approval Process

Consider a document approval process where certain steps must always be followed, such as review, approval, and archiving. The Template Method pattern can enforce this process, while allowing customization of specific steps.

```java
abstract class DocumentApproval {
    // Template method
    public final void approveDocument() {
        reviewDocument();
        approve();
        archiveDocument();
    }

    abstract void reviewDocument();
    abstract void approve();
    abstract void archiveDocument();
}

class LegalDocumentApproval extends DocumentApproval {
    @Override
    void reviewDocument() {
        System.out.println("Reviewing legal document.");
    }

    @Override
    void approve() {
        System.out.println("Approving legal document.");
    }

    @Override
    void archiveDocument() {
        System.out.println("Archiving legal document.");
    }
}

class FinancialDocumentApproval extends DocumentApproval {
    @Override
    void reviewDocument() {
        System.out.println("Reviewing financial document.");
    }

    @Override
    void approve() {
        System.out.println("Approving financial document.");
    }

    @Override
    void archiveDocument() {
        System.out.println("Archiving financial document.");
    }
}

// Client code
public class DocumentApprovalDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DocumentApproval legalApproval = new LegalDocumentApproval();
        legalApproval.approveDocument();
        System.out.println();
        DocumentApproval financialApproval = new FinancialDocumentApproval();
        financialApproval.approveDocument();
    }
}
```

In this scenario, the `DocumentApproval` class defines the template method `approveDocument()`, which outlines the steps for approving a document. The `LegalDocumentApproval` and `FinancialDocumentApproval` classes provide specific implementations for these steps.

### Potential Issues

While the Template Method pattern offers numerous benefits, it also has potential drawbacks that developers should be aware of.

#### Rigidity

The Template Method pattern can introduce rigidity into the codebase, as the algorithm's structure is fixed in the superclass. This can make it difficult to modify the algorithm's sequence of steps without altering the superclass, potentially affecting all subclasses.

#### Subclass Proliferation

The pattern can lead to subclass proliferation, as each variation of the algorithm requires a new subclass. This can result in a large number of subclasses, making the codebase more complex and harder to maintain.

### Conclusion

The Template Method pattern is a powerful tool for defining the structure of an algorithm while allowing customization of specific steps. It is particularly useful in scenarios such as game development, report generation, and data processing pipelines. By enforcing policy and standardization, the pattern promotes consistency and adherence to best practices. However, developers should be mindful of potential issues such as rigidity and subclass proliferation. By understanding these trade-offs, developers can effectively leverage the Template Method pattern to create robust and maintainable software systems.
