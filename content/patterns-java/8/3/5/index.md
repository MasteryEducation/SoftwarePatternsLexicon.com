## 8.3.5 Use Cases and Examples

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations, as well as support for undoable operations. In this section, we delve into practical applications of the Command pattern, exploring its use in GUI applications, task scheduling systems, and transactional behaviors.

### Implementing Menus and Buttons in GUI Applications

One of the most common use cases for the Command pattern is in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), where actions triggered by user interactions, such as clicking a button or selecting a menu item, are encapsulated as command objects. This approach decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.

#### Example: GUI Button Commands

Consider a simple text editor application where users can perform actions like "Open", "Save", and "Close". Each action can be encapsulated as a command object.

```java
// Command interface
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

// Concrete Command for opening a document
class OpenCommand implements Command {
    private Document document;

    public OpenCommand(Document document) {
        this.document = document;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        document.open();
    }
}

// Concrete Command for saving a document
class SaveCommand implements Command {
    private Document document;

    public SaveCommand(Document document) {
        this.document = document;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        document.save();
    }
}

// Concrete Command for closing a document
class CloseCommand implements Command {
    private Document document;

    public CloseCommand(Document document) {
        this.document = document;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        document.close();
    }
}

// Receiver class
class Document {
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Document opened.");
    }

    public void save() {
        System.out.println("Document saved.");
    }

    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Document closed.");
    }
}

// Invoker class
class MenuItem {
    private Command command;

    public MenuItem(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void click() {
        command.execute();
    }
}

// Client code
public class TextEditor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document document = new Document();

        Command openCommand = new OpenCommand(document);
        Command saveCommand = new SaveCommand(document);
        Command closeCommand = new CloseCommand(document);

        MenuItem openMenuItem = new MenuItem(openCommand);
        MenuItem saveMenuItem = new MenuItem(saveCommand);
        MenuItem closeMenuItem = new MenuItem(closeCommand);

        openMenuItem.click();
        saveMenuItem.click();
        closeMenuItem.click();
    }
}
```

In this example, each menu item is associated with a command object, which encapsulates the action to be performed. This design allows for easy extension and modification of commands without altering the invoker or receiver.

#### Benefits in GUI Applications

- **Decoupling**: The Command pattern decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.
- **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Commands can be stored and executed in reverse order to implement undo/redo operations.

### Task Scheduling Systems and Job Queues

The Command pattern is also useful in task scheduling systems, where tasks are encapsulated as command objects and placed in a queue for execution. This approach allows for flexible scheduling and execution of tasks.

#### Example: Task Scheduling System

Consider a task scheduling system where tasks are encapsulated as command objects and executed by a scheduler.

```java
// Command interface
interface Task {
    void execute();
}

// Concrete Task for sending an email
class EmailTask implements Task {
    private String email;

    public EmailTask(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Sending email to " + email);
    }
}

// Concrete Task for generating a report
class ReportTask implements Task {
    private String reportName;

    public ReportTask(String reportName) {
        this.reportName = reportName;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Generating report: " + reportName);
    }
}

// Invoker class
class TaskScheduler {
    private Queue<Task> taskQueue = new LinkedList<>();

    public void addTask(Task task) {
        taskQueue.add(task);
    }

    public void executeTasks() {
        while (!taskQueue.isEmpty()) {
            Task task = taskQueue.poll();
            task.execute();
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class TaskSchedulerDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TaskScheduler scheduler = new TaskScheduler();

        Task emailTask = new EmailTask("example@example.com");
        Task reportTask = new ReportTask("Monthly Report");

        scheduler.addTask(emailTask);
        scheduler.addTask(reportTask);

        scheduler.executeTasks();
    }
}
```

In this example, tasks are encapsulated as command objects and added to a queue. The `TaskScheduler` class is responsible for executing the tasks in the order they were added.

#### Benefits in Task Scheduling Systems

- **Flexibility**: Tasks can be added, removed, or reordered in the queue without affecting the execution logic.
- **Concurrency**: Tasks can be executed concurrently by multiple threads.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Failed tasks can be re-queued for retry.

### Implementing Transactional Behaviors

The Command pattern can be used to implement transactional behaviors, where a series of operations are executed as a single transaction. If any operation fails, the transaction can be rolled back.

#### Example: Banking Transaction

Consider a banking system where transactions are encapsulated as command objects and executed by a transaction manager.

```java
// Command interface
interface Transaction {
    void execute();
    void rollback();
}

// Concrete Transaction for transferring funds
class TransferFundsTransaction implements Transaction {
    private Account fromAccount;
    private Account toAccount;
    private double amount;

    public TransferFundsTransaction(Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {
        this.fromAccount = fromAccount;
        this.toAccount = toAccount;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        if (fromAccount.withdraw(amount)) {
            toAccount.deposit(amount);
            System.out.println("Transferred " + amount + " from " + fromAccount.getAccountNumber() + " to " + toAccount.getAccountNumber());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Transfer failed due to insufficient funds.");
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void rollback() {
        toAccount.withdraw(amount);
        fromAccount.deposit(amount);
        System.out.println("Rolled back transfer of " + amount + " from " + fromAccount.getAccountNumber() + " to " + toAccount.getAccountNumber());
    }
}

// Receiver class
class Account {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    public Account(String accountNumber, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public String getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }
}

// Invoker class
class TransactionManager {
    private List<Transaction> transactionLog = new ArrayList<>();

    public void executeTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        transaction.execute();
        transactionLog.add(transaction);
    }

    public void rollbackTransactions() {
        for (Transaction transaction : transactionLog) {
            transaction.rollback();
        }
        transactionLog.clear();
    }
}

// Client code
public class BankingSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account account1 = new Account("123456", 1000);
        Account account2 = new Account("654321", 500);

        Transaction transferTransaction = new TransferFundsTransaction(account1, account2, 200);

        TransactionManager transactionManager = new TransactionManager();
        transactionManager.executeTransaction(transferTransaction);

        // Simulate a failure and rollback
        transactionManager.rollbackTransactions();
    }
}
```

In this example, a fund transfer is encapsulated as a command object. The `TransactionManager` class is responsible for executing and rolling back transactions.

#### Benefits in Transactional Systems

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that a series of operations are executed as a single atomic transaction.
- **Consistency**: Maintains consistency by rolling back failed transactions.
- **Isolation**: Transactions can be isolated from each other to prevent interference.

### Complexities and Solutions

While the Command pattern offers numerous benefits, it can introduce complexities, particularly in managing command objects and ensuring thread safety in concurrent environments.

#### Complexity: Command Object Management

Managing a large number of command objects can become cumbersome, especially in systems with numerous actions. To address this, consider using a command factory or a command registry to manage command creation and retrieval.

```java
// Command Factory
class CommandFactory {
    private Map<String, Command> commandMap = new HashMap<>();

    public CommandFactory() {
        commandMap.put("open", new OpenCommand(new Document()));
        commandMap.put("save", new SaveCommand(new Document()));
        commandMap.put("close", new CloseCommand(new Document()));
    }

    public Command getCommand(String commandName) {
        return commandMap.get(commandName);
    }
}
```

#### Complexity: Thread Safety

In concurrent environments, ensure that command objects are thread-safe. Use synchronization mechanisms or immutable objects to prevent race conditions.

```java
// Thread-safe Command
class ThreadSafeCommand implements Command {
    private final Document document;

    public ThreadSafeCommand(Document document) {
        this.document = document;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void execute() {
        document.open();
    }
}
```
