## 8.3.2 Invoker, Command, and Receiver Roles

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations. In this section, we delve into the roles of the Invoker, Command, and Receiver, which are the core components of the Command Pattern.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests. It also provides support for undoable operations. The pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the operation being requested or the receiver of the request.

### Key Roles in the Command Pattern

#### 1. Invoker

The **Invoker** is responsible for initiating requests. It holds a reference to the command object and triggers the command's execution. The Invoker does not know anything about the command's implementation or the receiver's details. Its primary role is to call the `execute` method on the command object.

#### 2. Command

The **Command** interface declares a method for executing a command. Concrete implementations of this interface, known as **ConcreteCommands**, encapsulate the action and the receiver. They implement the `execute` method, which calls the appropriate action on the receiver.

#### 3. Receiver

The **Receiver** is the component that knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request. It contains the business logic that is executed when the command's `execute` method is called.

### Interactions Between Components

The interaction between these components can be visualized using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    participant Command
    participant Receiver

    Client->>Invoker: setCommand(command)
    Client->>Invoker: invoke()
    Invoker->>Command: execute()
    Command->>Receiver: action()
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The client sets a command on the invoker. When the invoker's `invoke` method is called, it calls the `execute` method on the command, which in turn calls the appropriate action on the receiver.

### Java Code Example

Let's illustrate these roles with a Java example. Suppose we are implementing a simple remote control system for a home automation system.

#### Command Interface

```java
// Command interface
public interface Command {
    void execute();
}
```

#### ConcreteCommand

```java
// ConcreteCommand class
public class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}
```

#### Receiver

```java
// Receiver class
public class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("The light is on.");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("The light is off.");
    }
}
```

#### Invoker

```java
// Invoker class
public class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Light livingRoomLight = new Light();
        Command lightOn = new LightOnCommand(livingRoomLight);

        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();
        remote.setCommand(lightOn);
        remote.pressButton(); // Output: The light is on.
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Command Interface**: The `Command` interface defines a method `execute()` that all concrete commands must implement.
- **ConcreteCommand**: The `LightOnCommand` class implements the `Command` interface and holds a reference to a `Light` object. The `execute` method calls the `turnOn` method on the `Light` object.
- **Receiver**: The `Light` class is the receiver that knows how to perform the actual work. It has methods `turnOn` and `turnOff`.
- **Invoker**: The `RemoteControl` class acts as the invoker. It stores a command and has a method `pressButton` that calls the command's `execute` method.
- **Client**: The client is responsible for creating the receiver, command, and invoker objects. It sets the command on the invoker and triggers the command execution.

### Practical Applications

The Command Pattern is widely used in GUI applications to handle user actions like button clicks. It is also useful in implementing transaction-based systems where operations need to be queued, logged, or undone.

### Historical Context

The Command Pattern was first introduced in the seminal book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma et al., also known as the "Gang of Four" (GoF). It has since become a staple in software design, particularly in scenarios requiring decoupling of sender and receiver.

### Advanced Java Features

In modern Java, the Command Pattern can be further enhanced using lambda expressions. Since Java 8, you can use lambdas to simplify the creation of command objects, especially when the command interface has a single method.

```java
// Using lambda expressions
RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();
Light livingRoomLight = new Light();

remote.setCommand(() -> livingRoomLight.turnOn());
remote.pressButton(); // Output: The light is on.
```

### Best Practices

- **Decouple the Invoker and Receiver**: Ensure that the invoker does not need to know the details of the receiver's implementation.
- **Use Command Pattern for Undoable Operations**: Implement an `undo` method in the command interface to support undo functionality.
- **Leverage Java 8 Features**: Use lambda expressions to reduce boilerplate code when implementing simple commands.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overuse of the Pattern**: Avoid using the Command Pattern when a simple method call would suffice, as it can introduce unnecessary complexity.
- **Complex Command Logic**: Keep command logic simple and delegate complex operations to the receiver.

### Exercises

1. Modify the example to include a `LightOffCommand` and demonstrate toggling the light state.
2. Implement an `undo` feature for the `LightOnCommand` and `LightOffCommand`.
3. Experiment with using Java Streams to execute a series of commands.

### Summary

The Command Pattern is a powerful tool for decoupling the sender and receiver of a request. By encapsulating requests as objects, it allows for flexible and extensible designs. Understanding the roles of the Invoker, Command, and Receiver is crucial for effectively implementing this pattern in Java applications.
