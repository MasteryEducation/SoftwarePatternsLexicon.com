## 8.3.3 Implementing Undo and Redo

The ability to undo and redo actions is a fundamental feature in many software applications, enhancing user experience by allowing users to revert or reapply changes. Implementing this functionality efficiently requires careful design, and the Command pattern offers a robust solution. This section delves into how the Command pattern can be leveraged to implement undo and redo functionality in Java applications.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where actions need to be executed, undone, or redone.

#### Key Concepts

- **Command Interface**: Defines the `execute` method for executing operations and an `undo` method for reversing them.
- **Concrete Command**: Implements the Command interface and defines the binding between a receiver and an action.
- **Receiver**: The object that performs the actual work when the command's `execute` method is called.
- **Invoker**: Responsible for executing commands. It can also maintain a history of commands for undo/redo functionality.
- **Client**: Creates and configures the command objects.

### Implementing Undo and Redo

To implement undo and redo functionality, commands must store enough state to reverse their actions. This often involves maintaining a history of executed commands and their states.

#### Command Interface with Undo

Start by defining a Command interface that includes both `execute` and `undo` methods:

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}
```

#### Concrete Command Example

Consider a simple text editor application where commands can modify text. A `TextCommand` might look like this:

```java
public class TextCommand implements Command {
    private StringBuilder text;
    private String previousText;
    private String newText;

    public TextCommand(StringBuilder text, String newText) {
        this.text = text;
        this.newText = newText;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        previousText = text.toString();
        text.append(newText);
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        text.setLength(0);
        text.append(previousText);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TextCommand` stores the previous state of the text, allowing it to revert changes when `undo` is called.

#### Managing Command History

To support undo and redo operations, maintain a history of executed commands. Use two stacks: one for undo and another for redo.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class CommandManager {
    private Stack<Command> undoStack = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Command> redoStack = new Stack<>();

    public void executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute();
        undoStack.push(command);
        redoStack.clear(); // Clear redo stack on new command
    }

    public void undo() {
        if (!undoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = undoStack.pop();
            command.undo();
            redoStack.push(command);
        }
    }

    public void redo() {
        if (!redoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = redoStack.pop();
            command.execute();
            undoStack.push(command);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Handling Complex Operations

Complex operations that require multiple steps to undo can be managed by grouping commands. Consider using a composite command that aggregates multiple commands and executes or undoes them as a unit.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CompositeCommand implements Command {
    private List<Command> commands = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addCommand(Command command) {
        commands.add(command);
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        for (Command command : commands) {
            command.execute();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        for (int i = commands.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            commands.get(i).undo();
        }
    }
}
```

### Using Mementos or Snapshots

For applications where state changes are complex or involve multiple objects, consider using the Memento pattern to capture and restore object states. This involves creating a snapshot of the object's state before executing a command.

#### Memento Pattern Overview

The Memento pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. It is particularly useful for implementing undo mechanisms.

```java
public class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

    public Memento createMemento() {
        return new Memento(text.toString());
    }

    public void restore(Memento memento) {
        text.setLength(0);
        text.append(memento.getState());
    }

    public static class Memento {
        private final String state;

        private Memento(String state) {
            this.state = state;
        }

        private String getState() {
            return state;
        }
    }
}
```

### Practical Considerations

- **Performance**: Storing states or commands can consume memory. Optimize by storing only necessary state changes.
- **Concurrency**: Ensure thread safety when commands are executed in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Complexity**: For complex applications, consider using a combination of Command and Memento patterns to manage state efficiently.

### Real-World Scenarios

- **Text Editors**: Implementing undo/redo for text changes.
- **Graphic Design Software**: Reverting changes to graphic elements.
- **Database Transactions**: Rolling back changes in case of errors.

### Conclusion
