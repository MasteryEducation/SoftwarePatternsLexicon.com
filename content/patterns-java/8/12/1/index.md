## 8.12.1 Implementing Visitor in Java

The Visitor pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This separation enables you to add new operations without modifying the objects themselves, promoting flexibility and scalability in your codebase.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Visitor pattern is to define a new operation on a set of objects without changing the objects themselves. It achieves this by allowing you to add new operations to existing object structures without altering their classes. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex object structures where new functionality needs to be added frequently.

### Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: The Visitor pattern promotes a clear separation between the data structure and the operations performed on it.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: It adheres to the open/closed principle by allowing new operations to be added without modifying existing code.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: By centralizing operations in visitor classes, the pattern simplifies maintenance and enhances code readability.
- **Flexibility**: New operations can be added easily by creating new visitor classes.

### Participants

The Visitor pattern involves several key participants:

- **Visitor**: An interface or abstract class that declares a visit operation for each type of `ConcreteElement` in the object structure.
- **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the operations defined in the `Visitor` interface for each type of `ConcreteElement`.
- **Element**: An interface or abstract class that declares an `accept` method, which takes a `Visitor` as an argument.
- **ConcreteElement**: Implements the `Element` interface and defines the `accept` method, which calls the appropriate visit method on the `Visitor`.
- **ObjectStructure**: A class that contains a collection of `Element` objects and provides a mechanism to iterate over them, typically allowing a `Visitor` to visit each element.

### Structure

The following UML diagram illustrates the relationships between the participants in the Visitor pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Visitor {
        <<interface>>
        +visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA)
        +visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB)
    }

    class ConcreteVisitor {
        +visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA)
        +visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB)
    }

    class Element {
        <<interface>>
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    class ConcreteElementA {
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    class ConcreteElementB {
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    class ObjectStructure {
        +elements : List<Element>
        +attach(Element)
        +detach(Element)
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    Visitor <|-- ConcreteVisitor
    Element <|-- ConcreteElementA
    Element <|-- ConcreteElementB
    ConcreteElementA --> Visitor : accept
    ConcreteElementB --> Visitor : accept
    ObjectStructure --> Element : contains
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The diagram shows the `Visitor` interface with visit methods for each `ConcreteElement`. `ConcreteVisitor` implements these methods. `Element` interface is implemented by `ConcreteElementA` and `ConcreteElementB`, each having an `accept` method that takes a `Visitor`. `ObjectStructure` manages a collection of `Element` objects.

### Implementation

#### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Define the Visitor Interface**: Create an interface with a visit method for each type of `ConcreteElement`.
2. **Implement Concrete Visitors**: Create classes that implement the `Visitor` interface, providing specific implementations for each visit method.
3. **Define the Element Interface**: Create an interface with an `accept` method that takes a `Visitor`.
4. **Implement Concrete Elements**: Create classes that implement the `Element` interface, defining the `accept` method to call the appropriate visit method on the `Visitor`.
5. **Create the Object Structure**: Implement a class that holds a collection of `Element` objects and provides a method to accept a `Visitor`.

#### Sample Code Snippets

Below is a Java implementation of the Visitor pattern:

```java
// Visitor interface
interface Visitor {
    void visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA element);
    void visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB element);
}

// ConcreteVisitor class
class ConcreteVisitor implements Visitor {
    @Override
    public void visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA element) {
        System.out.println("Visiting ConcreteElementA");
    }

    @Override
    public void visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB element) {
        System.out.println("Visiting ConcreteElementB");
    }
}

// Element interface
interface Element {
    void accept(Visitor visitor);
}

// ConcreteElementA class
class ConcreteElementA implements Element {
    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visitConcreteElementA(this);
    }
}

// ConcreteElementB class
class ConcreteElementB implements Element {
    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visitConcreteElementB(this);
    }
}

// ObjectStructure class
class ObjectStructure {
    private List<Element> elements = new ArrayList<>();

    public void attach(Element element) {
        elements.add(element);
    }

    public void detach(Element element) {
        elements.remove(element);
    }

    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        for (Element element : elements) {
            element.accept(visitor);
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class VisitorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ObjectStructure objectStructure = new ObjectStructure();
        objectStructure.attach(new ConcreteElementA());
        objectStructure.attach(new ConcreteElementB());

        ConcreteVisitor visitor = new ConcreteVisitor();
        objectStructure.accept(visitor);
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: 
- The `Visitor` interface defines visit methods for `ConcreteElementA` and `ConcreteElementB`.
- `ConcreteVisitor` implements these methods, providing specific functionality for each element type.
- `Element` interface declares an `accept` method, which is implemented by `ConcreteElementA` and `ConcreteElementB`.
- `ObjectStructure` manages a collection of `Element` objects and allows a `Visitor` to visit each element.
- The `VisitorPatternDemo` class demonstrates how to use the Visitor pattern by creating an `ObjectStructure`, adding elements, and applying a `Visitor`.

### Sample Use Cases

- **Compilers**: The Visitor pattern is often used in compilers to perform operations on abstract syntax trees (ASTs), such as type checking or code generation.
- **Document Processing**: In document processing systems, the Visitor pattern can be used to apply operations like formatting or spell-checking to different parts of a document.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Graphics applications can use the Visitor pattern to perform operations like rendering or hit-testing on various graphical elements.

- **Interpreter Pattern**: The Visitor pattern can be used with the [Interpreter Pattern]({{< ref "/patterns-java/8/11" >}} "Interpreter Pattern") to evaluate expressions in a language.

### Known Uses

- **Java AWT**: The AWT event model in Java uses a form of the Visitor pattern to handle events.
- **XML Processing**: Libraries like Apache Xerces use the Visitor pattern to traverse and manipulate XML documents.

### Consequences

- **Advantages**:
  - **Extensibility**: New operations can be added easily by creating new visitor classes.
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Operations are separated from the object structure, enhancing maintainability.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Complexity**: The pattern can introduce complexity, especially when dealing with a large number of element types.
  - **Double Dispatch**: The pattern relies on double dispatch, which can be less intuitive for developers unfamiliar with the concept.

### Exercises

1. **Modify the Visitor Pattern**: Extend the provided code example to include a new `ConcreteElementC` and a corresponding visit method in the `Visitor` interface. Implement a new `ConcreteVisitor` that handles this element.

2. **Experiment with Different Operations**: Create a new visitor that performs a different operation on the elements, such as calculating a sum or generating a report.

3. **Integrate with Other Patterns**: Combine the Visitor pattern with the Composite pattern to perform operations on a tree structure of elements.

### Key Takeaways

- The Visitor pattern is ideal for scenarios where new operations need to be added frequently to a set of objects.
- It promotes the open/closed principle by allowing new functionality to be added without modifying existing code.
- While powerful, the pattern can introduce complexity and requires careful design to manage multiple element types and visitors.
