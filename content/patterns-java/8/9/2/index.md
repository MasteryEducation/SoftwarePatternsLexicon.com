## 8.9.2 Context and State Classes

### Introduction

In the realm of software design patterns, the **State Pattern** is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object must change its behavior based on its state, such as in a finite state machine. The **Context** and **State** classes are pivotal components of the State Pattern, each playing a distinct role in managing state transitions and behavior delegation.

### Context Class

#### Definition and Role

The **Context** class is the primary interface for clients to interact with the State Pattern. It maintains an instance of a `State` subclass that represents the current state of the Context. The Context is responsible for delegating behavior to the current state and managing state transitions.

#### Responsibilities

- **Maintain Current State**: The Context holds a reference to the current state object, which is an instance of a class implementing the `State` interface.
- **Delegate Behavior**: When a client invokes a method on the Context, it delegates the request to the current state object.
- **Manage State Transitions**: The Context is responsible for changing its state when necessary, based on the logic defined within the state objects.

#### Example

Consider a simple example of a `TrafficLight` system, where the Context class manages the current state of the traffic light.

```java
// Context class
public class TrafficLight {
    private TrafficLightState currentState;

    public TrafficLight() {
        // Initial state
        currentState = new RedLightState(this);
    }

    public void setState(TrafficLightState state) {
        currentState = state;
    }

    public void change() {
        currentState.change();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TrafficLight` class maintains a reference to the current `TrafficLightState`. The `change()` method is delegated to the current state, which will handle the transition logic.

### State Interface

#### Definition and Role

The **State** interface defines the methods that all concrete state classes must implement. These methods represent the actions that can be performed in each state. Each concrete state class encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.

#### Responsibilities

- **Define State-Specific Behavior**: Each concrete state class implements the behavior associated with a specific state.
- **Handle State Transitions**: State classes can change the state of the Context by invoking the `setState()` method on the Context.

#### Example

Continuing with the `TrafficLight` example, the `TrafficLightState` interface and its concrete implementations are shown below:

```java
// State interface
interface TrafficLightState {
    void change();
}

// Concrete state classes
class RedLightState implements TrafficLightState {
    private TrafficLight trafficLight;

    public RedLightState(TrafficLight trafficLight) {
        this.trafficLight = trafficLight;
    }

    @Override
    public void change() {
        System.out.println("Changing from Red to Green");
        trafficLight.setState(new GreenLightState(trafficLight));
    }
}

class GreenLightState implements TrafficLightState {
    private TrafficLight trafficLight;

    public GreenLightState(TrafficLight trafficLight) {
        this.trafficLight = trafficLight;
    }

    @Override
    public void change() {
        System.out.println("Changing from Green to Yellow");
        trafficLight.setState(new YellowLightState(trafficLight));
    }
}

class YellowLightState implements TrafficLightState {
    private TrafficLight trafficLight;

    public YellowLightState(TrafficLight trafficLight) {
        this.trafficLight = trafficLight;
    }

    @Override
    public void change() {
        System.out.println("Changing from Yellow to Red");
        trafficLight.setState(new RedLightState(trafficLight));
    }
}
```

In this example, each concrete state class implements the `change()` method, which handles the transition to the next state and updates the Context's state.

### State Transitions and Behavior Delegation

#### State Transitions

State transitions are a critical aspect of the State Pattern. They are typically triggered by invoking methods on the Context, which delegates the call to the current state. The state object then determines the appropriate transition based on its logic.

#### Behavior Delegation

The Context delegates behavior to the current state object, allowing the state to determine the appropriate response. This delegation is a key feature of the State Pattern, as it allows the Context to remain agnostic of the specific state logic.

### Practical Applications

The State Pattern is widely used in scenarios where an object must change its behavior based on its state. Common applications include:

- **User Interface Components**: Managing different states of UI components, such as buttons or dialogs.
- **Game Development**: Handling different states of game objects, such as player characters or enemies.
- **Workflow Systems**: Managing the states of workflows or processes.

### Historical Context and Evolution

The State Pattern has its roots in the concept of finite state machines, which have been used in computer science for decades. The pattern has evolved to become a fundamental part of object-oriented design, providing a robust mechanism for managing state-dependent behavior.

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Encapsulate State Logic**: Keep state-specific logic within the state classes to maintain separation of concerns.
- **Use Interfaces**: Define a common interface for all state classes to ensure consistency and flexibility.
- **Avoid Tight Coupling**: Ensure that state classes are loosely coupled to the Context to facilitate easy maintenance and extension.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overcomplicating State Transitions**: Avoid overly complex state transition logic that can make the system difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Ignoring Performance Impacts**: Be mindful of the performance implications of frequent state transitions, especially in performance-critical applications.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Implement a Vending Machine**: Create a vending machine system using the State Pattern, with states for selecting items, processing payment, and dispensing items.
2. **Extend the Traffic Light Example**: Add additional states to the traffic light system, such as a blinking state for pedestrian crossings.

### Summary

The Context and State classes are integral components of the State Pattern, providing a structured approach to managing state-dependent behavior. By encapsulating state logic within state classes and delegating behavior to the current state, the State Pattern offers a flexible and maintainable solution for complex state management scenarios.
