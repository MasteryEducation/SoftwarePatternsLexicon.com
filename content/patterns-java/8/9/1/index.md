## 8.9.1 Implementing Front Controller in Java

The Front Controller pattern is a crucial design pattern in web application architecture. It provides a centralized entry point for handling all incoming requests, allowing for a streamlined and organized approach to request processing. In this section, we will explore how to implement a Front Controller in Java using servlets, which are a fundamental component of Java web applications.

### Understanding the Front Controller Pattern

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly understand the Front Controller pattern. This pattern involves a single controller that handles all requests for a web application. The controller is responsible for:

- Intercepting incoming requests.
- Delegating requests to appropriate handlers or views.
- Managing application-wide concerns such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

By centralizing control, the Front Controller pattern simplifies request processing and enhances maintainability.

### Setting Up a Front Controller Using Java Servlets

Java servlets provide an excellent mechanism for implementing a Front Controller. A servlet can be configured to intercept all incoming requests to the application, acting as the central point of control.

#### Step 1: Creating the Front Controller Servlet

To start, we need to create a servlet that will serve as the Front Controller. This servlet will intercept all requests and delegate them to appropriate handlers based on the request URL or parameters.

```java
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/*")
public class FrontControllerServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        processRequest(request, response);
    }

    @Override
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        processRequest(request, response);
    }

    private void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String action = request.getParameter("action");
        if (action == null) {
            action = "default";
        }

        switch (action) {
            case "view":
                forwardToView(request, response);
                break;
            case "edit":
                forwardToEdit(request, response);
                break;
            default:
                forwardToDefault(request, response);
                break;
        }
    }

    private void forwardToView(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        request.getRequestDispatcher("/view.jsp").forward(request, response);
    }

    private void forwardToEdit(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        request.getRequestDispatcher("/edit.jsp").forward(request, response);
    }

    private void forwardToDefault(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        request.getRequestDispatcher("/default.jsp").forward(request, response);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Annotation `@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/*")`:** This annotation configures the servlet to intercept all requests to the application. The `/*` pattern ensures that every request is routed through this servlet.
- **`processRequest` Method:** This method determines the action to be taken based on request parameters and forwards the request to the appropriate handler or view.

#### Step 2: Configuring the Servlet

The servlet configuration is crucial for ensuring that the Front Controller intercepts all requests. The `@WebServlet` annotation is used to define the URL pattern that the servlet should handle. In this case, `/*` is used to capture all requests.

#### Step 3: Using a Dispatcher for Request Handling

The Front Controller servlet uses a dispatcher to forward requests to specific handlers or views. This is typically done using the `RequestDispatcher` interface, which allows for forwarding requests to other resources within the application.

### Best Practices for Implementing a Front Controller

Implementing a Front Controller involves more than just setting up a servlet. Here are some best practices to consider:

#### Organize Request Handling Logic

- **Use Command Patterns or Action Classes:** Organize request handling logic into separate classes or components. This approach makes the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.
  
```java
public interface Command {
    void execute(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException;
}

public class ViewCommand implements Command {
    @Override
    public void execute(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        request.getRequestDispatcher("/view.jsp").forward(request, response);
    }
}

public class EditCommand implements Command {
    @Override
    public void execute(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        request.getRequestDispatcher("/edit.jsp").forward(request, response);
    }
}
```

- **Command Pattern Implementation:** Define a `Command` interface and implement different commands for various actions. This pattern helps in decoupling the action logic from the controller.

#### Centralize Exception and Error Management

- **Global Exception Handling:** Implement a centralized mechanism for handling exceptions and errors. This can be done using a custom error page or a dedicated error-handling servlet.

```java
@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/error")
public class ErrorHandlerServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Throwable throwable = (Throwable) request.getAttribute("javax.servlet.error.exception");
        Integer statusCode = (Integer) request.getAttribute("javax.servlet.error.status_code");
        
        request.setAttribute("errorMessage", throwable != null ? throwable.getMessage() : "Unknown error");
        request.setAttribute("statusCode", statusCode);
        request.getRequestDispatcher("/error.jsp").forward(request, response);
    }
}
```

- **Error Handling Servlet:** This servlet captures exceptions and forwards the user to a custom error page.

#### Support Extension and Modification

- **Flexible Request Handling:** Design the Front Controller to support easy extension and modification. This can be achieved by using configuration files or annotations to define new request handlers.

```java
public class CommandFactory {
    public static Command getCommand(String action) {
        switch (action) {
            case "view":
                return new ViewCommand();
            case "edit":
                return new EditCommand();
            default:
                return new DefaultCommand();
        }
    }
}
```

- **Command Factory:** Use a factory pattern to create command instances based on the action. This approach allows for adding new commands without modifying the Front Controller.

### Visualizing the Front Controller Architecture

To better understand the flow of requests in a Front Controller pattern, let's visualize the architecture using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant FrontController
    participant CommandFactory
    participant Command
    participant View

    Client->>FrontController: HTTP Request
    FrontController->>CommandFactory: Get Command
    CommandFactory->>FrontController: Return Command
    FrontController->>Command: Execute Command
    Command->>View: Forward to View
    View-->>Client: Rendered Response
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Client:** Initiates an HTTP request to the application.
- **FrontController:** Intercepts the request and delegates it to the appropriate command.
- **CommandFactory:** Determines the command to execute based on the request.
- **Command:** Executes the action and forwards the request to the appropriate view.
- **View:** Renders the response back to the client.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Add a New Command:** Implement a new command class and update the `CommandFactory` to handle a new action.
- **Customize Error Handling:** Create a more detailed error page that displays additional information about the error.
- **Experiment with URL Patterns:** Change the URL pattern in the `@WebServlet` annotation to see how it affects request handling.
