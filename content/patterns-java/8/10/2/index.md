## 8.10.2 Functional Strategies with Lambdas

### Introduction

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. Traditionally, this pattern involves defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. However, with the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8, implementing the Strategy Pattern has become more streamlined and concise. This section explores how Java 8's lambda expressions can simplify the Strategy Pattern, enhancing code readability and reducing boilerplate.

### Understanding the Strategy Pattern

#### Intent

The Strategy Pattern allows the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

#### Structure

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Context --> Strategy
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB

    class Context {
        - Strategy strategy
        + setStrategy(Strategy strategy)
        + executeStrategy()
    }

    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        + execute()
    }

    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        + execute()
    }

    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        + execute()
    }
```

### Implementing Strategy Pattern with Lambdas

#### Traditional Approach

In the traditional approach, implementing the Strategy Pattern involves creating multiple classes that implement a common interface. Consider a simple example where we have different strategies for sorting a list.

```java
// Strategy Interface
interface SortingStrategy {
    void sort(int[] numbers);
}

// Concrete Strategy A
class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        // Implementation of bubble sort
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy B
class QuickSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        // Implementation of quick sort
    }
}

// Context
class Sorter {
    private SortingStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        strategy.sort(numbers);
    }
}
```

#### Simplifying with Lambdas

With Java 8, the Strategy Pattern can be simplified using lambda expressions, which are essentially anonymous functions that can be treated as instances of functional interfaces. A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method, making it a perfect candidate for lambda expressions.

```java
// Functional Interface
@FunctionalInterface
interface SortingStrategy {
    void sort(int[] numbers);
}

// Context
class Sorter {
    private SortingStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        strategy.sort(numbers);
    }
}

// Usage
public class StrategyPatternWithLambdas {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sorter sorter = new Sorter();

        // Using lambda for bubble sort
        sorter.setStrategy((numbers) -> {
            // Bubble sort implementation
        });
        sorter.sort(new int[]{5, 3, 8, 1});

        // Using lambda for quick sort
        sorter.setStrategy((numbers) -> {
            // Quick sort implementation
        });
        sorter.sort(new int[]{5, 3, 8, 1});
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Using Lambdas

#### Reduced Boilerplate Code

Lambdas significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement the Strategy Pattern. Instead of creating separate classes for each strategy, developers can define strategies inline using lambda expressions.

#### Enhanced Readability

Lambdas enhance code readability by allowing developers to focus on the logic rather than the structure. The strategy logic is defined where it is used, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

#### Improved Conciseness

By using lambdas, the Strategy Pattern implementation becomes more concise. This conciseness is particularly beneficial when dealing with simple strategies that do not require extensive logic.

### Limitations and Considerations

#### Complexity of Logic

While lambdas are excellent for simple strategies, they may not be suitable for complex logic. In such cases, traditional class-based implementations might be more appropriate to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.

#### Debugging Challenges

Debugging lambda expressions can be challenging, especially when errors occur within the lambda body. Developers should ensure that lambdas are used judiciously and that complex logic is well-documented.

#### Performance Considerations

While lambdas offer syntactic sugar, they may introduce performance overhead due to the creation of additional objects. Developers should profile their applications to ensure that lambda usage does not adversely affect performance.

### Practical Applications

#### Real-World Scenario: Payment Processing

Consider a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods such as credit card, PayPal, and bank transfer. Using the Strategy Pattern with lambdas, each payment method can be implemented as a lambda expression.

```java
// Functional Interface for Payment Strategy
@FunctionalInterface
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(double amount);
}

// Context
class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        strategy.pay(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
public class PaymentSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentProcessor processor = new PaymentProcessor();

        // Credit card payment
        processor.setStrategy(amount -> System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card"));
        processor.processPayment(100.0);

        // PayPal payment
        processor.setStrategy(amount -> System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal"));
        processor.processPayment(200.0);

        // Bank transfer
        processor.setStrategy(amount -> System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Bank Transfer"));
        processor.processPayment(300.0);
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

The use of lambda expressions in implementing the Strategy Pattern offers significant advantages in terms of reducing boilerplate code, enhancing readability, and improving conciseness. However, developers should be mindful of the limitations and ensure that lambdas are used appropriately, especially in scenarios involving complex logic or performance-sensitive applications.
