## 8.10.3 Context and Strategy Interfaces

The Strategy pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that enables a family of algorithms to be defined and encapsulated within a set of interchangeable classes. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. At the heart of the Strategy pattern are two critical components: the `Context` and the `Strategy` interfaces. Understanding these components and their interactions is essential for effectively implementing the Strategy pattern in Java.

### Understanding the Context and Strategy Interfaces

#### The Role of the Context

The `Context` is a class that maintains a reference to a `Strategy` object. It is responsible for interacting with the `Strategy` interface to execute the algorithm defined by the concrete strategy classes. The `Context` does not implement the algorithm itself; instead, it delegates the execution to the `Strategy` object it holds.

The primary responsibilities of the `Context` include:

- **Maintaining a reference to a `Strategy` object**: The `Context` holds a reference to a `Strategy` object, which it uses to execute the algorithm.
- **Delegating algorithm execution**: The `Context` delegates the execution of the algorithm to the `Strategy` object.
- **Providing a method to set or change the `Strategy`**: The `Context` allows the strategy to be set or changed at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior.

#### The Role of the Strategy Interface

The `Strategy` interface defines a common interface for all concrete strategy classes. Each concrete strategy class implements this interface to provide a specific algorithm. The `Strategy` interface ensures that the `Context` can interact with any concrete strategy class in a consistent manner.

The primary responsibilities of the `Strategy` interface include:

- **Defining a common interface for algorithms**: The `Strategy` interface defines the method(s) that all concrete strategy classes must implement.
- **Ensuring consistency**: By providing a common interface, the `Strategy` interface ensures that the `Context` can interact with different strategy implementations interchangeably.

### Implementing the Strategy Pattern in Java

To illustrate the implementation of the Strategy pattern in Java, consider a simple example of a payment processing system. The system supports multiple payment methods, such as credit card, PayPal, and bank transfer. Each payment method represents a different strategy for processing payments.

#### Step 1: Define the Strategy Interface

First, define the `Strategy` interface that declares the method for processing payments.

```java
// Strategy interface for payment processing
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Strategy Classes

Next, implement concrete strategy classes for each payment method.

```java
// Concrete strategy for credit card payment
public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String cardNumber;
    private String cardHolderName;

    public CreditCardPayment(String cardNumber, String cardHolderName) {
        this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
        this.cardHolderName = cardHolderName;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
        // Implement credit card payment logic here
    }
}

// Concrete strategy for PayPal payment
public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String email;

    public PayPalPayment(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of $" + amount);
        // Implement PayPal payment logic here
    }
}

// Concrete strategy for bank transfer payment
public class BankTransferPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String bankAccount;

    public BankTransferPayment(String bankAccount) {
        this.bankAccount = bankAccount;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing bank transfer payment of $" + amount);
        // Implement bank transfer payment logic here
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Context Class

Implement the `Context` class that uses a `PaymentStrategy` to process payments.

```java
// Context class for payment processing
public class PaymentContext {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public PaymentContext(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Demonstrate Strategy Pattern Usage

Demonstrate how to use the `PaymentContext` to process payments with different strategies.

```java
public class StrategyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a payment context with a credit card strategy
        PaymentContext context = new PaymentContext(new CreditCardPayment("1234-5678-9012-3456", "John Doe"));
        context.processPayment(100.0);

        // Change the strategy to PayPal
        context.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment("john.doe@example.com"));
        context.processPayment(200.0);

        // Change the strategy to bank transfer
        context.setPaymentStrategy(new BankTransferPayment("987654321"));
        context.processPayment(300.0);
    }
}
```

### Considerations for Passing Data Between Context and Strategy

When implementing the Strategy pattern, it is important to consider how data is passed between the `Context` and the `Strategy`. The `Context` may need to provide data to the `Strategy` to execute the algorithm. There are several approaches to achieve this:

- **Constructor Injection**: Pass necessary data to the `Strategy` through its constructor. This approach is suitable when the data is constant and does not change during the lifetime of the `Strategy`.
- **Method Parameters**: Pass data as parameters to the method defined in the `Strategy` interface. This approach is flexible and allows the `Context` to provide different data for each method call.
- **Context Methods**: Provide methods in the `Context` to retrieve data needed by the `Strategy`. This approach is useful when the `Strategy` needs to access data maintained by the `Context`.

### Importance of Clear Interface Definitions

Clear and well-defined interfaces are crucial for the successful implementation of the Strategy pattern. The `Strategy` interface should be designed to accommodate different algorithms while maintaining consistency. Consider the following best practices when defining interfaces:

- **Simplicity**: Keep the interface simple and focused on the essential methods required for the algorithm.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that all concrete strategy classes implement the interface consistently, allowing the `Context` to interact with them interchangeably.
- **Flexibility**: Design the interface to be flexible enough to accommodate future changes or additions to the algorithms.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

The Strategy pattern is widely used in various real-world scenarios where multiple algorithms are applicable. Some common applications include:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing different sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) as strategies and allowing the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
- **Compression Algorithms**: Providing different compression strategies (e.g., ZIP, GZIP) for compressing data.
- **Payment Processing**: As demonstrated in the example, implementing different payment methods as strategies for processing payments.

### Historical Context and Evolution

The Strategy pattern is one of the original design patterns introduced by the "Gang of Four" (GoF) in their seminal book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software." Over the years, the pattern has evolved to accommodate modern programming paradigms and technologies. With the advent of functional programming and lambda expressions in Java 8, the Strategy pattern can be implemented more concisely using lambda expressions.

#### Using Lambda Expressions in Java

Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, which provide a more concise way to implement the Strategy pattern. Instead of creating separate classes for each strategy, you can use lambda expressions to define the strategy inline.

```java
public class LambdaStrategyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Use lambda expression for credit card payment strategy
        PaymentStrategy creditCardPayment = (amount) -> System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
        
        // Use lambda expression for PayPal payment strategy
        PaymentStrategy payPalPayment = (amount) -> System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of $" + amount);
        
        // Use lambda expression for bank transfer payment strategy
        PaymentStrategy bankTransferPayment = (amount) -> System.out.println("Processing bank transfer payment of $" + amount);
        
        // Create a payment context and process payments with different strategies
        PaymentContext context = new PaymentContext(creditCardPayment);
        context.processPayment(100.0);
        
        context.setPaymentStrategy(payPalPayment);
        context.processPayment(200.0);
        
        context.setPaymentStrategy(bankTransferPayment);
        context.processPayment(300.0);
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

While the Strategy pattern offers flexibility and extensibility, there are common pitfalls to be aware of:

- **Overcomplicating the Interface**: Avoid adding unnecessary methods to the `Strategy` interface. Keep it simple and focused on the algorithm.
- **Tight Coupling**: Ensure that the `Context` and `Strategy` are loosely coupled. The `Context` should not depend on the implementation details of the `Strategy`.
- **Inappropriate Use**: Avoid using the Strategy pattern when the algorithm does not vary or when there is only one implementation.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

To reinforce your understanding of the Strategy pattern, consider the following exercises:

1. Implement a strategy pattern for a text formatting application that supports different formatting strategies (e.g., plain text, HTML, Markdown).
2. Modify the payment processing example to include a new payment method (e.g., cryptocurrency) and demonstrate how to integrate it into the existing system.
3. Explore the use of lambda expressions to implement the Strategy pattern in a different domain, such as data filtering or transformation.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

The Strategy pattern is a versatile design pattern that promotes flexibility and extensibility by allowing algorithms to be defined and encapsulated within interchangeable classes. The `Context` and `Strategy` interfaces play a crucial role in the pattern, enabling dynamic behavior and consistent interaction. By understanding the roles of these interfaces and following best practices, you can effectively implement the Strategy pattern in Java and apply it to a wide range of real-world scenarios.
