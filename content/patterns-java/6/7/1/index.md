## 6.7.1 Implementing Future in Java

In the realm of Java concurrency, the `Future` interface and its more advanced counterpart, `CompletableFuture`, play pivotal roles in enabling asynchronous programming. These constructs allow developers to execute tasks asynchronously, improving application responsiveness and performance. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of implementing `Future` in Java, explore the limitations of `Future`, and introduce the more powerful `CompletableFuture` and `CompletionStage` for advanced asynchronous computations.

### Understanding the Future Interface

The `Future` interface in Java, introduced in Java 5, represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It provides methods to check if the computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result. Let's explore the key methods of the `Future` interface:

- **`get()`**: Waits for the computation to complete and retrieves its result. This method blocks the calling thread until the result is available.
- **`isDone()`**: Returns `true` if the computation is complete, regardless of whether it completed successfully or failed.
- **`cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)`**: Attempts to cancel the execution of the task.
- **`isCancelled()`**: Returns `true` if the task was cancelled before it completed.

#### Code Example: Using Future

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Simulate a long-running task
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            return 42;
        });

        try {
            System.out.println("Future result: " + future.get()); // This will block until the result is available
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we submit a task to an `ExecutorService` that returns a `Future`. The `get()` method is called to retrieve the result, blocking the main thread until the task completes.

### Limitations of Future

While `Future` provides a basic mechanism for asynchronous computation, it has several limitations:

1. **Blocking Operations**: The `get()` method blocks the calling thread until the result is available, which can lead to performance bottlenecks.
2. **No Direct Support for Callbacks**: `Future` does not provide a way to specify actions to be performed upon task completion.
3. **No Chaining of Tasks**: It lacks the ability to chain multiple asynchronous tasks together.

### Introducing CompletableFuture

To overcome the limitations of `Future`, Java 8 introduced `CompletableFuture`, which implements both `Future` and `CompletionStage` interfaces. `CompletableFuture` provides a comprehensive API for asynchronous programming, including support for non-blocking operations, callbacks, and task chaining.

#### Key Features of CompletableFuture

- **Non-blocking Operations**: Methods like `thenApply`, `thenAccept`, and `thenRun` allow you to specify actions to be executed upon task completion without blocking.
- **Task Chaining**: `CompletableFuture` supports chaining of tasks, enabling complex asynchronous workflows.
- **Exception Handling**: Methods like `exceptionally` and `handle` provide mechanisms for handling exceptions in asynchronous computations.

#### Code Example: Using CompletableFuture

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Simulate a long-running task
            sleep(2000);
            return 42;
        }).thenApply(result -> {
            // Process the result
            return "Result: " + result;
        }).thenAccept(System.out::println)
          .exceptionally(ex -> {
              System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.getMessage());
              return null;
          });

        // Keep the main thread alive to see the result
        sleep(3000);
    }

    private static void sleep(int milliseconds) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` is used to execute a task asynchronously. The `thenApply` method processes the result, and `thenAccept` prints it. The `exceptionally` method handles any exceptions that occur during the computation.

### Chaining Tasks with CompletableFuture

One of the most powerful features of `CompletableFuture` is its ability to chain tasks together. This allows you to build complex asynchronous workflows with ease.

#### Code Example: Chaining Tasks

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureChaining {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // First task
            sleep(1000);
            return "Task 1";
        }).thenCompose(result -> {
            // Second task, dependent on the first
            return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                sleep(1000);
                return result + " -> Task 2";
            });
        }).thenCompose(result -> {
            // Third task, dependent on the second
            return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                sleep(1000);
                return result + " -> Task 3";
            });
        }).thenAccept(System.out::println);

        // Keep the main thread alive to see the result
        sleep(4000);
    }

    private static void sleep(int milliseconds) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `thenCompose` is used to chain tasks together. Each task depends on the result of the previous one, allowing for sequential execution of asynchronous tasks.

### Handling Results with Callbacks

`CompletableFuture` provides several methods for handling results using callbacks. These methods allow you to specify actions to be performed when a computation completes, without blocking the calling thread.

#### Key Methods for Callbacks

- **`thenApply(Function)`**: Transforms the result of a computation.
- **`thenAccept(Consumer)`**: Consumes the result of a computation.
- **`thenRun(Runnable)`**: Executes a runnable after the computation completes.
- **`exceptionally(Function)`**: Handles exceptions that occur during the computation.
- **`handle(BiFunction)`**: Processes the result or exception of a computation.

#### Code Example: Handling Results with Callbacks

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureCallbacks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Simulate a task
            sleep(1000);
            return "Hello";
        }).thenApply(result -> result + " World")
          .thenAccept(System.out::println)
          .exceptionally(ex -> {
              System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.getMessage());
              return null;
          });

        // Keep the main thread alive to see the result
        sleep(2000);
    }

    private static void sleep(int milliseconds) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `thenApply` is used to transform the result, `thenAccept` prints it, and `exceptionally` handles any exceptions.

### Benefits of Non-blocking Operations

Non-blocking operations are a cornerstone of modern asynchronous programming. They allow applications to perform other tasks while waiting for a computation to complete, leading to improved responsiveness and resource utilization.

#### Advantages of Non-blocking Operations

- **Improved Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations prevent the application from freezing while waiting for a task to complete.
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Threads can be used more efficiently, as they are not idly waiting for tasks to finish.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Applications can handle more concurrent tasks without being constrained by thread availability.

### Thread Management Considerations

When working with asynchronous computations, it's crucial to manage threads effectively. `CompletableFuture` provides several methods for controlling the execution of tasks on different threads.

#### Key Thread Management Methods

- **`supplyAsync(Supplier)`**: Executes a task asynchronously using the common fork-join pool.
- **`supplyAsync(Supplier, Executor)`**: Executes a task asynchronously using a specified executor.
- **`runAsync(Runnable)`**: Executes a runnable asynchronously.
- **`runAsync(Runnable, Executor)`**: Executes a runnable asynchronously using a specified executor.

#### Code Example: Thread Management with CompletableFuture

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class CompletableFutureThreadManagement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Task 1
            sleep(1000);
            return "Task 1";
        }, executor).thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result));

        CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            // Task 2
            sleep(1000);
            System.out.println("Task 2 completed");
        }, executor);

        // Allow time for tasks to complete
        sleep(3000);
        executor.shutdown();
    }

    private static void sleep(int milliseconds) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, tasks are executed using a custom executor, allowing for more control over thread management.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by making the following modifications:

1. **Change the Executor**: Modify the executor to use a different thread pool configuration and observe the impact on task execution.
2. **Add More Tasks**: Add additional tasks to the `CompletableFuture` chains and explore how the results are combined.
3. **Handle Exceptions**: Introduce exceptions in the tasks and implement custom exception handling logic.

### Visualizing Asynchronous Computations

To better understand the flow of asynchronous computations, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as Main Thread
    participant Executor as Executor
    participant Task1 as Task 1
    participant Task2 as Task 2

    Main->>Executor: Submit Task 1
    Executor->>Task1: Execute
    Task1-->>Executor: Complete
    Executor->>Main: Notify Completion

    Main->>Executor: Submit Task 2
    Executor->>Task2: Execute
    Task2-->>Executor: Complete
    Executor->>Main: Notify Completion
```

This diagram illustrates the submission and execution of tasks in an asynchronous workflow. The main thread submits tasks to the executor, which executes them and notifies the main thread upon completion.
