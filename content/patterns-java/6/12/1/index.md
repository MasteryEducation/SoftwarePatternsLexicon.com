## 6.12.1 Implementing DAO for Database Interaction

The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO pattern provides specific data operations without exposing details of the database. This pattern is particularly useful in Java for managing database operations, as it separates the data access logic from the business logic, thereby promoting a cleaner architecture and easier maintenance.

### Intent

- **Purpose**: The DAO pattern aims to abstract and encapsulate all access to the data source, providing a clean separation between the business logic and data access logic. This separation enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability of the application.

### Motivation

In complex applications, direct interaction with the database can lead to tightly coupled code, making it difficult to maintain and test. The DAO pattern addresses this issue by providing a layer of abstraction over the data source. This allows developers to change the underlying data source without affecting the business logic.

### Applicability

Use the DAO pattern when:

- You need to separate data access logic from business logic.
- You want to provide a uniform API for accessing data from different sources.
- You aim to improve the testability of your application by mocking data access during testing.

### Structure

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Client {
        +execute()
    }
    class DAO {
        <<interface>>
        +getData()
        +saveData()
    }
    class ConcreteDAO {
        +getData()
        +saveData()
    }
    class DataSource {
        +connect()
        +disconnect()
    }

    Client --> DAO
    DAO <|-- ConcreteDAO
    ConcreteDAO --> DataSource
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The diagram illustrates the relationship between the client, DAO interface, concrete DAO implementation, and the data source. The client interacts with the DAO interface, which is implemented by the concrete DAO class. The concrete DAO class handles the actual data source operations.

### Participants

- **Client**: The component that uses the DAO to perform data operations.
- **DAO Interface**: Defines the standard operations to be performed on a model object(s).
- **Concrete DAO**: Implements the DAO interface and provides the actual data source interaction.
- **Data Source**: The actual database or persistence mechanism.

### Collaborations

- The **Client** interacts with the **DAO Interface** to perform data operations.
- The **Concrete DAO** implements the **DAO Interface** and interacts with the **Data Source** to perform the actual database operations.

### Consequences

- **Benefits**:
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Isolates data access logic from business logic.
  - **Maintainability**: Simplifies code maintenance by centralizing data access logic.
  - **Testability**: Facilitates unit testing by allowing data access to be mocked.
  - **Flexibility**: Allows changes to the data source without affecting business logic.

- **Drawbacks**:
  - **Complexity**: Introduces additional layers, which can complicate the architecture.
  - **Performance**: May introduce slight overhead due to abstraction.

### Implementation

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define the DAO Interface**: Create an interface that declares the methods for data operations.

    ```java
    public interface UserDAO {
        User getUserById(int id);
        List<User> getAllUsers();
        void saveUser(User user);
        void deleteUser(int id);
    }
    ```

2. **Implement the DAO Interface**: Create a concrete class that implements the DAO interface using JDBC for database operations.

    ```java
    import java.sql.*;
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.List;

    public class UserDAOImpl implements UserDAO {
        private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
        private static final String USER = "username";
        private static final String PASSWORD = "password";

        @Override
        public User getUserById(int id) {
            User user = null;
            try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
                 PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")) {
                statement.setInt(1, id);
                ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
                if (resultSet.next()) {
                    user = new User(resultSet.getInt("id"), resultSet.getString("name"), resultSet.getString("email"));
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return user;
        }

        @Override
        public List<User> getAllUsers() {
            List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
            try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
                 Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
                ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
                while (resultSet.next()) {
                    users.add(new User(resultSet.getInt("id"), resultSet.getString("name"), resultSet.getString("email")));
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return users;
        }

        @Override
        public void saveUser(User user) {
            try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
                 PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)")) {
                statement.setString(1, user.getName());
                statement.setString(2, user.getEmail());
                statement.executeUpdate();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void deleteUser(int id) {
            try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
                 PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?")) {
                statement.setInt(1, id);
                statement.executeUpdate();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Create the Model Class**: Define the model class that represents the data structure.

    ```java
    public class User {
        private int id;
        private String name;
        private String email;

        public User(int id, String name, String email) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
            this.email = email;
        }

        // Getters and setters
    }
    ```

4. **Use the DAO in Business Logic**: Integrate the DAO into the business logic layer.

    ```java
    public class UserService {
        private UserDAO userDAO = new UserDAOImpl();

        public User getUserById(int id) {
            return userDAO.getUserById(id);
        }

        public List<User> getAllUsers() {
            return userDAO.getAllUsers();
        }

        public void saveUser(User user) {
            userDAO.saveUser(user);
        }

        public void deleteUser(int id) {
            userDAO.deleteUser(id);
        }
    }
    ```
