## 31.1.3 Implementing MVC with Spring Boot

### Introduction

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a cornerstone of web application architecture, providing a structured approach to separate concerns within an application. Spring Boot, coupled with the Spring MVC framework, offers a robust platform for implementing the MVC pattern, enabling developers to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications. This section explores the integration of MVC with Spring Boot, detailing the steps to create a Spring Boot application using MVC architecture, mapping requests with annotations, and utilizing templating engines like Thymeleaf.

### Understanding Spring MVC

Spring MVC is a part of the Spring Framework that provides a comprehensive infrastructure for developing web applications. It follows the MVC design pattern, which divides an application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays data to the user and sends user commands to the controller.
- **Controller**: Handles user requests, processes them, and returns the appropriate view.

Spring MVC simplifies the development process by providing a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage complex applications.

### Setting Up a Spring Boot Application

To implement the MVC pattern with Spring Boot, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Spring Boot Project**: Use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new Spring Boot project. Select dependencies such as Spring Web and Thymeleaf.

2. **Configure Application Properties**: Modify the `application.properties` file to set up essential configurations like server port and view resolver.

3. **Define the Model**: Create Java classes representing the application's data structure.

4. **Create the Controller**: Implement controllers using the `@Controller` annotation to handle HTTP requests.

5. **Design the View**: Use Thymeleaf templates to render the data provided by the controller.

### Mapping Requests with Controllers

In Spring MVC, controllers are responsible for processing incoming requests and returning the appropriate response. Use the `@Controller` annotation to define a controller class and `@RequestMapping` to map URLs to specific methods.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/greeting")
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping
    public String greet(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "greeting";
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the `GreetingController` class is annotated with `@Controller`, indicating that it is a web controller. The `@RequestMapping("/greeting")` annotation maps the `/greeting` URL to this controller. The `greet` method handles GET requests and adds a message to the model, which is then displayed in the view named `greeting`.

### Using Models to Pass Data to Views

Models in Spring MVC are used to pass data from the controller to the view. The `Model` interface provides methods to add attributes that can be accessed in the view.

```java
@GetMapping("/user")
public String user(Model model) {
    User user = new User("John", "Doe");
    model.addAttribute("user", user);
    return "userProfile";
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, a `User` object is created and added to the model. The `userProfile` view can access this object and display its properties.

### Integrating Thymeleaf with Spring MVC

Thymeleaf is a popular templating engine for rendering views in Spring MVC applications. It provides a natural way to create HTML templates that can dynamically display data from the model.

#### Setting Up Thymeleaf

To use Thymeleaf, include it as a dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Creating a Thymeleaf Template

Create a Thymeleaf template in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory. Use Thymeleaf syntax to bind data from the model.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <title>Greeting</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 th:text="${message}">Default Message</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation**: The `th:text` attribute is used to bind the `message` attribute from the model to the HTML element.

### Best Practices for Organizing Code

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep the model, view, and controller components separate to maintain a clean architecture.
- **Use Annotations**: Leverage Spring annotations like `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@ModelAttribute` for clear and concise code.
- **Dependency Management**: Use Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies and ensure that all required libraries are included.
- **Error Handling**: Implement global exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice` to manage errors gracefully.

### Conclusion

Implementing the MVC pattern with Spring Boot and Spring MVC provides a powerful framework for developing web applications. By following best practices and leveraging tools like Thymeleaf, developers can create applications that are both efficient and easy to maintain. Experiment with the provided code examples, modify them to suit your needs, and explore the vast capabilities of Spring Boot and Spring MVC.
