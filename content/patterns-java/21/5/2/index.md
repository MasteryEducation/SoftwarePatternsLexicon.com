## 21.5.2 Parallel Processing

Parallel processing is a critical component of high-performance computing, enabling applications to leverage multi-core processors to perform computations more efficiently. In Java, parallel processing can be achieved through various APIs and frameworks, each offering unique capabilities and optimizations. This section delves into these techniques, providing insights into their practical applications, challenges, and best practices.

### Introduction to Parallel Processing

Parallel processing involves dividing a computational task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently across multiple processors or cores. This approach can significantly reduce execution time and improve throughput, making it ideal for compute-intensive applications such as scientific simulations, data analysis, and real-time processing.

Java provides several tools and frameworks to facilitate parallel processing, including:

- **Fork/Join Framework**: A framework designed for parallelizing tasks that can be recursively split into smaller tasks.
- **Parallel Streams**: A feature of the Java Streams API that allows for parallel execution of stream operations.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: A set of classes and interfaces in the `java.util.concurrent` package that support concurrent programming.

### Fork/Join Framework

#### Overview

The Fork/Join framework, introduced in Java 7, is designed to take advantage of multi-core processors by breaking down tasks into smaller, independent sub-tasks. It uses a work-stealing algorithm to efficiently distribute tasks among available processor cores.

#### Key Components

- **ForkJoinPool**: The central component of the Fork/Join framework, responsible for managing and executing tasks.
- **RecursiveTask**: A subclass of `ForkJoinTask` used for tasks that return a result.
- **RecursiveAction**: A subclass of `ForkJoinTask` used for tasks that do not return a result.

#### Implementation

To implement the Fork/Join framework, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Task**: Create a class that extends `RecursiveTask` or `RecursiveAction`.
2. **Implement the Compute Method**: Override the `compute` method to define the task's logic, including the conditions for splitting the task.
3. **Invoke the Task**: Use a `ForkJoinPool` to execute the task.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;

public class FibonacciTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    private final int n;

    public FibonacciTask(int n) {
        this.n = n;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }
        FibonacciTask f1 = new FibonacciTask(n - 1);
        f1.fork(); // Asynchronously execute f1
        FibonacciTask f2 = new FibonacciTask(n - 2);
        return f2.compute() + f1.join(); // Wait for f1 to complete and combine results
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        FibonacciTask task = new FibonacciTask(10);
        int result = pool.invoke(task);
        System.out.println("Fibonacci(10) = " + result);
    }
}
```

#### Best Practices

- **Task Granularity**: Ensure tasks are neither too small nor too large to avoid overhead or underutilization of resources.
- **Avoid Shared State**: Minimize shared mutable state to prevent synchronization issues.
- **Leverage Work-Stealing**: Utilize the work-stealing algorithm to balance the load across threads.

### Parallel Streams

#### Overview

Parallel streams, introduced in Java 8, provide a high-level abstraction for parallel processing. They allow developers to process collections in parallel with minimal code changes, leveraging the underlying Fork/Join framework.

#### Usage

To create a parallel stream, simply call the `parallelStream()` method on a collection or convert an existing stream using the `parallel()` method.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList());

        List<Integer> squares = numbers.parallelStream()
                .map(n -> n * n)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(squares);
    }
}
```

#### Considerations

- **Order Preservation**: Parallel streams may not preserve the order of elements. Use `forEachOrdered()` if order is important.
- **Performance**: Parallel streams are beneficial for CPU-bound tasks with large data sets. For small data sets, the overhead may outweigh the benefits.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure that operations on shared resources are thread-safe.

### Concurrency Utilities

#### Overview

The `java.util.concurrent` package provides a rich set of utilities for concurrent programming, including thread pools, locks, and atomic variables.

#### Key Classes

- **ExecutorService**: A framework for managing and controlling thread execution.
- **CountDownLatch**: A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations are completed.
- **CyclicBarrier**: A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.

#### Example: Using ExecutorService

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Executing task " + taskId + " by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executor.shutdownNow();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
        }
    }
}
```

### Challenges in Parallel Processing

#### Thread Synchronization

Synchronization is crucial in parallel processing to ensure that multiple threads can safely access shared resources. Java provides several mechanisms for synchronization, including:

- **Synchronized Blocks**: Use synchronized blocks or methods to control access to shared resources.
- **Locks**: Use `ReentrantLock` for more flexible locking mechanisms.

#### Avoiding Race Conditions

Race conditions occur when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, leading to inconsistent results. To avoid race conditions:

- **Use Atomic Variables**: Use classes like `AtomicInteger` for atomic operations.
- **Minimize Shared State**: Reduce the need for shared mutable state.

#### Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. To prevent deadlocks:

- **Lock Ordering**: Always acquire locks in a consistent order.
- **Timeouts**: Use timeouts when acquiring locks to detect and recover from deadlocks.

### Distributed Computing with Apache Ignite

- **Consider Scalability**: Design applications to scale with the number of available processors.
- **Balance Load**: Distribute tasks evenly across threads to avoid bottlenecks.
