## 13.3 Decorator in `functools` Module

In the realm of Python programming, decorators offer a powerful mechanism to modify or enhance functions and methods. The `functools` module, a part of Python's standard library, provides a suite of utilities that support the creation and management of decorators. This section delves into the Decorator design pattern, its implementation in Python, and how `functools` can be leveraged to create efficient, maintainable code.

### Introduction to the Decorator Pattern

The Decorator design pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful for adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Intent of the Decorator Pattern:**
- **Enhancement**: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Flexibility**: Enable flexible code that can be easily extended.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate the core functionality of a class from its auxiliary features.

By using decorators, we can wrap objects with additional functionality without altering the original object. This promotes clean, modular code and allows for easy maintenance and scalability.

### Function Decorators in Python

In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or method. They are applied using the `@` syntax, which is placed above the function definition.

**What are Function Decorators?**
- **Function decorators** are higher-order functions that take another function as an argument and extend or alter its behavior.
- The `@decorator_name` syntax is a syntactic sugar for `function = decorator_name(function)`.

**Simple Example of a Function Decorator:**

```python
def simple_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function call")
        func()
        print("After the function call")
    return wrapper

@simple_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

**Output:**
```
Before the function call
Hello!
After the function call
```

In this example, `simple_decorator` is a decorator that adds behavior before and after the execution of `say_hello`.

### The `functools` Module

The `functools` module in Python provides higher-order functions that act on or return other functions. It is particularly useful for decorators, offering utilities that simplify their implementation and enhance their functionality.

**Key Functions in `functools`:**
- **`functools.wraps`**: A decorator for updating the wrapper function to look like the wrapped function.
- **`functools.lru_cache`**: A decorator for caching the results of function calls.
- **`functools.partial`**: Allows partial application of a function, fixing some portion of the arguments.

### Using `functools.wraps`

When creating decorators, it's important to preserve the original function's metadata, such as its name, docstring, and module. This is where `functools.wraps` comes into play.

**Purpose of `functools.wraps`:**
- **Preservation**: Maintains the original function's metadata.
- **Clarity**: Ensures that the decorated function retains its original identity.

**Example Using `functools.wraps`:**

```python
from functools import wraps

def simple_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before the function call")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After the function call")
        return result
    return wrapper

@simple_decorator
def say_hello(name):
    """Greets the person by name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

say_hello("Alice")
print(say_hello.__name__)  # Outputs: say_hello
print(say_hello.__doc__)   # Outputs: Greets the person by name.
```

Without `@wraps`, the `say_hello` function would lose its original name and docstring, which can lead to confusion and issues in documentation and debugging.

### Built-in Decorators in Python

Python provides several built-in decorators that modify the behavior of methods within classes. These include `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@property`.

**`@staticmethod`**:
- Used to define a method that does not require access to the instance or class.
- Example:

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("This is a static method.")

MyClass.static_method()
```

**`@classmethod`**:
- Used to define a method that receives the class as the first argument.
- Example:

```python
class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"This is a class method of {cls}.")

MyClass.class_method()
```

**`@property`**:
- Used to define a method that acts like an attribute.
- Example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value

    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        self._value = new_value

obj = MyClass(10)
print(obj.value)  # Outputs: 10
obj.value = 20
print(obj.value)  # Outputs: 20
```

### Creating Custom Decorators

Creating custom decorators allows you to encapsulate reusable functionality and apply it across multiple functions or methods.

**Steps to Create a Custom Decorator:**
1. Define a function that takes another function as an argument.
2. Define an inner function (the wrapper) that adds the desired behavior.
3. Return the inner function.

**Example: Logging Execution Time:**

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def log_execution_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executed {func.__name__} in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution_time
def compute_square(n):
    return n * n

compute_square(10)
```

**Example: Checking User Permissions:**

```python
def requires_permission(permission):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(user, *args, **kwargs):
            if user.has_permission(permission):
                return func(user, *args, **kwargs)
            else:
                raise PermissionError(f"User lacks {permission} permission")
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@requires_permission("admin")
def delete_user(user, user_id):
    print(f"User {user_id} deleted by {user.name}")

```

### Stateful Decorators with Classes

Sometimes, decorators need to maintain state across multiple invocations. In such cases, class-based decorators can be used.

**Creating a Class-Based Decorator:**

```python
class CountCalls:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
        self.count = 0

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.count += 1
        print(f"Call {self.count} of {self.func.__name__}")
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)

@CountCalls
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

say_hello("Alice")
say_hello("Bob")
```

In this example, the `CountCalls` class keeps track of how many times the decorated function is called.

### Chaining Decorators

Decorators can be chained, meaning multiple decorators can be applied to a single function. The order in which decorators are applied is important, as it affects the final behavior.

**Example of Chaining Decorators:**

```python
def decorator_one(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator One")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

def decorator_two(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator Two")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@decorator_one
@decorator_two
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

**Output:**
```
Decorator One
Decorator Two
Hello, Alice!
```

In this example, `decorator_one` is applied first, followed by `decorator_two`.

### Decorator Applications

Decorators have a wide range of applications in real-world scenarios. Some common uses include:

- **Memoization**: Caching the results of expensive function calls using `functools.lru_cache`.
- **Synchronization**: Ensuring thread safety using synchronization primitives like `threading.Lock`.

**Example of Memoization:**

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(100))
```

### Best Practices

When using decorators, it's important to follow best practices to ensure code remains clean and maintainable.

**Best Practices for Decorators:**
- **Transparency**: Decorators should not obscure the original function's behavior.
- **Documentation**: Clearly document what the decorator does and any side effects.
- **Readability**: Keep the decorator's logic simple and easy to understand.

### Limitations and Considerations

While decorators are powerful, they can also introduce complexity and potential issues.

**Potential Issues with Decorators:**
- **Debugging**: Decorated functions can be harder to debug due to the added layer of abstraction.
- **Stack Traces**: Decorators can affect stack traces, making it harder to trace errors.

To mitigate these issues, use tools like debuggers and logging to gain insights into the decorated functions' behavior.

### Conclusion

Decorators in Python, especially those supported by the `functools` module, are a versatile tool for enhancing and modifying functions and methods. By understanding and applying the Decorator design pattern, developers can write more flexible, maintainable, and scalable code. As you continue to explore Python, consider how decorators can be used to simplify your code and enhance its functionality.
