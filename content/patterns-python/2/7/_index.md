## 2.7 GRASP Principles

### Introduction to GRASP Principles

In the realm of object-oriented design, understanding how to assign responsibilities to various classes and objects is crucial for building maintainable and scalable software. This is where GRASP, or General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns, comes into play. GRASP provides a set of guidelines to help developers make informed decisions about responsibility assignment, ensuring that the software architecture remains robust and flexible.

GRASP principles are not design patterns themselves but rather a set of guidelines that complement design patterns and SOLID principles. By applying GRASP principles, developers can create systems that are easier to understand, extend, and maintain.

In this section, we will delve into each of the nine GRASP principles, exploring their definitions, the problems they address, guidelines for their application, and practical examples in Python. We will also discuss how these principles work in harmony with design patterns and SOLID principles to enhance object-oriented design.

### 2.7.1 Information Expert

#### Definition
The Information Expert principle suggests that responsibility for a task should be assigned to the class that has the necessary information to fulfill that responsibility.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the challenge of determining which class should be responsible for a particular operation or behavior. By assigning responsibilities based on information, you ensure that the class with the most relevant data handles the task, leading to more cohesive and maintainable code.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Identify the information required to perform a task.
- Assign the responsibility to the class that holds this information.
- Ensure that the class has the necessary methods to manipulate and provide access to this information.

#### Python Example

```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

    def calculate_total(self):
        return sum(item.price for item in self.items)

class Item:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

items = [Item('Book', 12.99), Item('Pen', 1.99)]
order = Order(items)
print(order.calculate_total())  # Output: 14.98
```

In this example, the `Order` class is the information expert because it has access to the list of items and their prices, making it the best candidate to calculate the total order price.

### 2.7.2 Creator

#### Definition
The Creator principle assigns the responsibility of creating an instance of a class to a class that has the necessary information to initialize it or is closely related to it.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the issue of determining which class should be responsible for creating instances of another class. By following the Creator principle, you can ensure that object creation is logically connected to the classes that use or aggregate them.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Assign the creation responsibility to a class that aggregates, contains, or closely uses the created class.
- Ensure that the creating class has sufficient information to initialize the new instance.

#### Python Example

```python
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.orders = []

    def create_order(self, items):
        order = Order(items)
        self.orders.append(order)
        return order

class Order:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

customer = Customer('Alice')
order = customer.create_order([Item('Notebook', 5.99), Item('Pencil', 0.99)])
```

Here, the `Customer` class is responsible for creating `Order` instances because it aggregates orders and has the necessary context to initialize them.

### 2.7.3 Controller

#### Definition
The Controller principle suggests assigning the responsibility of handling a system event to a class that represents the overall system or a use-case scenario.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the need to manage system events and delegate work to other classes. It helps in organizing the flow of control in a system, ensuring that events are handled efficiently and logically.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Identify system events that need handling.
- Assign the responsibility to a class that represents the system or a specific use-case.
- Ensure that the controller delegates tasks to other classes rather than performing them itself.

#### Python Example

```python
class OrderController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = []

    def place_order(self, customer, items):
        order = customer.create_order(items)
        self.orders.append(order)
        self.notify_customer(customer, order)

    def notify_customer(self, customer, order):
        print(f"Notification sent to {customer.name} for order with {len(order.items)} items.")

customer = Customer('Bob')
controller = OrderController()
controller.place_order(customer, [Item('Laptop', 999.99)])
```

In this example, `OrderController` acts as a controller, managing the process of placing an order and notifying the customer.

### 2.7.4 Low Coupling

#### Definition
Low Coupling aims to reduce the dependencies between classes, making the system more modular and flexible.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the challenge of creating a system where changes in one class do not heavily impact others. By minimizing dependencies, you can enhance the system's maintainability and reusability.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Identify and minimize dependencies between classes.
- Use interfaces or abstract classes to decouple implementations.
- Favor composition over inheritance to achieve flexibility.

#### Python Example

```python
class EmailService:
    def send_email(self, recipient, message):
        print(f"Sending email to {recipient}: {message}")

class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, email_service):
        self.email_service = email_service

    def notify(self, recipient, message):
        self.email_service.send_email(recipient, message)

email_service = EmailService()
notification_service = NotificationService(email_service)
notification_service.notify('alice@example.com', 'Your order has been shipped.')
```

Here, `NotificationService` depends on `EmailService` through composition, allowing for easy substitution or extension of the email sending functionality.

### 2.7.5 High Cohesion

#### Definition
High Cohesion focuses on ensuring that a class is focused on a single responsibility or closely related responsibilities.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the issue of classes that try to do too much, leading to complex and difficult-to-maintain code. By ensuring high cohesion, you create classes that are easier to understand and modify.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Ensure that each class has a clear and focused responsibility.
- Avoid adding unrelated functionalities to a single class.
- Refactor classes that have low cohesion into smaller, more focused classes.

#### Python Example

```python
class OrderProcessor:
    def process_order(self, order):
        self.validate_order(order)
        self.calculate_total(order)
        self.complete_order(order)

    def validate_order(self, order):
        print("Validating order...")

    def calculate_total(self, order):
        print("Calculating total...")

    def complete_order(self, order):
        print("Completing order...")

order_processor = OrderProcessor()
order_processor.process_order(order)
```

In this example, `OrderProcessor` has a cohesive set of responsibilities related to processing an order, making it easier to understand and maintain.

### 2.7.6 Polymorphism

#### Definition
Polymorphism allows for the use of a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the need to handle variations in behavior without using conditional logic. By leveraging polymorphism, you can create flexible and extensible systems.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Define a common interface or abstract class for related behaviors.
- Implement different behaviors in subclasses.
- Use polymorphic methods to handle variations without conditionals.

#### Python Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):
        pass

class CreditCardPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paying {amount} using Credit Card.")

class PayPalPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paying {amount} using PayPal.")

def process_payment(payment_method, amount):
    payment_method.pay(amount)

credit_card = CreditCardPayment()
paypal = PayPalPayment()

process_payment(credit_card, 100)
process_payment(paypal, 200)
```

In this example, `PaymentMethod` provides a common interface, and different payment methods implement their specific behavior, allowing for polymorphic payment processing.

### 2.7.7 Pure Fabrication

#### Definition
Pure Fabrication involves creating a class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain to achieve low coupling and high cohesion.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the need for additional classes that do not naturally fit into the problem domain but are necessary for design purposes, such as improving reusability or reducing coupling.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Identify functionalities that do not fit well into existing domain classes.
- Create a new class to handle these responsibilities.
- Ensure that the new class improves the overall design by reducing coupling or increasing cohesion.

#### Python Example

```python
class Logger:
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"Log: {message}")

class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self, logger):
        self.logger = logger

    def process_order(self, order):
        self.logger.log("Processing order...")
        # Order processing logic

logger = Logger()
order_processor = OrderProcessor(logger)
order_processor.process_order(order)
```

Here, `Logger` is a pure fabrication that provides logging functionality, improving the design by separating logging concerns from order processing.

### 2.7.8 Indirection

#### Definition
Indirection introduces an intermediary to reduce direct coupling between classes.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the challenge of tightly coupled classes by introducing an intermediary that manages the interaction, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Identify tightly coupled classes that can benefit from an intermediary.
- Introduce a new class or method to manage the interaction.
- Ensure that the intermediary reduces direct dependencies between classes.

#### Python Example

```python
class Database:
    def query(self, sql):
        print(f"Executing query: {sql}")

class DataAccess:
    def __init__(self, database):
        self.database = database

    def get_data(self, table):
        self.database.query(f"SELECT * FROM {table}")

database = Database()
data_access = DataAccess(database)
data_access.get_data('users')
```

In this example, `DataAccess` acts as an intermediary between the client code and the `Database`, reducing direct coupling.

### 2.7.9 Protected Variations

#### Definition
Protected Variations involves designing a system to protect elements from the variations in other elements.

#### Problem Addressed
This principle addresses the need to shield parts of a system from changes in other parts, reducing the impact of changes and enhancing stability.

#### Guidelines for Application
- Identify points of variation in the system.
- Use interfaces, abstract classes, or design patterns to encapsulate variations.
- Ensure that changes in one part do not propagate to others.

#### Python Example

```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, payment_method, amount):
        payment_method.pay(amount)

class PaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):
        pass

class CreditCardPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paying {amount} using Credit Card.")

class PayPalPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paying {amount} using PayPal.")

processor = PaymentProcessor()
credit_card = CreditCardPayment()
paypal = PayPalPayment()

processor.process_payment(credit_card, 100)
processor.process_payment(paypal, 200)
```

In this example, the `PaymentProcessor` is protected from variations in payment methods by using a common interface, allowing new payment methods to be added without affecting the processor.

### Complementing Design Patterns and SOLID Principles

GRASP principles complement design patterns and SOLID principles by providing a framework for assigning responsibilities in a way that enhances the overall design. While SOLID principles focus on creating flexible and maintainable code, GRASP principles guide the distribution of responsibilities among classes, ensuring that each class has a clear and logical role.

By integrating GRASP principles with design patterns, developers can create systems that are not only well-structured but also adaptable to change. For example, using the Information Expert principle can help identify the right class for implementing a design pattern, while Low Coupling and High Cohesion ensure that the pattern is applied in a way that enhances the system's modularity.

### Conclusion

GRASP principles are a powerful tool for assigning responsibilities in object-oriented design. By understanding and applying these principles, developers can create systems that are easier to maintain, extend, and understand. As you design your software, consider how GRASP principles can guide your decisions, complementing design patterns and SOLID principles to create robust and flexible architectures.

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive systems. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
