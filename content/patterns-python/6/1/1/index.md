## 6.1.1 Implementing Active Object in Python

The Active Object Pattern is a concurrency design pattern that decouples method invocation from method execution. This allows for asynchronous processing, which is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks are I/O-bound or require parallel execution. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Active Object Pattern in Python using threads and `asyncio`.

### Understanding the Active Object Pattern

The Active Object Pattern involves several components that work together to achieve asynchronous execution:

- **Proxy**: This component exposes methods to the client and enqueues method requests into the activation queue.
- **Method Request**: Encapsulates the method to be executed, its arguments, and a future object to hold the result.
- **Activation Queue**: A thread-safe queue that stores method requests.
- **Scheduler**: A thread that monitors the activation queue, dequeues method requests, and executes them using the servant.
- **Servant**: Contains the actual business logic to be executed.
- **Future**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

Let's dive into the implementation of each component in Python.

#### 1. Proxy

The Proxy class exposes the methods of the Servant and enqueues method requests into the activation queue. It returns a Future object that will eventually hold the result of the computation.

```python
import queue
import threading
from concurrent.futures import Future

class Proxy:
    def __init__(self, servant, activation_queue):
        self.servant = servant
        self.activation_queue = activation_queue

    def request_method(self, *args):
        future = Future()
        method_request = MethodRequest(self.servant, args, future)
        self.activation_queue.put(method_request)
        return future
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `Proxy` class takes a `servant` and an `activation_queue` as arguments.
- The `request_method` enqueues a `MethodRequest` into the `activation_queue` and returns a `Future`.

#### 2. Method Request

The Method Request class encapsulates the method to be executed, its arguments, and the future object.

```python
class MethodRequest:
    def __init__(self, servant, args, future):
        self.servant = servant
        self.args = args
        self.future = future

    def execute(self):
        try:
            result = self.servant.perform_task(*self.args)
            self.future.set_result(result)
        except Exception as e:
            self.future.set_exception(e)
```

**Explanation**:
- The `MethodRequest` class stores the `servant`, `args`, and `future`.
- The `execute` method calls the servant's `perform_task` and sets the result in the `future`.

#### 3. Activation Queue

The Activation Queue uses `queue.Queue` for thread-safe request storage.

```python
class ActivationQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = queue.Queue()

    def put(self, method_request):
        self.queue.put(method_request)

    def take(self):
        return self.queue.get()
```

**Explanation**:
- The `ActivationQueue` class wraps a `queue.Queue` to store method requests.
- The `put` and `take` methods add and remove requests from the queue.

#### 4. Scheduler

The Scheduler continuously monitors the Activation Queue and executes method requests.

```python
class Scheduler(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, activation_queue):
        super().__init__()
        self.activation_queue = activation_queue
        self.daemon = True

    def run(self):
        while True:
            method_request = self.activation_queue.take()
            method_request.execute()
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Scheduler` class extends `threading.Thread` and runs as a daemon thread.
- It continuously dequeues and executes method requests.

#### 5. Servant

The Servant contains the actual business logic.

```python
class Servant:
    def perform_task(self, data):
        # Simulate a time-consuming task
        import time
        time.sleep(2)
        return f"Processed {data}"
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Servant` class has a `perform_task` method that simulates a time-consuming operation.

#### 6. Future

The Future object is used to hold the result of the asynchronous computation.

```python
```

**Explanation**:
- We use `concurrent.futures.Future` to represent the result of the computation.

### Putting It All Together

Let's see how all these components work together in a complete example.

```python
def main():
    servant = Servant()
    activation_queue = ActivationQueue()
    proxy = Proxy(servant, activation_queue)
    scheduler = Scheduler(activation_queue)
    scheduler.start()

    # Make asynchronous requests
    future1 = proxy.request_method("Task 1")
    future2 = proxy.request_method("Task 2")

    # Wait for results
    print(future1.result())
    print(future2.result())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation**:
- We create instances of `Servant`, `ActivationQueue`, `Proxy`, and `Scheduler`.
- We start the scheduler and make asynchronous requests through the proxy.
- We wait for and print the results of the futures.

### Synchronization and Thread Safety

In concurrent programming, synchronization is crucial to prevent race conditions. The Active Object Pattern uses thread-safe data structures like `queue.Queue` to ensure that method requests are safely enqueued and dequeued. Additionally, the `Future` object is thread-safe, allowing safe access to the result of the computation.

### Performance Considerations

While threading introduces some overhead, it allows for parallel execution of tasks, which can significantly improve performance for I/O-bound operations. However, for CPU-bound tasks, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython can limit the effectiveness of threading. In such cases, using `asyncio` for asynchronous I/O operations might be more efficient.

### Real-World Example: Asynchronous Task Executor

Let's implement a sample application that uses the Active Object Pattern to execute tasks asynchronously.

```python
import random

class TaskExecutorServant:
    def execute_task(self, task_id):
        import time
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 2.0))
        return f"Task {task_id} completed."

def task_executor_example():
    servant = TaskExecutorServant()
    activation_queue = ActivationQueue()
    proxy = Proxy(servant, activation_queue)
    scheduler = Scheduler(activation_queue)
    scheduler.start()

    futures = [proxy.request_method(i) for i in range(5)]

    for future in futures:
        print(future.result())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    task_executor_example()
```

**Explanation**:
- The `TaskExecutorServant` simulates task execution with random delays.
- We create multiple asynchronous requests and print their results as they complete.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by modifying the `perform_task` method in the `Servant` class to simulate different types of tasks. You can also try implementing the Active Object Pattern using `asyncio` for I/O-bound operations.

### Visualizing the Active Object Pattern

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between components in the Active Object Pattern.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy
    participant ActivationQueue
    participant Scheduler
    participant Servant
    participant Future

    Client->>Proxy: request_method()
    Proxy->>ActivationQueue: put(MethodRequest)
    ActivationQueue->>Scheduler: take()
    Scheduler->>Servant: perform_task()
    Servant-->>Scheduler: result
    Scheduler->>Future: set_result()
    Future-->>Client: result
```

**Diagram Description**: The sequence diagram shows how a client request is handled by the proxy, enqueued in the activation queue, processed by the scheduler, executed by the servant, and the result is set in the future.
