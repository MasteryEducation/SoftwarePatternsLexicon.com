## 4.1.2 Class vs. Object Adapters

In the realm of software design patterns, the Adapter Pattern plays a crucial role in enabling incompatible interfaces to work together. This is particularly useful when integrating third-party libraries or legacy code with new systems. In Python, adapters can be implemented using two primary approaches: class adapters and object adapters. Each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and understanding these can help you choose the right one for your specific needs.

### Understanding Class Adapters

Class adapters leverage inheritance to adapt one interface to another. By subclassing the target class and the adaptee, a class adapter can override methods and provide the desired interface to the client.

#### Implementing Class Adapters in Python

Let's consider a scenario where we have a `EuropeanSocket` class that provides electricity in volts, and we need to adapt it to a `USASocket` interface that expects electricity in a different voltage.

```python
class EuropeanSocket:
    def voltage(self):
        return 230

class USASocket:
    def voltage(self):
        pass

class SocketAdapter(EuropeanSocket, USASocket):
    def voltage(self):
        # Convert the voltage from European to USA standard
        return 110

def power_device(socket: USASocket):
    print(f"Device powered with {socket.voltage()} volts")

european_socket = SocketAdapter()
power_device(european_socket)
```

In this example, `SocketAdapter` inherits from both `EuropeanSocket` and `USASocket`, allowing it to override the `voltage` method to provide the correct voltage for a `USASocket`.

#### Advantages of Class Adapters

1. **Simplicity**: Class adapters are straightforward to implement when the target and adaptee interfaces are similar.
2. **Performance**: Since class adapters use inheritance, they can be more efficient than object adapters, which rely on composition.
3. **Direct Access**: Class adapters have direct access to the adaptee's protected members, which can be useful in certain scenarios.

#### Disadvantages of Class Adapters

1. **Single Inheritance Limitation**: Python's single inheritance model can limit the use of class adapters, especially when the adaptee is already part of another inheritance hierarchy.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Class adapters create a tight coupling between the adapter and the adaptee, making it harder to change the adaptee without affecting the adapter.
3. **Lack of Flexibility**: Class adapters are less flexible than object adapters, as they cannot adapt multiple adaptees at runtime.

### Understanding Object Adapters

Object adapters use composition to adapt one interface to another. Instead of inheriting from the adaptee, an object adapter holds a reference to an instance of the adaptee and delegates calls to it.

#### Implementing Object Adapters in Python

Let's revisit the socket example, but this time using an object adapter.

```python
class EuropeanSocket:
    def voltage(self):
        return 230

class USASocket:
    def voltage(self):
        pass

class SocketAdapter(USASocket):
    def __init__(self, european_socket: EuropeanSocket):
        self.european_socket = european_socket

    def voltage(self):
        # Convert the voltage from European to USA standard
        return 110

def power_device(socket: USASocket):
    print(f"Device powered with {socket.voltage()} volts")

european_socket = EuropeanSocket()
adapter = SocketAdapter(european_socket)
power_device(adapter)
```

In this example, `SocketAdapter` holds a reference to an instance of `EuropeanSocket` and delegates the `voltage` method call to it, converting the voltage as needed.

#### Advantages of Object Adapters

1. **Flexibility**: Object adapters can adapt multiple adaptees at runtime, providing greater flexibility.
2. **Loose Coupling**: By using composition, object adapters maintain a loose coupling between the adapter and the adaptee, making it easier to change the adaptee without affecting the adapter.
3. **Multiple Adaptees**: Object adapters can work with multiple adaptees simultaneously, which is not possible with class adapters.

#### Disadvantages of Object Adapters

1. **Complexity**: Object adapters can be more complex to implement than class adapters, especially when dealing with multiple adaptees.
2. **Performance Overhead**: The use of composition can introduce a slight performance overhead compared to inheritance.

### Comparing Class and Object Adapters

To better understand the differences between class and object adapters, let's compare them side by side:

| Feature                | Class Adapter                          | Object Adapter                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Implementation**     | Inheritance                            | Composition                             |
| **Flexibility**        | Less flexible                          | More flexible                           |
| **Coupling**           | Tight coupling                         | Loose coupling                          |
| **Multiple Adaptees**  | Not supported                          | Supported                               |
| **Performance**        | Generally faster                       | Slight overhead due to composition      |
| **Complexity**         | Simpler implementation                 | More complex implementation             |

### When to Choose Class vs. Object Adapters

The choice between class and object adapters depends on the specific requirements of your application:

- **Use Class Adapters** when:
  - You need a simple and efficient solution.
  - The adaptee and target interfaces are similar.
  - You are not constrained by Python's single inheritance limitation.

- **Use Object Adapters** when:
  - You need flexibility to adapt multiple adaptees.
  - You want to maintain loose coupling between the adapter and the adaptee.
  - You need to adapt an existing class hierarchy without modifying it.

### Guidelines for Implementing Adapters in Python

1. **Identify the Target Interface**: Clearly define the interface that the client expects to interact with.
2. **Analyze the Adaptee**: Understand the existing interface that needs to be adapted.
3. **Choose the Adapter Type**: Decide whether a class or object adapter is more suitable based on the requirements.
4. **Implement the Adapter**: Write the adapter class, ensuring it implements the target interface and delegates calls to the adaptee.
5. **Test the Adapter**: Verify that the adapter correctly translates calls between the client and the adaptee.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of class and object adapters, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Experiment with Class Adapters**: Change the `SocketAdapter` class to adapt additional methods from `EuropeanSocket`.
- **Explore Object Adapters**: Modify the `SocketAdapter` to handle multiple `EuropeanSocket` instances simultaneously.
- **Performance Testing**: Compare the performance of class and object adapters in a scenario with high-frequency method calls.

### Visualizing Class vs. Object Adapters

To further illustrate the differences between class and object adapters, let's visualize their structures using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Class Adapter Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class EuropeanSocket {
        +voltage() int
    }
    class USASocket {
        +voltage() int
    }
    class SocketAdapter {
        +voltage() int
    }
    SocketAdapter --|> EuropeanSocket
    SocketAdapter --|> USASocket
```

*This diagram shows how `SocketAdapter` inherits from both `EuropeanSocket` and `USASocket`, allowing it to override methods and provide the desired interface.*

#### Object Adapter Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class EuropeanSocket {
        +voltage() int
    }
    class USASocket {
        +voltage() int
    }
    class SocketAdapter {
        -european_socket: EuropeanSocket
        +voltage() int
    }
    SocketAdapter --> EuropeanSocket
    SocketAdapter --|> USASocket
```

*This diagram illustrates how `SocketAdapter` holds a reference to an instance of `EuropeanSocket` and delegates method calls to it.*
