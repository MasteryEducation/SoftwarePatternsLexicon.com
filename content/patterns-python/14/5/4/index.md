## 14.5.4 Use Cases and Examples

In today's digital landscape, security is paramount. As developers, we must ensure that our applications are robust against potential threats. Security design patterns offer proven solutions to common security challenges, helping us build safer applications. In this section, we'll explore practical use cases where security design patterns have been effectively applied in Python, demonstrating their impact on real-world scenarios.

### Use Case 1: Securing User Authentication and Authorization

**Scenario Summary**:  
A web application needs to manage user authentication and authorization securely. The application must ensure that only authenticated users can access certain resources and that users have the appropriate permissions for their roles.

**Security Challenges Addressed**:
- Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- Ensuring that user credentials are stored and transmitted securely.
- Managing user roles and permissions effectively.

**Design Pattern Implemented**:  
**Authorization and Authentication Patterns**

**Implementation**:
1. **Authentication**: Use the Strategy Pattern to implement multiple authentication strategies (e.g., OAuth, JWT, and basic authentication). This allows the application to switch between different authentication mechanisms without altering the core logic.

    ```python
    class AuthenticationStrategy:
        def authenticate(self, request):
            raise NotImplementedError("Authenticate method not implemented.")

    class OAuthStrategy(AuthenticationStrategy):
        def authenticate(self, request):
            # Implement OAuth authentication logic
            pass

    class JWTStrategy(AuthenticationStrategy):
        def authenticate(self, request):
            # Implement JWT authentication logic
            pass

    class Authenticator:
        def __init__(self, strategy: AuthenticationStrategy):
            self._strategy = strategy

        def authenticate(self, request):
            return self._strategy.authenticate(request)
    ```

2. **Authorization**: Implement the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) pattern to manage user roles and permissions. This ensures that users can only perform actions that their roles permit.

    ```python
    class Role:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
            self.permissions = set()

        def add_permission(self, permission):
            self.permissions.add(permission)

    class User:
        def __init__(self, username):
            self.username = username
            self.roles = set()

        def add_role(self, role):
            self.roles.add(role)

        def has_permission(self, permission):
            return any(permission in role.permissions for role in self.roles)
    ```

**Outcomes and Benefits**:
- Enhanced security by separating authentication and authorization concerns.
- Flexibility to adapt to new authentication methods without major code changes.

    class SensitiveData:
        def get_data(self):
            # Return sensitive data
            return "Sensitive Data"

    class SecureProxy:
        def __init__(self, sensitive_data: SensitiveData, user):
            self._sensitive_data = sensitive_data
            self._user = user

        def get_data(self):
            if self._user.has_permission("access_sensitive_data"):
                self._log_access()
                return self._sensitive_data.get_data()
            else:
                raise PermissionError("Access denied.")

        def _log_access(self):
            # Log the access attempt
            print(f"User {self._user.username} accessed sensitive data.")
    ```

**Outcomes and Benefits**:

    ```python
    import threading

    class ConfigurationManager:
        _instance = None
        _lock = threading.Lock()

        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            if not cls._instance:
                with cls._lock:
                    if not cls._instance:
                        cls._instance = super().__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
            return cls._instance

        def __init__(self):
            # Initialize configuration settings
            pass
    ```

**Outcomes and Benefits**:

    ```python
    class ApiService:
        def get_data(self):
            return "API Data"

    class ApiProxy:
        def __init__(self, api_service: ApiService, user):
            self._api_service = api_service
            self._user = user

        def get_data(self):
            if self._authenticate_request() and self._authorize_request():
                self._log_request()
                return self._api_service.get_data()
            else:
                raise PermissionError("Access denied.")

        def _authenticate_request(self):
            # Implement authentication logic
            return self._user.is_authenticated()

        def _authorize_request(self):
            # Implement authorization logic
            return self._user.has_permission("access_api")

        def _log_request(self):
            # Log the API request
            print(f"User {self._user.username} accessed API data.")
    ```

                        cls._instance = super().__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
            return cls._instance

        def __init__(self):
            self._config = self._load_config()

        def _load_config(self):
            # Load configuration from file
            return {"setting": "value"}

        def update_config(self, key, value):
            self._config[key] = value
            self._log_change(key, value)

        def _log_change(self, key, value):
