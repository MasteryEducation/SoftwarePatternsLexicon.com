## 3.4 Builder Pattern

In the realm of software design, creating complex objects can often lead to convoluted and hard-to-maintain code. The Builder Pattern offers a solution by separating the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects that require numerous optional parameters or intricate configurations.

### Understanding the Problem

When constructing objects with multiple attributes, especially those with optional parameters, the code can become cumbersome and error-prone. Consider a scenario where you need to create a `House` object with attributes like `windows`, `doors`, `roofType`, `hasGarage`, `hasSwimmingPool`, and more. Using a simple constructor with numerous parameters can lead to confusion and potential errors, especially when many parameters are optional or have default values.

### The Builder Pattern Solution

The Builder Pattern addresses this issue by providing a way to construct a complex object step by step. It allows for greater control over the construction process, enabling you to create different representations of an object using the same construction code.

#### Key Components of the Builder Pattern

1. **Builder Interface**: Defines the steps required to build the product.
2. **Concrete Builder**: Implements the builder interface and constructs the product's parts.
3. **Director**: Constructs an object using the builder interface.
4. **Product**: The complex object being built.

### Class Diagram

To better understand the Builder Pattern, let's visualize its structure using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Director {
        +construct()
    }
    class Builder {
        +buildPartA()
        +buildPartB()
        +getResult()
    }
    class ConcreteBuilder {
        +buildPartA()
        +buildPartB()
        +getResult()
    }
    class Product {
        +partA
        +partB
    }
    Director --> Builder
    Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder
    ConcreteBuilder --> Product
```

### Implementing the Builder Pattern in Python

Let's implement the Builder Pattern in Python with a practical example of constructing a `House` object.

```python
class House:
    def __init__(self):
        self.windows = None
        self.doors = None
        self.roof_type = None
        self.has_garage = False
        self.has_swimming_pool = False

    def __str__(self):
        return (f"House with {self.windows} windows, {self.doors} doors, "
                f"roof type: {self.roof_type}, "
                f"garage: {'Yes' if self.has_garage else 'No'}, "
                f"swimming pool: {'Yes' if self.has_swimming_pool else 'No'}")


class HouseBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.house = House()

    def set_windows(self, windows):
        self.house.windows = windows
        return self

    def set_doors(self, doors):
        self.house.doors = doors
        return self

    def set_roof_type(self, roof_type):
        self.house.roof_type = roof_type
        return self

    def add_garage(self):
        self.house.has_garage = True
        return self

    def add_swimming_pool(self):
        self.house.has_swimming_pool = True
        return self

    def build(self):
        return self.house


class Director:
    def __init__(self, builder):
        self.builder = builder

    def construct_simple_house(self):
        return self.builder.set_windows(4).set_doors(2).set_roof_type("Gable").build()

    def construct_luxury_house(self):
        return (self.builder.set_windows(10)
                .set_doors(5)
                .set_roof_type("Hip")
                .add_garage()
                .add_swimming_pool()
                .build())


builder = HouseBuilder()
director = Director(builder)

simple_house = director.construct_simple_house()
print(simple_house)

luxury_house = director.construct_luxury_house()
print(luxury_house)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **House Class**: Represents the product being built. It has attributes for windows, doors, roof type, and optional features like a garage and swimming pool.
- **HouseBuilder Class**: Implements the builder interface. It provides methods to set various attributes of the `House` object and returns `self` to allow method chaining (Fluent Interface style).
- **Director Class**: Uses the builder to construct different types of houses. It defines methods like `construct_simple_house` and `construct_luxury_house` to build specific configurations.
- **Fluent Interface**: The builder methods return `self`, enabling method chaining, which improves code readability and allows for a more intuitive construction process.

### Builder vs. Factory Patterns

While both Builder and Factory patterns are creational patterns, they serve different purposes:

- **Factory Pattern**: Focuses on creating objects without exposing the instantiation logic. It is best suited for scenarios where the creation logic is simple and the object can be created in one step.
- **Builder Pattern**: Ideal for constructing complex objects step by step. It provides more control over the construction process and is suitable for objects with numerous optional parameters or configurations.

### Improving Code Readability and Maintenance

The Builder Pattern enhances code readability by clearly separating the construction logic from the representation. It allows developers to construct complex objects in a controlled manner, reducing the likelihood of errors and making the codebase easier to maintain.

### Fluent Interface Style

The Fluent Interface style, used in our `HouseBuilder` example, allows for a more natural and readable way of constructing objects. By returning `self` from each method, we can chain method calls, leading to cleaner and more expressive code.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by adding new features to the `House` class, such as `hasGarden` or `hasBasement`. Modify the `HouseBuilder` class to include methods for these new features and update the `Director` class to construct houses with these additional features.

### Visualizing the Builder Pattern in Action

To further illustrate how the Builder Pattern works, let's visualize the process of constructing a house using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Director
    participant Builder
    participant House

    Client->>Director: construct_luxury_house()
    Director->>Builder: set_windows(10)
    Builder->>House: set windows
    Builder-->>Director: return self
    Director->>Builder: set_doors(5)
    Builder->>House: set doors
    Builder-->>Director: return self
    Director->>Builder: set_roof_type("Hip")
    Builder->>House: set roof type
    Builder-->>Director: return self
    Director->>Builder: add_garage()
    Builder->>House: add garage
    Builder-->>Director: return self
    Director->>Builder: add_swimming_pool()
    Builder->>House: add swimming pool
    Builder-->>Director: return self
    Director->>Builder: build()
    Builder->>House: construct house
    Builder-->>Director: return House
    Director-->>Client: return House
```
