## 18.1 Glossary of Terms

Welcome to the Glossary of Terms for "Design Patterns in Python." This section serves as a comprehensive reference for key terminology used throughout the guide. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to design patterns, this glossary will help clarify important concepts and terms related to design patterns, Python programming, and software development. Each term is defined clearly and concisely, with examples provided where applicable. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy navigation.

### A

**Abstraction**  
The process of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. In design patterns, abstraction is often used to separate the interface from the implementation, allowing for more flexible code.

*Example*: In the Bridge pattern, abstraction separates the interface from the implementation, allowing them to vary independently.

**Adapter Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

*Example*: When integrating a third-party library with a different interface, an adapter can be used to convert the library's interface to the one expected by the application.

**Algorithm**  
A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. In programming, algorithms are implemented as functions or methods.

*Example*: The sorting algorithm used in the Strategy pattern allows different sorting strategies to be applied interchangeably.

### B

**Behavioral Patterns**  
Design patterns that focus on communication between objects. They help define how objects interact in a system.

*Example*: The Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern where a subject notifies observers of any state changes.

**Builder Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

*Example*: A `Builder` class constructs a `House` object step-by-step, allowing for different types of houses to be built using the same process.

### C

**Class**  
A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It defines properties and behaviors that the created objects will have.

*Example*: In Python, a class is defined using the `class` keyword, and objects are instances of classes.

**Composition**  
A design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, allowing for more flexible code than inheritance.

*Example*: In the Composite pattern, composition is used to build a tree structure of objects.

**Creational Patterns**  
Design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

*Example*: The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### D

**Decorator Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

*Example*: Python decorators are a syntactic feature that allows functions to be wrapped with additional functionality.

**Dependency Injection**  
A technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, rather than creating them internally. This promotes loose coupling and easier testing.

*Example*: In Python, dependencies can be injected through constructors or setters.

**Design Pattern**  
A general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Design patterns are templates for how to solve problems that can be used in many different situations.

*Example*: The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### E

**Encapsulation**  
The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.

*Example*: In Python, encapsulation is often implemented using private variables and methods.

**Event-Driven Architecture**  
A software architecture pattern promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.

*Example*: In the Observer pattern, events are used to notify observers about changes in the subject's state.

### F

**Facade Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

*Example*: A `Facade` class can provide a simple interface to a complex library, making it easier to use.

**Factory Method Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

*Example*: In a GUI framework, a factory method might be used to create different types of buttons based on the operating system.

**Flyweight Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows for the efficient sharing of large numbers of fine-grained objects.

*Example*: In a text editor, flyweight objects can be used to represent characters, reducing memory usage.

### G

**Gang of Four (GoF)**  
Refers to the authors of the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" which introduced the concept of design patterns in software engineering.

*Example*: The GoF book is a seminal work that describes 23 classic design patterns.

**Generics**  
A feature of programming languages that allows functions and classes to operate with any data type. Python achieves similar functionality through its dynamic typing system.

*Example*: Python's `list` can hold items of any type, demonstrating its generic nature.

### H

**High Cohesion**  
A design principle where a module or class is responsible for a single task or closely related tasks, improving readability and maintainability.

*Example*: In the GRASP principles, high cohesion is emphasized to ensure classes have focused responsibilities.

### I

**Inheritance**  
A mechanism in object-oriented programming where a new class is created from an existing class. The new class, known as a subclass, inherits attributes and behaviors from the existing class, known as a superclass.

*Example*: In Python, inheritance is implemented using the class definition syntax with parentheses.

**Interface**  
A shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. In object-oriented programming, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.

*Example*: In Python, interfaces can be defined using abstract base classes from the `abc` module.

### L

**Lazy Initialization**  
A design pattern that defers the creation of an object until it is needed, which can improve performance and resource utilization.

*Example*: In the Singleton pattern, lazy initialization can be used to create the instance only when it is first accessed.

**Low Coupling**  
A design principle where modules or classes are independent from one another, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.

*Example*: The GRASP principles advocate for low coupling to increase module reuse and flexibility.

### M

**Mediator Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.

*Example*: In a chat application, a mediator can handle communication between users, reducing direct dependencies.

**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**  
An architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

*Example*: In web applications, MVC is commonly used to separate data handling, user interface, and control logic.

**Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**  
An architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic or back-end logic (the data model).

*Example*: MVVM is often used in modern desktop applications to enable two-way data binding between the view and the view model.

### N

**Null Object Pattern**  
A design pattern that uses an object with defined neutral ("null") behavior to represent the absence of an object instance.

*Example*: Instead of returning `None`, a method might return a `NullObject` that implements the same interface but does nothing.

### O

**Observer Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

*Example*: In a stock market application, the observer pattern can be used to update stock prices in real-time.

**Open/Closed Principle**  
A principle of software design that states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

*Example*: The Strategy pattern adheres to the open/closed principle by allowing algorithms to be added without modifying existing code.

### P

**Polymorphism**  
A concept in programming where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.

*Example*: In Python, polymorphism allows different objects to be passed to the same function, which can call the appropriate method for each object.

**Prototype Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that allows cloning of objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

*Example*: In Python, the `copy` module can be used to implement the prototype pattern by cloning objects.

**Proxy Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object. It acts as an interface to something else.

*Example*: A proxy can be used to control access to a resource, such as a network connection or a large object in memory.

### R

**Refactoring**  
The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. It improves nonfunctional attributes of the software.

*Example*: Applying design patterns during refactoring can improve code structure and clarity.

**Repository Pattern**  
A design pattern that mediates data from and to the domain and data access layers. It is a way to encapsulate the logic required to access data sources.

*Example*: In a Python application, a repository class might handle all database operations for a specific entity.

### S

**Singleton Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance and provides a global point of access to it.

*Example*: The logging module in Python uses the Singleton pattern to ensure only one logger instance is used throughout an application.

**SOLID Principles**  
A set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

*Example*: The Factory Method pattern adheres to the SOLID principles by promoting the open/closed principle.

**Strategy Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

*Example*: In a payment processing system, different payment strategies can be selected based on user preference.

**Structural Patterns**  
Design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

*Example*: The Adapter pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

### T

**Template Method Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

*Example*: In a report generation system, the template method pattern can define the overall structure, while subclasses implement specific report types.

**Thread Safety**  
A concept in programming that ensures that shared data structures are accessed by multiple threads in a way that prevents data corruption.

*Example*: In the Singleton pattern, thread safety ensures that only one instance is created even in a multi-threaded environment.

### U

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)**  
A standardized modeling language used to specify, visualize, develop, and document the artifacts of software systems.

*Example*: UML diagrams are often used to represent design patterns and their interactions.

**Unit Testing**  
A software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit performs as expected.

*Example*: In Python, the `unittest` module provides a framework for writing and running tests.

### V

**Visitor Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

*Example*: In a compiler, the visitor pattern can be used to perform operations on nodes of an abstract syntax tree.

### W

**Wrapper**  
An object or function that encapsulates another object or function to alter or enhance its behavior.

*Example*: In Python, decorators are a form of wrapper that can modify the behavior of functions or methods.

### X

**XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**  
A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

*Example*: XML is often used for configuration files and data interchange between systems.

### Y

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**  
A principle of extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until it is necessary.

*Example*: In software development, adhering to YAGNI helps prevent feature bloat and keeps the codebase manageable.

### Z

**Zero-Cost Abstraction**  
A concept in programming where abstractions are implemented in such a way that they have no runtime overhead compared to hand-written lower-level code.

*Example*: Python's list comprehensions provide a zero-cost abstraction for creating lists in a concise and readable way.
