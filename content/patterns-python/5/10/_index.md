## 5.10 Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's overall structure. It is particularly useful when you want to enforce a consistent algorithm structure across different implementations while allowing specific steps to vary.

### Intent and Motivation

The primary intent of the Template Method Pattern is to provide a framework for an algorithm, where the invariant parts are defined in a base class, and the variant parts are implemented in derived classes. This separation of concerns allows for code reuse and flexibility, as the algorithm's structure is controlled by the base class, while specific steps can be customized by subclasses.

#### Key Motivations:
- **Control Over Algorithm Structure**: By defining the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, you ensure that the overall structure remains consistent across different implementations.
- **Flexibility in Specific Steps**: Subclasses can override specific steps of the algorithm, providing flexibility and customization without altering the core structure.
- **Code Reuse**: Common algorithmic steps are implemented once in the base class, promoting reuse and reducing duplication.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes to the algorithm's structure are centralized in the base class, making maintenance easier and less error-prone.

### Pattern Structure

The Template Method Pattern involves the following components:

1. **Abstract Class**: This class defines the template method and declares abstract primitive operations that subclasses must implement.
2. **Template Method**: A method defined in the abstract class that outlines the algorithm's structure. It calls the primitive operations, some of which are abstract and must be implemented by subclasses.
3. **Concrete Subclasses**: These classes implement the primitive operations to provide specific behavior for the algorithm's steps.

#### Structure Diagram

Below is a Mermaid.js diagram illustrating the structure of the Template Method Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractClass {
        +templateMethod()
        #primitiveOperation1()
        #primitiveOperation2()
    }
    class ConcreteClassA {
        +primitiveOperation1()
        +primitiveOperation2()
    }
    class ConcreteClassB {
        +primitiveOperation1()
        +primitiveOperation2()
    }
    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClassA
    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClassB
```

- **AbstractClass**: Contains the `templateMethod()` and abstract methods `primitiveOperation1()` and `primitiveOperation2()`.
- **ConcreteClassA** and **ConcreteClassB**: Implement the abstract methods to provide specific behavior.

### Python Implementation

Let's implement a Python application that processes data from different sources (e.g., files, databases, web services) using the Template Method Pattern.

#### Abstract Class

We'll start by defining an abstract class `DataProcessor` that outlines the template method `process_data()` and declares abstract methods for specific steps.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DataProcessor(ABC):
    def process_data(self):
        self.load_data()
        self.process()
        self.save_data()

    @abstractmethod
    def load_data(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def process(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def save_data(self):
        pass
```

- **`process_data()`**: The template method that defines the algorithm's structure.
- **`load_data()`, `process()`, `save_data()`**: Abstract methods that subclasses must implement.

#### Concrete Subclasses

Now, let's create concrete subclasses that implement the abstract methods for different data sources.

```python
class FileDataProcessor(DataProcessor):
    def load_data(self):
        print("Loading data from a file.")

    def process(self):
        print("Processing file data.")

    def save_data(self):
        print("Saving processed file data.")

class DatabaseDataProcessor(DataProcessor):
    def load_data(self):
        print("Loading data from a database.")

    def process(self):
        print("Processing database data.")

    def save_data(self):
        print("Saving processed database data.")
```

- **`FileDataProcessor`**: Implements data processing steps for files.
- **`DatabaseDataProcessor`**: Implements data processing steps for databases.

#### Usage Example

Let's see how we can use these classes to process data from different sources.

```python
def main():
    file_processor = FileDataProcessor()
    file_processor.process_data()

    print("\n")

    db_processor = DatabaseDataProcessor()
    db_processor.process_data()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Output:**

```
Loading data from a file.
Processing file data.
Saving processed file data.

Loading data from a database.
Processing database data.
Saving processed database data.
```

### Benefits of the Template Method Pattern

- **Code Reuse**: The invariant parts of the algorithm are implemented once in the base class, promoting reuse and reducing duplication.
- **Consistent Algorithm Structure**: The template method ensures that the algorithm's structure remains consistent across different implementations.
- **Flexibility**: Subclasses can override specific steps, providing flexibility and customization without altering the core structure.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes to the algorithm's structure are centralized in the base class, making maintenance easier and less error-prone.

### Potential Issues

While the Template Method Pattern offers several benefits, it also has potential drawbacks:

- **Restrictive Inheritance Hierarchy**: The pattern relies on inheritance, which can lead to a rigid class hierarchy. Overuse of inheritance can make the design inflexible and difficult to modify.
- **Overuse**: Applying the Template Method Pattern inappropriately can lead to a design that is overly complex and difficult to understand.

### Best Practices

- **Use Abstract Base Classes**: Utilize Python's `abc` module to define abstract base classes, ensuring that subclasses implement the required methods.
- **Document Expected Behavior**: Clearly document the expected behavior of primitive operations to guide subclass implementations.
- **Limit Inheritance Depth**: Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies to maintain flexibility and simplicity in the design.

### Encouraging Application

Consider using the Template Method Pattern when there are invariant parts of an algorithm across various implementations. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to enforce a consistent algorithm structure while allowing specific steps to vary.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by adding new data sources, such as web services or APIs. Implement new subclasses that define the `load_data()`, `process()`, and `save_data()` methods for these sources. This exercise will help you understand how the Template Method Pattern promotes code reuse and flexibility.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

To further illustrate the Template Method Pattern, let's visualize the process flow using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AbstractClass
    participant ConcreteClass

    Client->>AbstractClass: process_data()
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClass: load_data()
    ConcreteClass-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClass: process()
    ConcreteClass-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClass: save_data()
    ConcreteClass-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass-->>Client: return
```

This diagram shows the interaction between the client, the abstract class, and the concrete class during the execution of the template method.

### Knowledge Check

However, it is essential to use this pattern judiciously to avoid a restrictive inheritance hierarchy and overly complex designs. By following best practices and understanding the pattern's benefits and potential issues, you can effectively apply the Template Method Pattern in your Python projects.
