## 5.12.2 Combining Business Rules

In the realm of software development, business rules often dictate the logic that drives the behavior of applications. These rules can range from simple to complex, and as developers, we frequently encounter scenarios where multiple criteria must be evaluated together. This is where the Specification Pattern shines, offering a structured way to combine business rules using logical operations. In this section, we will delve into the need for combining specifications, provide practical examples, discuss the implementation of combinators, and highlight the benefits of this approach.

### Understanding the Need for Combining Specifications

Business applications often require the evaluation of multiple criteria to make decisions. For instance, consider an e-commerce platform where products need to be filtered based on various attributes such as color, size, and price. A customer might want to see products that are red and large, or green and medium. In such cases, combining specifications becomes essential to handle complex queries efficiently.

#### Real-World Scenarios

1. **Product Filtering**: In an online store, customers may want to filter products based on multiple attributes like color, size, and brand. Combining these specifications allows for dynamic and flexible filtering options.

2. **User Permissions**: In a software application, user permissions might be determined by a combination of roles and access levels. Combining specifications can help in evaluating these complex permission rules.

3. **Loan Approval**: In a banking application, loan approval might depend on a combination of criteria such as credit score, income level, and employment status. Specifications can be combined to evaluate these criteria collectively.

### Implementing the Specification Pattern

The Specification Pattern provides a way to encapsulate business rules into reusable components called specifications. These specifications can be combined using logical operations like `and`, `or`, and `not` to form complex rules.

#### Basic Specification Class

Let's start by defining a basic `Specification` class in Python:

```python
class Specification:
    def is_satisfied_by(self, candidate):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses should implement this method.")
```

This class serves as a base for all specifications, requiring subclasses to implement the `is_satisfied_by` method, which evaluates whether a candidate satisfies the specification.

#### Concrete Specifications

Next, we define concrete specifications for specific criteria. For instance, let's create specifications for filtering products based on color and size:

```python
class ColorSpecification(Specification):
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

    def is_satisfied_by(self, product):
        return product.color == self.color

class SizeSpecification(Specification):
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size

    def is_satisfied_by(self, product):
        return product.size == self.size
```

Here, `ColorSpecification` and `SizeSpecification` are concrete implementations that check if a product's color or size matches the specified criteria.

### Combining Specifications with Combinators

To combine specifications, we need to implement logical combinators that allow us to perform `and`, `or`, and `not` operations.

#### Logical AND Combinator

The `AndSpecification` combines two specifications using a logical AND operation:

```python
class AndSpecification(Specification):
    def __init__(self, spec1, spec2):
        self.spec1 = spec1
        self.spec2 = spec2

    def is_satisfied_by(self, candidate):
        return self.spec1.is_satisfied_by(candidate) and self.spec2.is_satisfied_by(candidate)
```

This combinator returns `True` only if both specifications are satisfied by the candidate.

#### Logical OR Combinator

The `OrSpecification` combines two specifications using a logical OR operation:

```python
class OrSpecification(Specification):
    def __init__(self, spec1, spec2):
        self.spec1 = spec1
        self.spec2 = spec2

    def is_satisfied_by(self, candidate):
        return self.spec1.is_satisfied_by(candidate) or self.spec2.is_satisfied_by(candidate)
```

This combinator returns `True` if either of the specifications is satisfied by the candidate.

#### Logical NOT Combinator

The `NotSpecification` negates a specification:

```python
class NotSpecification(Specification):
    def __init__(self, spec):
        self.spec = spec

    def is_satisfied_by(self, candidate):
        return not self.spec.is_satisfied_by(candidate)
```

This combinator returns `True` if the specification is not satisfied by the candidate.

### Practical Examples

Let's see how these specifications can be combined to filter products based on multiple criteria.

#### Example: Filtering Products

Consider a list of products, each with attributes like color and size:

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, color, size):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.size = size

products = [
    Product("Product 1", "red", "large"),
    Product("Product 2", "green", "medium"),
    Product("Product 3", "blue", "small"),
    Product("Product 4", "red", "medium"),
    Product("Product 5", "green", "large"),
]
```

We can now use our specifications to filter products that are red and large:

```python
red_spec = ColorSpecification("red")
large_spec = SizeSpecification("large")
red_and_large_spec = AndSpecification(red_spec, large_spec)

filtered_products = [product for product in products if red_and_large_spec.is_satisfied_by(product)]

for product in filtered_products:
    print(product.name)
```

This code will output:

```
Product 1
```

#### Example: Flexible Queries

The power of the Specification Pattern lies in its flexibility. We can easily modify our query to find products that are either red or large:

```python
red_or_large_spec = OrSpecification(red_spec, large_spec)

filtered_products = [product for product in products if red_or_large_spec.is_satisfied_by(product)]

for product in filtered_products:
    print(product.name)
```

This code will output:

```
Product 1
Product 4
Product 5
```

### Benefits of Combining Specifications

Combining specifications using the Specification Pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Flexibility**: Specifications can be combined in various ways to form complex queries, allowing for dynamic and flexible rule evaluation.

2. **Reusability**: Individual specifications can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

3. **Clarity**: By encapsulating business rules into specifications, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand.

4. **Extensibility**: New specifications can be added without modifying existing code, making it easy to extend the application with new business rules.

### Visualizing the Specification Pattern

To better understand how specifications are combined, let's visualize the process using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Specification {
        +is_satisfied_by(candidate)
    }
    class ColorSpecification {
        -color
        +is_satisfied_by(product)
    }
    class SizeSpecification {
        -size
        +is_satisfied_by(product)
    }
    class AndSpecification {
        -spec1
        -spec2
        +is_satisfied_by(candidate)
    }
    class OrSpecification {
        -spec1
        -spec2
        +is_satisfied_by(candidate)
    }
    class NotSpecification {
        -spec
        +is_satisfied_by(candidate)
    }
    Specification <|-- ColorSpecification
    Specification <|-- SizeSpecification
    Specification <|-- AndSpecification
    Specification <|-- OrSpecification
    Specification <|-- NotSpecification
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Specification` class and its concrete implementations. `ColorSpecification` and `SizeSpecification` are specific criteria, while `AndSpecification`, `OrSpecification`, and `NotSpecification` are combinators that allow for logical operations on specifications.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Specification Pattern by modifying the code examples. Here are some suggestions:

- **Add a new specification**: Create a `PriceSpecification` to filter products based on price. Combine it with existing specifications to form complex queries.
- **Implement a custom combinator**: Create a `XorSpecification` that returns `True` if exactly one of the specifications is satisfied.
- **Optimize performance**: Consider caching results of specifications that are frequently evaluated to improve performance.

### Knowledge Check
