## 5.6 Memento Pattern

### Introduction

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows capturing and externalizing an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo/redo functionality, manage transactional operations, or maintain historical states of an object.

### Intent of the Memento Pattern

The primary intent of the Memento Pattern is to provide the ability to restore an object to its previous state. This is achieved by capturing the object's state in a Memento object, which can be stored and retrieved as needed. The Memento Pattern ensures that the internal state of the object is saved and restored without exposing its implementation details, thus maintaining encapsulation.

### Components of the Memento Pattern

The Memento Pattern involves three main components:

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It creates a Memento containing a snapshot of its current state and can restore its state from a Memento.

2. **Memento**: A representation of the Originator's internal state at a specific point in time. It is an opaque object that only the Originator can access.

3. **Caretaker**: Manages the Mementos and is responsible for storing and retrieving them. The Caretaker does not modify or inspect the contents of the Memento.

Let's explore these components in more detail with a practical example.

### Python Example: Implementing an Editor with Undo/Redo

To illustrate the Memento Pattern, we'll implement a simple text editor with undo and redo functionality. This example will demonstrate how to capture and restore the editor's state using the Memento Pattern.

#### Step 1: Define the Memento Class

The Memento class will store the state of the editor. It should be a simple class that holds the necessary state information.

```python
class Memento:
    def __init__(self, state: str):
        self._state = state

    def get_state(self) -> str:
        return self._state
```

#### Step 2: Define the Originator Class

The Originator class represents the editor. It can create a Memento to save its state and restore its state from a Memento.

```python
class Editor:
    def __init__(self):
        self._content = ""

    def type(self, words: str):
        self._content += words

    def save(self) -> Memento:
        return Memento(self._content)

    def restore(self, memento: Memento):
        self._content = memento.get_state()

    def get_content(self) -> str:
        return self._content
```

#### Step 3: Define the Caretaker Class

The Caretaker class will manage the Mementos. It will store the Mementos and provide undo and redo functionality.

```python
class Caretaker:
    def __init__(self, editor: Editor):
        self._editor = editor
        self._history = []
        self._redo_stack = []

    def save(self):
        self._history.append(self._editor.save())
        self._redo_stack.clear()

    def undo(self):
        if not self._history:
            return
        memento = self._history.pop()
        self._redo_stack.append(self._editor.save())
        self._editor.restore(memento)

    def redo(self):
        if not self._redo_stack:
            return
        memento = self._redo_stack.pop()
        self._history.append(self._editor.save())
        self._editor.restore(memento)
```

#### Step 4: Demonstrate the Editor with Undo/Redo

Let's see how the editor works with undo and redo functionality.

```python
def main():
    editor = Editor()
    caretaker = Caretaker(editor)

    editor.type("Hello, ")
    caretaker.save()

    editor.type("world!")
    caretaker.save()

    print("Current content:", editor.get_content())  # Output: Hello, world!

    caretaker.undo()
    print("After undo:", editor.get_content())  # Output: Hello, 

    caretaker.redo()
    print("After redo:", editor.get_content())  # Output: Hello, world!

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Encapsulation Concerns

One of the key benefits of the Memento Pattern is that it maintains the encapsulation of the Originator's state. The Memento object is an opaque object that only the Originator can access. This ensures that the internal state of the Originator is not exposed to the outside world, preserving the integrity of the object's encapsulation.

### Practical Applications

The Memento Pattern is widely used in various applications, including:

- **Transactional Operations**: The Memento Pattern can be used to implement transactional operations where you need to rollback changes if an error occurs.

- **Undo Mechanisms**: Many applications, such as text editors and graphic design software, use the Memento Pattern to implement undo and redo functionality.

- **State History**: The Memento Pattern can be used to maintain a history of an object's state, allowing you to navigate through different states over time.

### Performance Considerations

When implementing the Memento Pattern, it's important to consider the performance implications of storing multiple states. Storing a large number of Mementos can consume significant memory, especially if the state of the Originator is large.

To manage memory efficiently, consider the following strategies:

- **Snapshots vs. Deltas**: Instead of storing the entire state, consider storing only the differences (deltas) between states. This can significantly reduce memory usage.

- **State Compression**: Use compression techniques to reduce the size of the stored states.

- **State Pruning**: Implement a strategy to prune older states that are no longer needed to free up memory.

### Best Practices

To effectively implement the Memento Pattern, consider the following best practices:

- **Efficient State Storage**: Use snapshots or deltas to store states efficiently and minimize memory usage.

- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that the Memento object is an opaque object that only the Originator can access, preserving encapsulation.

- **State Management**: Implement strategies to manage the lifecycle of stored states, such as pruning or compressing states.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Memento Pattern, try modifying the example code to add additional features:

- **Versioning**: Implement a versioning system to label different states.
- **State Comparison**: Add functionality to compare two states and highlight differences.
- **State Persistence**: Implement a mechanism to persist states to disk and reload them.

### Visualizing the Memento Pattern

Below is a class diagram illustrating the relationships between the components of the Memento Pattern.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Editor {
        - content: str
        + type(words: str)
        + save() Memento
        + restore(memento: Memento)
        + get_content() str
    }

    class Memento {
        - state: str
        + get_state() str
    }

    class Caretaker {
        - history: List~Memento~
        - redo_stack: List~Memento~
        + save()
        + undo()
        + redo()
    }

    Editor --> Memento
    Caretaker --> Memento
    Caretaker --> Editor
```
