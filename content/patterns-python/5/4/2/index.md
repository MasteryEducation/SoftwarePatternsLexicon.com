## 5.4.2 Custom Iterators with `__iter__` and `__next__`

In this section, we delve into the fascinating world of custom iterators in Python. Iterators are a cornerstone of Python's design, enabling efficient looping over collections and custom data structures. By mastering the iterator protocol, which consists of the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods, you can create powerful and flexible iterable objects tailored to your specific needs.

### Understanding the Iterator Protocol

The iterator protocol in Python is a fundamental concept that allows objects to be iterated over in a consistent and efficient manner. It consists of two main methods:

- **`__iter__()`**: This method returns the iterator object itself. It is called when an iteration is initialized, such as when a loop begins.

- **`__next__()`**: This method returns the next item from the collection. When there are no more items to return, it raises a `StopIteration` exception to signal the end of the iteration.

Let's explore these concepts with a practical example by creating a custom iterable class that models a deck of cards.

### Creating a Custom Iterable: Deck of Cards

To illustrate the iterator protocol, we'll build a `Deck` class that models a standard deck of playing cards. This class will implement both the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods to allow iteration over the deck.

```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit, rank):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.rank} of {self.suit}"

class Deck:
    suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
    ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace']

    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = [Card(suit, rank) for suit in self.suits for rank in self.ranks]

    def __iter__(self):
        self._index = 0
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self._index < len(self.cards):
            card = self.cards[self._index]
            self._index += 1
            return card
        else:
            raise StopIteration

deck = Deck()
for card in deck:
    print(card)
```

#### Explanation

- **Card Class**: Represents individual cards with a suit and rank.
- **Deck Class**: Contains a list of `Card` objects representing a full deck.
  - **`__iter__()`**: Initializes the iteration by setting an index to zero and returns the iterator object (itself).
  - **`__next__()`**: Retrieves the next card in the deck. If the end of the deck is reached, it raises `StopIteration`.

### Error Handling with `StopIteration`

Handling the `StopIteration` exception is crucial for the iterator protocol. This exception is used to signal that there are no more items to iterate over. In our `Deck` class, `StopIteration` is raised when the `_index` exceeds the number of cards.

#### Managing `StopIteration`

When implementing custom iterators, ensure that `StopIteration` is raised correctly to prevent infinite loops and other errors. This exception is automatically handled by Python's `for` loop, which stops iterating when `StopIteration` is encountered.

### Considerations for Custom Iterators

When designing custom iterators, consider the following:

- **Reusability**: Decide whether your iterator should be reusable. In our example, the `Deck` iterator is not reusable because it resets the index each time `__iter__()` is called. To make it reusable, you could return a new iterator object each time.

- **State Management**: Keep track of the iteration state carefully. In our `Deck` class, the `_index` variable manages the current position in the iteration.

- **Performance**: Ensure that your iterator is efficient, especially if it deals with large datasets or complex operations.

### Enhancing the Deck with Shuffling

To add more functionality to our `Deck` class, let's implement a method to shuffle the cards. This will demonstrate how to modify the internal state of an iterable object.

```python
import random

class Deck:
    # ... (previous code)

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

deck = Deck()
deck.shuffle()
for card in deck:
    print(card)
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the `Deck` class by modifying the code:

- **Add Jokers**: Extend the `Deck` class to include Joker cards.
- **Reverse Order**: Implement a method to iterate over the deck in reverse order.
- **Custom Iteration**: Create a custom iteration pattern, such as skipping every other card.

### Visualizing the Iterator Protocol

To better understand the flow of the iterator protocol, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Deck
    participant Card

    Client->>Deck: Call __iter__()
    Deck->>Client: Return self (iterator)

    loop Until StopIteration
        Client->>Deck: Call __next__()
        Deck->>Card: Get next card
        Card-->>Deck: Return card
        Deck-->>Client: Return card
    end

    Deck->>Client: Raise StopIteration
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the client (e.g., a `for` loop), the `Deck` class, and the `Card` class during iteration. The client repeatedly calls `__next__()` on the `Deck` until `StopIteration` is raised.

### Advanced Custom Iterators

Custom iterators can be more complex, involving additional logic and state management. Let's explore a more advanced example: a `Fibonacci` iterator that generates Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.

```python
class Fibonacci:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.a, self.b = 0, 1

    def __iter__(self):
        self._current = 0
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self._current < self.limit:
            value = self.a
            self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b
            self._current += 1
            return value
        else:
            raise StopIteration

fib = Fibonacci(10)
for number in fib:
    print(number)
```

#### Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `Fibonacci` class initializes with a limit and the first two Fibonacci numbers.
- **Iteration**: The `__next__()` method generates the next Fibonacci number and updates the sequence.

### Reusability and Fresh Iterators

To create reusable iterators, consider returning a new iterator object from `__iter__()` instead of the same object. This approach allows multiple iterations over the same data without resetting the state.

```python
class ReusableDeck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = [Card(suit, rank) for suit in Deck.suits for rank in Deck.ranks]

    def __iter__(self):
        return DeckIterator(self.cards)

class DeckIterator:
    def __init__(self, cards):
        self.cards = cards
        self._index = 0

    def __next__(self):
        if self._index < len(self.cards):
            card = self.cards[self._index]
            self._index += 1
            return card
        else:
            raise StopIteration

reusable_deck = ReusableDeck()
for card in reusable_deck:
    print(card)
```

#### Explanation

- **`ReusableDeck` Class**: Returns a new `DeckIterator` object each time `__iter__()` is called, ensuring fresh iteration.

### Knowledge Check
