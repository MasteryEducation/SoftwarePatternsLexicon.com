## 5.5.1 Implementing Mediator in Python

In the world of software design patterns, the Mediator Pattern stands out as a powerful tool for managing complex communications between objects. By centralizing control logic, the Mediator Pattern helps to reduce dependencies between interacting objects, leading to more maintainable and scalable code. In this section, we will delve into the implementation of the Mediator Pattern in Python, exploring how it can be used to streamline communication and control within your applications.

### Understanding the Mediator Pattern

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Instead of objects communicating directly with each other, they communicate through a mediator object. This pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, allowing their interaction to be varied independently.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Mediator**: The central object that facilitates communication between colleague objects.
- **Colleague**: Objects that communicate with each other through the mediator.

### Implementing the Mediator Pattern in Python

Let's walk through a step-by-step guide to implementing the Mediator Pattern in Python. We'll create a simple chat application where users (colleagues) send messages to each other through a chat room (mediator).

#### Step 1: Define the Mediator Interface

First, we need to define an interface for our mediator. This interface will declare methods that the mediator will use to facilitate communication between colleagues.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Mediator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_message(self, message: str, colleague: 'Colleague'):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Concrete Mediator

Next, we'll implement a concrete mediator class that will handle the actual communication logic. This class will maintain a list of colleagues and provide a method for sending messages.

```python
class ChatRoom(Mediator):
    def __init__(self):
        self.participants = []

    def register(self, colleague: 'Colleague'):
        self.participants.append(colleague)

    def send_message(self, message: str, sender: 'Colleague'):
        for participant in self.participants:
            if participant != sender:
                participant.receive(message)
```

#### Step 3: Define the Colleague Interface

Now, let's define the interface for our colleague classes. This interface will declare methods for sending and receiving messages.

```python
class Colleague(ABC):
    def __init__(self, mediator: Mediator):
        self.mediator = mediator

    @abstractmethod
    def send(self, message: str):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def receive(self, message: str):
        pass
```

#### Step 4: Implement Concrete Colleagues

We will create concrete colleague classes that will implement the methods defined in the colleague interface. These classes will use the mediator to send messages.

```python
class User(Colleague):
    def __init__(self, name: str, mediator: Mediator):
        super().__init__(mediator)
        self.name = name

    def send(self, message: str):
        print(f"{self.name} sends: {message}")
        self.mediator.send_message(message, self)

    def receive(self, message: str):
        print(f"{self.name} receives: {message}")
```

#### Step 5: Demonstrate the Mediator Pattern

Let's put everything together and demonstrate how the mediator pattern works in our chat application.

```python
def main():
    chat_room = ChatRoom()

    alice = User("Alice", chat_room)
    bob = User("Bob", chat_room)
    charlie = User("Charlie", chat_room)

    chat_room.register(alice)
    chat_room.register(bob)
    chat_room.register(charlie)

    alice.send("Hello, everyone!")
    bob.send("Hi, Alice!")
    charlie.send("Hey, folks!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Communication Flow

In the code above, the communication flow is as follows:

1. **Registration**: Users (colleagues) register with the chat room (mediator).
2. **Message Sending**: When a user sends a message, it goes through the chat room.
3. **Message Routing**: The chat room forwards the message to all registered users except the sender.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Mediator Pattern, it's important to consider the following:

- **Avoid Excessive Complexity**: Keep the mediator simple to prevent it from becoming a "god object" that knows too much about the system.
- **Decoupling**: Ensure that colleagues remain decoupled from each other by communicating only through the mediator.
- **Scalability**: The mediator pattern can help scale systems by centralizing control logic, but be mindful of potential bottlenecks if the mediator becomes too complex.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by adding new users or modifying the message sending logic. Try implementing additional features such as private messaging or user status updates to see how the mediator pattern can be extended.

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

To better understand how the Mediator Pattern works, let's visualize the communication flow using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User1 as Alice
    participant User2 as Bob
    participant User3 as Charlie
    participant Mediator as ChatRoom

    User1->>Mediator: send("Hello, everyone!")
    Mediator->>User2: receive("Hello, everyone!")
    Mediator->>User3: receive("Hello, everyone!")

    User2->>Mediator: send("Hi, Alice!")
    Mediator->>User1: receive("Hi, Alice!")
    Mediator->>User3: receive("Hi, Alice!")

    User3->>Mediator: send("Hey, folks!")
    Mediator->>User1: receive("Hey, folks!")
    Mediator->>User2: receive("Hey, folks!")
```
