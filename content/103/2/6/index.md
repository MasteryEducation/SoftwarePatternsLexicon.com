## Temporal Constraints

### Introduction

Temporal constraints are essential when managing temporal data in databases, particularly for enforcing non-overlapping valid times for the same entity. This pattern is often seen in systems where events, changes, or states need to be tracked over time, such as customer addresses, products' prices, or employees' roles.

### Problem Statement

When handling temporal data, there is often a need to ensure that the recorded periods do not overlap for a single point of interest. For instance, a customer should not have two addresses deemed valid simultaneously. Overlaps in valid-time periods can lead to ambiguity and data inconsistencies.

### Solution

The temporal constraints pattern enforces rules to prevent overlapping periods of validity. This can be achieved through:

1. **Constraints in Database Systems** - Using SQL constraints or triggers that check for overlaps.
2. **Application Logic** - Implementing checks within the application to validate input periods before database insertion or updates.

### Implementation Strategy

#### Using SQL Constraints

To implement temporal constraints, you can use SQL common table expressions (CTEs) with window functions to detect overlapping intervals. Here's a SQL-based approach:

```sql
WITH Overlaps AS (
  SELECT a.id, a.valid_from, a.valid_to,
         LAG(a.valid_to) OVER (PARTITION BY a.customer_id ORDER BY a.valid_from) AS prev_valid_to
  FROM addresses a
)
SELECT *
FROM Overlaps
WHERE prev_valid_to > valid_from;
```

In this query, we partition the data by customer_id and order it by `valid_from`, using the `LAG` function to detect overlaps.

#### Application Logic Example

Using application logic, especially in languages like Java or Kotlin, can complement database checks:

```java
public boolean isPeriodValid(List<Address> addresses, Address newAddress) {
    for (Address current : addresses) {
        if (current.getValidTo().isAfter(newAddress.getValidFrom()) &&
            current.getValidFrom().isBefore(newAddress.getValidTo())) {
            return false; // Overlapping period
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Related Patterns

- **Snapshot Pattern**: Takes a snapshot of record data at different points in time but does not handle overlapping directly.
- **Versioned Entities**: Manages different versions of an entity over time, focusing more on historical records rather than enforcing non-overlapping periods.

### Best Practices

- Ensure that the chosen method for enforcing constraints aligns with the system’s performance needs, especially on large datasets where query cost can be significant.
- Consider indexing strategies that enable efficient partitioning and retrieval based on temporal data.
- Centralize validation logic to reduce redundancy and mismatches between application logic and database constraints.

### Additional Resources

### Conclusion

Temporal constraints are a vital design pattern in data modeling as they help maintain the integrity and accuracy of temporal data. Proper implementation of these constraints ensures that records such as a customer's addresses remain non-overlapping and sequentially coherent over time. By combining database techniques and application logic, effective temporal data management can be accomplished.
