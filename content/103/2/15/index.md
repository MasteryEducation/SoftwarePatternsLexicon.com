## Introduction

In data management, particularly within bitemporal databases, the **Versioning with Temporal Data** design pattern plays a critical role in tracking historical data changes and ensuring data integrity. This pattern assigns a version number to each temporal record, allowing systems to seamlessly trace back modifications over time and understand the data's evolutionary history.

## Pattern Overview

Versioning with temporal data involves extending the temporal data model to incorporate a version identifier. This identifier serves as a metadata attribute connected to each record in the temporal dataset, typically pairing with business and system time dimensions in bitemporal tables. It is especially useful in scenarios where data accuracy across different timespans is crucial.

## Use Case Example

Imagine a system that maintains employee salary records:

- **Business Time**: The effective date range of the salary update.
- **System Time**: When the update was recorded in the database.
- **Version**: An incremented integer that represents each change to the salary record.

Here's a simple SQL representation of such a structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeSalary (
    EmployeeID INT,
    SalaryAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    BusinessStartDate DATE,
    BusinessEndDate DATE,
    SystemStartTime TIMESTAMP,
    SystemEndTime TIMESTAMP,
    Version INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, BusinessStartDate, SystemStartTime, Version)
);
```

Whenever a salary is updated, a new row is added with an incremented version number while preserving historical entries:

```sql
INSERT INTO EmployeeSalary (EmployeeID, SalaryAmount, BusinessStartDate, BusinessEndDate, SystemStartTime, SystemEndTime, Version)
VALUES (12345, 70000, '2024-01-01', '2099-12-31', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999', 2);
```

## Architectural Components

The main components of this pattern include:

- **Temporal Tables**: Incorporate separate attributes for business and system time, enriched by a version attribute.
- **Version Identifier**: Helps track and query specific versions of the data for auditing or reporting.
- **CRUD Operations Modifications**: Adapt create, read, update, and delete operations to account for version handling.

## Benefits and Best Practices

### Benefits:
- Ensures meticulous audit trails of data changes.
- Supports temporal queries on different historical versions of data.
- Protects against erroneous data updates and provides contextual insights.

### Best Practices:
- Consistently increment version numbers upon data modification events.
- Make use of compound keys (including version) for accurate record retrieval.
- Consider archiving older versions to manage database size.

## Related Patterns

- **Pseudo-Temporal Versions**: Incorporates versions without full bitemporal consistency.
- **Event Sourcing**: Persisting changes as a sequence of events rather than just the latest state snapshot.

## Summary

Versioning with Temporal Data is a powerful design pattern that equips systems with the capability to manage evolving datasets over time. By integrating version control within temporal tables, databases can achieve enhanced data integrity and provide comprehensive historical insights. This pattern is of marked importance in domains requiring stringent auditing and detailed temporal analysis.
