## Handling Open-Ended Valid Times

### Introduction

In the design of bitemporal tables, dealing with open-ended valid times is a crucial aspect. Bitemporal tables allow us to track both the (current) reality and modifications over time without losing any information about the sequence and timing of those changes. This requires special handling of the `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` fields, especially when the end of validity is not known.

### Design Pattern Overview

This design pattern involves using designated 'infinity' values in the `ValidTo` attribute to represent ongoing validity. A common strategy is to use a date such as `9999-12-31`, which is effectively treated as an infinity point far in the future. It allows for continuity and clarity when filtering records to ascertain which are currently valid.

### Architectural Approach

1. **Schema Design**:
    - Define tables with `ValidFrom` and `ValidTo` columns to manage temporal validity.
    - Opt for a data type that supports a wide range of dates, such as SQL's `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP`.

2. **Handling Queries**:
    - Use conditional statements to interpret 'infinity' values correctly:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM Employees 
      WHERE CURRENT_DATE BETWEEN ValidFrom AND ValidTo;
      ```
      Here, `ValidTo` as '9999-12-31' ensures that open-ended validity remains inclusive of all products meant to be active indefinitely.

3. **API and Interfaces**:
    - When exposing data through APIs or application layers, interpret the infinity date correctly to indicate ongoing status without explicitly exposing the artificial value.

4. **Date Constraints**:
    - Establish business logic to set the default `ValidTo` to '9999-12-31' during insert operations if no end date is specified.

### Example Code

Here's an example SQL snippet to demonstrate setting up a bitemporal table, incorporating handling for open-ended valid times:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    ValidFrom DATE NOT NULL,
    ValidTo DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    SYSTEM_TIME GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
    SYSTEM_END TIME GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (SYSTEM_TIME, SYSTEM_END)
);

-- Insert a new employee that is currently valid
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, ValidFrom) 
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', CURRENT_DATE);
```

### Handling Management and Updates

Updates require careful logic to ensure the ongoing validity is consistently applied where no specific end date exists.

```sql
-- Update an employee's end of contract
UPDATE Employees
SET ValidTo = '2024-06-30'
WHERE EmployeeID = 1 AND ValidTo = '9999-12-31';
```

### Related Patterns and Considerations

- **Snapshot Tables**: Taking periodic snapshots to record states that can incorporate similar 'infinity' handling for ongoing attributes.
- **Transaction Time**: To maintain the history of database operations, separate from business validity.

### Conclusion

Handling open-ended valid times in bitemporal databases is a nuanced process that provides powerful capabilities for temporal data management. By setting a well-defined 'infinity' date, this pattern allows for seamless integration of ongoing data validity, ensuring that both current and historical data uses are maintained effectively.
