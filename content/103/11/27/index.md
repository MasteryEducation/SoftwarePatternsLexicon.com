## Introduction

Temporal Aggregation in Stream Processing refers to the technique of computing aggregate values over time-based windows, extracting meaningful insights from continuous data streams. This pattern is fundamental for real-time data analytics where decisions rely on the most recent data.

## Description

Temporal Aggregation involves processing continuous flows of data to calculate metrics like sums, averages, counts, and more, over a defined temporal window. These windows are essential as they provide the boundaries over which computations are performed. Common window types include:

- *Tumbling windows* that do not overlap and cover time periods of a fixed duration.
- *Sliding windows* that overlap, allowing for partial data continuity.
- *Session windows* that are dynamic, ending after inactivity gaps, perfect for user sessions or tracking stop-start activities.

When implementing temporal aggregation in stream processing systems like Apache Flink, we use windowing functions to harness these aggregations, optimizing resource use and response times in real-time computations.

## Architectural Approaches

Implementing Temporal Aggregation demands careful attention to window management and data consistency. Systems like Apache Flink provide robust mechanisms for handling windows, watermarks, and stateful computations crucial for correct temporal aggregation.

1. **Flink Windows**: The core component where data stream segments are processed. Tumbling, sliding, and session windows all aid in organizing continuous input data into manageable portions.

2. **Watermarks**: Special elements in the data stream that help solve issues of out-of-order data by marking points in time, ensuring correct computation especially in distributed, highly asynchronous environments.

3. **Stateful Processing**: Flink maintains the state for event processing, enabling accurate aggregation over windows, stored across checkpoints, to offer fault-tolerance.

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Window Type**: Depending on the use case, the window type (tumbling, sliding, session) affects the insights drawn from the data stream.

2. **Watermarks for Time Management**: Accurate watermarks handling is essential to balance latency and completeness in aggregations, especially with late-arriving data.

3. **Scaling and Recovery**: Leverage Flink's state management and checkpoints to scale operations and ensure recoverability without data loss.

## Example Code

Below is an example of implementing a rolling sum of financial transactions using Apache Flink and tumbling windows:

```java
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.environment.StreamExecutionEnvironment;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.windowing.time.Time;

public class TemporalAggregationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

        DataStream<Transaction> transactions = env.addSource(new TransactionSource());

        DataStream<Double> rollingSum = transactions
            .keyBy(Transaction::getAccountId)
            .timeWindow(Time.minutes(1))
            .sum("amount");

        rollingSum.print();

        env.execute("Temporal Aggregation Example");
    }

    public static class Transaction {
        private int accountId;
        private double amount;

        // Getters and Setters
    }

    public static class TransactionSource extends BaseSourceFunction<Transaction> {
        // Implementation of SourceFunction to generate transactions
    }
}
```
