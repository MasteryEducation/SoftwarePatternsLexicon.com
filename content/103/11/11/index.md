## Temporal Weighted Averages

### Description
Temporal weighted averages are a specialized pattern in data modeling and analytics where each data point in a time series is assigned a weight based on its duration or significance. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where we want longer-duration events or more significant data points to have a greater influence on the average calculation.

### Architectural Approach

- **Data Collection**: Gather time-stamped data points. Each point should have an associated value and a weight coefficient based on its duration or importance.
  
- **Weight Assignment**: Assign weights to each data point. Weights can reflect the duration for which a data point is relevant or other significance criteria.

- **Weighted Calculation**: Use a weighted average formula to compute the overall average. The formula typically involves multiplying each data point by its weight, summing these products, and dividing by the total sum of weights.

- **Incorporation of Decay Functions**: Implement decay functions to reduce the influence of older data points, if necessary.

### Best Practices

- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Ensure that the weights can be dynamically adjusted as new data comes in or as the data context evolves.

- **Handling Missing Data**: Develop strategies to interpolate or ignore missing data points without skewing the average unfairly.

- **Performance Optimization**: For large datasets, optimize the calculation with frameworks that can handle parallel processing or streaming data to ensure real-time computation.

### Example Code

Here is a Scala example illustrating the computation of a temporal weighted average:

```scala
case class DataPoint(value: Double, duration: Long)

def temporalWeightedAverage(dataPoints: List[DataPoint]): Double = {
  val weightedSum = dataPoints.map(dp => dp.value * dp.duration).sum
  val totalDuration = dataPoints.map(_.duration).sum
  weightedSum / totalDuration
}

val data = List(
  DataPoint(3.0, 5),  // value of 3.0 for a duration of 5 units
  DataPoint(5.0, 10), // value of 5.0 for a duration of 10 units
  DataPoint(4.0, 2)   // value of 4.0 for a duration of 2 units
)

val result = temporalWeightedAverage(data)
println(s"Temporal Weighted Average: $result")
```

### Related Patterns

- **Time Series Aggregation**: Temporal weighted averages are a subset of broader time series aggregation patterns used to summarize time-dependent datasets.
  
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Similar to weighted averages, this technique applies weights that decrease exponentially over time.

- **Sliding Window**: In contrast to temporal weighting, sliding window techniques focus on averaging data points within a moving window of time.

### Summary

The temporal weighted averages design pattern is a powerful tool for deriving insights from time series data by recognizing the significance of data durations or predefined importance weights. When implemented with dynamic adjustment and decay functions, it provides a flexible and insightful approach to temporal data modeling. Adopting this pattern offers enhanced precision in data-driven decision-making processes.
