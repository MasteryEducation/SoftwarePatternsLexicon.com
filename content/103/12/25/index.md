## Historical Data Archiving

### Overview

The Historical Data Archiving pattern is a data management strategy designed for bi-temporal data warehouses to efficiently handle historical data while balancing warehouse size and accessibility. This pattern involves the systematic moving of older data—typically data exceeding a certain age like seven years—into an archive database. The archived data retains critical temporal dimensions: valid time, which indicates when the data is relevant, and transaction time, which reflects when the data was stored.

### Architectural Approaches

- **Separation of Storage**: By partitioning the data based on its age, active data remains within the primary warehouse environment, optimized for quick access and performance, while historical data is efficiently stored in less expensive, read-optimized storage.
  
- **Time-Dimensional Indexing**: Utilize indexing strategies that efficiently manage and access both valid time and transaction time dimensions. This supports efficient historical queries without diminishing performance on the active dataset.

- **Automated Data Movement**: Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes that regularly review data ages, extracting data that meets archival criteria and moving it to the archive without manual intervention. This can be automated using tools like Apache NiFi or cloud-based services such as AWS Glue.

### Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Archiving Policies**: Establish business rules defining the timeframe for data to remain in primary storage versus when it should be archived. This can be based on regulatory, operational, or business analytical requirements.
   
2. **Optimize Archive Storage**: Use cost-efficient storage solutions, such as AWS Glacier or Azure Blob Archive Storage, suited for infrequently accessed data but which offers necessary latency for read operations when needed.

3. **Ensure Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across temporal dimensions is crucial; archived data should still reflect accurate historical states without leading to discrepancies or data loss.

4. **Consider Data Compliance**: Always ensure that archived data meets compliance requirements such as GDPR or HIPAA, especially when handling sensitive information or maintaining audit trails.

5. **Implement Logical Data Partitioning**: Use partitioning in archive databases to speed up query responses and make data retrieval as efficient as possible.

### Example Implementation

Here's a sample approach to implementing the Historical Data Archiving pattern:

```sql
-- Example to archive data older than 7 years considering transaction time
CREATE TABLE main_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data_column VARCHAR(255),
    valid_time_start TIMESTAMPTZ,
    valid_time_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
    transaction_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE archive_data LIKE main_data;

INSERT INTO archive_data
SELECT * FROM main_data
WHERE transaction_time < (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 years');

DELETE FROM main_data
WHERE transaction_time < (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 years');
```

### Related Patterns

- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**: Used in dimensional modeling to capture changes in data over time.
- **Temporal Tables**: Database tables with built-in support for versioning of rows with valid and transaction times.
- **Audit Logs**: Ensure that actions leading to archiving are logged, providing a path for traceability and compliance.

### Summary

Historical Data Archiving is a vital design pattern in managing bi-temporal data warehouses, providing both a reduction in storage costs and an increase in system efficiency without sacrificing the ability to perform historical queries. By implementing a carefully architected archiving strategy around separation of storage, indexing, and automated data movement, organizations can maintain comprehensive historical records in a compliant and efficient manner.
