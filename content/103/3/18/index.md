## Introduction

In data warehousing, Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) represent data that evolves slowly over time rather than capturing only the most current state. SCD Type 2 is commonly used to maintain historical data by preserving past records and adding new rows to reflect changes. This design pattern introduces a `ChangeReason` attribute to provide greater context into the nature of each change.

## Problem Statement

Traditional SCD implementations maintain historical changes but offer no direct insight into why data modifications occur. Stakeholders often require knowledge of the motivations behind data transformations for improved decision-making, compliance, and auditing purposes.

## Solution

Incorporate a `ChangeReason` column into the SCD architecture. This enhancement captures metadata about why each change has occurred, allowing users to discern patterns and business logic in data evolution. The `ChangeReason` attribute might contain categorical entries like "Promotion", "Demotion", "Mergers", or "System Update," depending on the specific business context.

### Architectural Approach

1. **Table Design**: Extend the dimension table with a `ChangeReason` column. The column data type should be suitable for holding descriptive text or enumerators that capture reason codes.
   
2. **ETL Process Modification**: During the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, include logic for populating the `ChangeReason` attribute whenever changes to the dimension records are detected.

3. **Change Detection Logic**: Utilize checksums, hashes, or triggers to identify changes between incoming records and existing data in the dimension table.

### Example Code

Below is an example schema definition and ETL logic using SQL and pseudocode to handle SCD with Change Reason Codes.

#### SQL Table Definition

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    CustomerID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    StartDate DATE,
    EndDate DATE,
    IsActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    ChangeReason VARCHAR(100)
);
```

#### ETL Logic Pseudocode

```pseudocode
for each new_record in incoming_records:
    if existing_record found for new_record.CustomerID:
        if existing_record != new_record:
            update existing_record with 'EndDate' = today, 'IsActive' = FALSE
            insert into Customer(new_record, ChangeReason) with 'StartDate' = today, 'IsActive' = TRUE
    else:
        insert into Customer(new_record, ChangeReason) with 'StartDate' = today
```

In this example, `ChangeReason` would be dynamically determined based on the source system or additional logical rules applied in the ETL pipeline.

## Benefits and Best Practices

- **Enhanced Data Transparency**: Provides clarity into changes, aiding audit trails and analytical reporting.
- **Improved Decision Making**: Facilitates understanding of change dynamics, allowing more informed strategic decisions.
- **Supports Regulatory Compliance**: Assists in adhering to data governance policies requiring change auditability.

### Best Practices

- **Standardize `ChangeReason`**: Ensure consistency by standardizing codes or reasons, possibly using a lookup table to prevent discrepancies.
- **Catalog Patterns**: Regularly update and maintain a list of all possible `ChangeReason` entries as business processes evolve.
- **Automate Population**: Use automated systems to populate the `ChangeReason` field whenever feasible to avoid manual errors.

## Related Patterns

- **Audit Trail Pattern**: Recording operational and transactional changes in an audit log for governance and compliance.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Models that capture data evolution over time, suitable for version control in records.

## Summary

The SCD with Change Reason Codes design pattern enhances traditional dimension tables by providing insights into the underlying reasons for changes. This additional transparency supports robust audits, governance compliance, and strategic decision-making by contextualizing data transformations over time. By integrating this pattern into your data modeling toolkit, you can build more informative and actionable data warehouses.
