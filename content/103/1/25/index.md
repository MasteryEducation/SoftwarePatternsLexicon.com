## Overview

Temporal data compression via delta encoding is an efficient method of storing temporal or time-series data by recording only the differences between subsequent data points rather than the complete values. This reduces the amount of storage required, speeds up data transmission, and enhances query performance by minimizing the data volume to process.

## Detailed Explanation

### Design Pattern

- **Motivation**: In applications dealing with time-series data such as financial data, server logs, IoT sensor readings, or stock inventory levels, capturing entire data snapshots can lead to excessive storage use and processing overhead.
  
- **Solution**: Use delta encoding to store the change between consecutive data points instead of absolute values. For example, in a series of stock inventory records, store only the change (delta) in inventory count rather than the total inventory.

### Architecture and Approaches

1. **Data Capture**:
   - Identify the data series suitable for delta encoding.
   - Ensure data is collected in a consistent time-order to facilitate accurate delta computation.

2. **Delta Calculation**:
   - Calculate the difference between current and previous data points (assumes ordered data).
   - Store the initial value, and subsequent entries only store deltas.

3. **Storage**:
   - Use columnar-based storage systems (e.g., Apache Parquet or ORC) that complement delta encoding by providing additional compression.
   - Versioned storage solutions such as Delta Lake or Iceberg could be considered for managing delta data more effectively in a big data environment.

4. **Data Retrieval**:
   - To reconstruct data, apply deltas incrementally starting from the initial stored value.
   - This can be optimized by maintaining periodic checkpoints that store full snapshots periodically to speed up reconstruction.

5. **Data Querying**:
   - Implement delta-aware query algorithms that leverage table indexes for rapid delta applications.
   - Example: Extend SQL capabilities with user-defined functions or stored procedures that automate delta aggregation.

### Best Practices

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure delta calculations include error checks to catch anomalies or unexpected negative deltas.
- **Checkpointing**: Balance between compression efficiency and read performance by establishing periodic check intervals, storing an occasional full snapshot in very active datasets to facilitate quicker reads.
- **Version Control**: Use a versioning strategy that ensures data consistency during concurrent writes and reads, enhancing data integrity and rollback capabilities.

## Example Code

Here's a sample pseudocode demonstrating delta encoding for an inventory tracking system:

```python
from typing import List

def calculate_deltas(data: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    deltas = [data[0]]  # Start with the initial actual value
    for i in range(1, len(data)):
        delta = data[i] - data[i - 1]
        deltas.append(delta)
    return deltas

def reconstruct_data(deltas: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    data = [deltas[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(deltas)):
        current_value = data[-1] + deltas[i]
        data.append(current_value)
    return data

inventory_values = [100, 108, 105, 115, 120]  # Actual values
delta_values = calculate_deltas(inventory_values)
reconstructed_data = reconstruct_data(delta_values)
assert inventory_values == reconstructed_data
```

## Related Patterns

- **Data Compression Patterns**: Utilizing techniques like run-length encoding or columnar storage.
- **Time-based Snapshot Pattern**: Maintaining full data state at regular intervals alongside delta encoding.
- **Versioning Pattern**: Integrating version control mechanisms for delta-stored data to manage data integrity and revisions over time.

## Additional Resources

- Research on **Columnar Data Stores** for enhancing delta encoding performance such as Apache Parquet or Apache ORC.
- Explore **Big Data frameworks** like Apache Spark or Apache Flink, which can work with delta encoded data in distributed datasets.
- Study **Time-Series Databases** like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for integrated support of time-specific queries and delta encodings.

## Summary

Temporal data compression via delta encoding is a powerful and efficient pattern for managing time-series data. By recording only changes rather than entire data states, it reduces storage requirements, enhances retrieval speed, and minimizes network traffic during data transmission. When implemented with considerations for checkpointing and storage format alignment, this pattern can significantly optimize data handling in large-scale and continuous ingest scenarios like IoT, financial, and enterprise logging systems.
