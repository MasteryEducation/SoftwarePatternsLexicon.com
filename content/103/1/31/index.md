## Overview of Temporal Role Assignments

Temporal role assignments provide a mechanism for assigning roles to entities, such as users, within defined time frames or periods. This design pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where roles and permissions need to change over time, either based on business requirements or specific conditions.

## Description

The Temporal Role Assignments pattern allows a system to manage role assignments with start and end dates, making it possible to track which role a user or entity holds at any given point in time. It supports various applications, including administrative permissions in software systems, job assignments in HR systems, and subscription levels in service platforms.

### Example

Consider the example of a company using a role-based access control system, where an employee might be assigned the role of 'Admin' for a project lasting from January 1st to June 30th. After this period, their role may change to 'User'. The system must accurately reflect these changes over time.

## Architectural Approach

To implement Temporal Role Assignments, the following components are typically involved:

- **Entity**: The subject receiving the role (e.g., user, group, employee).
- **Role**: The specific role being assigned (e.g., Admin, User, Editor).
- **Validity Period**: Defined by a start and an end date indicating the role's active duration.

### Database Schema Example

A simplified SQL schema could look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE EntityRoles (
    entity_id INT NOT NULL,
    role_id INT NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (entity_id, role_id, start_date),
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES Roles(id)
);
```

In this schema, `EntityRoles` records the role assignments with associated time frames. The `end_date` might be nullable to signify an indefinite role assignment.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Ensure roles and validity periods are consistently applied and updated across your system.
- **Validation**: Implement checks to prevent overlapping roles for a given entity unless explicitly required.
- **History**: Keep historical data about role assignments for auditing and compliance.
- **Data Integrity**: Use foreign key constraints and suitable indexing to maintain data integrity and improve query performance.

## Related Patterns

- **Temporal Validity**: Dealing with data records that change over time, not specifically focused on role assignments.
- **Audit Logging**: Capturing temporal changes in role assignments for review and compliance checks.

## Additional Resources

- Martin Fowler's temporal patterns in data modeling.
- Various repositories and projects on GitHub related to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementations.

## Summary

The Temporal Role Assignments pattern is an effective way to manage changes in roles over time within a system, ensuring that entities are granted appropriate access based on their current and past roles. By incorporating this pattern, systems can maintain a robust and flexible way to handle dynamic role-based requirements while preserving historical records for auditing purposes.
