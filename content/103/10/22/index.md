## Introduction

In the realm of data modeling, temporal normalization is crucial for managing time-dependent data efficiently and accurately. A common challenge is avoiding temporal update anomalies. These anomalies can lead to inconsistent data when temporal attributes are updated. This pattern discusses techniques for organizing temporal data to eliminate such inconsistencies and ensure robust data integrity over time.

## Related Patterns

- **Temporal Validity Pattern**: Focuses on storing data with relevant start and end dates to capture its validity over time.
- **Bitemporal Modeling**: Manages both system and application time to record changes without data loss.
- **Audit Logging**: Archives past data states and changes for auditing purposes.

## Detailed Explanation

Temporal update anomalies occur when time-dependent data needs modifications at multiple locations to reflect a single change. These anomalies can lead to inconsistencies and increased maintenance complexities. For example, consider a scenario where a supplier's rating is stored with each order. Updating the supplier's rating requires changes across all associated past order records. 

To avoid this, the design can be structured such that temporal attributes are decoupled from the entities they describe:

### Decoupling Temporal Data

1. **Separate Temporal Entities**: Store temporal attributes in separate tables or entities. For example, create a `SupplierRatings` table that stores ratings with effective dates independent of the `Orders` table.
2. **Use Referential Integrity**: Ensure that temporal data maintains integrity by using foreign keys and constraints between primary data entities and their temporal attributes.

#### Example Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Suppliers (
    SupplierID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE SupplierRatings (
    RatingID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SupplierID INT,
    Rating INT,
    EffectiveDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES Suppliers(SupplierID)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SupplierID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES Suppliers(SupplierID)
);
```

### Best Practices

- **Centralize Temporal Data**: Maintain data in a single location to simplify updates and prevent anomalies.
- **Loose Coupling of Entities and Temporal Attributes**: Let the temporal validity of an attribute managed separately from other attributes.
- **Use Versioning**: Implement versioning for temporal data to track changes over time, enabling easy rollback if needed.

## Example Code

Consider a Scala case class design:

```scala
case class Supplier(id: Int, name: String)

case class SupplierRating(supplierId: Int, rating: Int, effectiveDate: java.time.LocalDate)

case class Order(orderId: Int, supplierId: Int, orderDate: java.time.LocalDate)
```

This design uses separate case classes for ratings, decoupling temporal data from the main entity to facilitate easier updates.

## Integration with Systems

In distributed systems, consider using:

- **Event Sourcing**: Emit events reflecting changes, capturing temporal aspects separately.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Let commands and queries handle temporal data differently, ensuring clean separation and eventual consistency.

## Final Summary

Avoiding temporal update anomalies is pivotal in modern data modeling. By separating temporal attributes, applying best practices, and ensuring data integrity through proper constraints and relationships, databases maintain consistency and reduce maintenance efforts. Practicing temporal normalization not only optimizes database performance but also offers clean, manageable, and version-controlled temporal data.

Take advantage of related patterns like temporal validity and bitemporal modeling to build comprehensive, future-proof data-driven applications.
