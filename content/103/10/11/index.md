## Temporal Projection

### Description

Temporal Projection is a design pattern used in data modeling to create views or subsets of temporal data. This pattern focuses on including only the necessary temporal attributes, reducing complexity, and focusing on the most relevant aspects of temporal data, such as the current state of data entities. It helps in managing and analyzing temporal data effectively by filtering out historical records based on specific attributes like valid time or transaction time.

### Architectural Approach

The Temporal Projection pattern can be applied using different architectural strategies depending on the database technology:

- **SQL Databases**: Typically involves creating views or using SELECT queries with WHERE clauses that filter data based on temporal conditions. For instance, you might filter records to show only those with a `valid_to` date that is NULL or greater than the current date, indicating currently valid records.

- **NoSQL Databases**: In document or key-value stores, temporal projection can be implemented by including temporal attributes in the document schema and using queries that filter based on these attributes.

### Best Practices

- Use indexes on temporal attributes to enhance query performance.
- Regularly update temporal projections to ensure they reflect the most accurate and current data state.
- Design your temporal attributes to be flexible and support future business requirements for temporal data analysis.

### Example Code

Here's how you can implement a Temporal Projection in a SQL database:

```sql
CREATE VIEW CurrentOrders AS
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, Status
FROM Orders
WHERE ValidTo IS NULL OR ValidTo > CURRENT_DATE;
```

This SQL view filters the `Orders` table to only include orders that are currently valid.

### Related Patterns

- **Temporal Validity**: Focuses on managing and maintaining valid times for data, crucial for projecting temporal representations.
- **Bitemporal Data**: Involves using two time dimensions—valid time and transaction time—which can also benefit from temporal projection techniques.
- **Event Sourcing**: Retains a sequence of historical states (events) but can use temporal projection for current state views.

### Summary

Temporal Projection is an essential pattern for data normalization and management in temporal databases. By focusing on the projection of temporal attributes, it assists in simplifying database queries and highlighting current, relevant data. This pattern is highly applicable to any data system where temporal relationships play a pivotal role, particularly when dealing with vast amounts of historical data that needs to be periodically accessed and assessed.
