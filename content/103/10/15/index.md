## Introduction

In the realm of temporal databases, handling data that involves time-based attributes often leads to intricate challenges, particularly when dealing with multivalued dependencies. Temporal Multivalued Dependencies (TMDs) address design scenarios where entities have attributes that vary over time, necessitating an effective normalization strategy.

## Design Pattern Overview

### Temporal Multivalued Dependencies

TMDs extend the concept of multivalued dependencies by focusing on attributes whose values can change independently over various time periods. This pattern is applicable when a relationship must maintain temporal coherence, separating stable (non-temporal) data from those attributes susceptible to temporal variation.

### Identifying TMDs

To accurately model temporal attributes, it is essential to identify situations where changes occur independently of each other, often leading to unnecessary data duplication. For example, consider an employee table with a multivalued dependency where various skills are valid during different dates.

## Architectural Approach and Best Practices

### Design Strategy

1. **Temporal Segmentation**: 
   Split temporal attributes from non-temporal entities to simplify the logical schema while preserving the integrity of data over time. Apply this separation consistently to facilitate temporal queries.

2. **Use of Temporal Keys**: 
   Introduce temporal keys, such as start and end dates, to delineate time periods during which specific data values are valid. This transformation aids in accommodating future extensions or changes.

3. **Contextual Referencing**:
   Develop associations between temporal and non-temporal data using foreign keys, promoting reuse and reducing data redundancy.

### Example Code

Here is an example demonstrating how to manage skills with temporal attributes in an SQL database:

```sql
-- Non-temporal base table for employee
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    employee_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name          VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Temporal table for employee skills
CREATE TABLE EmployeeSkill (
    employee_id   INT,
    skill         VARCHAR(100),
    start_date    DATE,
    end_date      DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, skill, start_date),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employee(employee_id)
);

-- Inserting data
INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');
INSERT INTO EmployeeSkill (employee_id, skill, start_date, end_date) VALUES (1, 'Java', '2023-05-01', '2023-12-31');
```

## Summary

Temporal Multivalued Dependencies offer a critical design pattern ensuring robust solutions when dealing with time-variant data in databases. By separating temporal attributes, incorporating temporal keys, and implementing proper normalization strategies, you can achieve a flexible, scalable, and maintainable data model. This design pattern is pivotal for contexts demanding historical accuracy and temporal querying capabilities.
