## Versioned APIs

### Overview

The Versioned APIs pattern is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility while evolving the functionality and contracts of an API. This design pattern allows different versions of an API to coexist, enabling the introduction of new features and changes without disrupting existing clients that depend on older API versions.

### Architectural Motivation

Versioning is a fundamental aspect of API lifecycle management, particularly in cloud computing environments where APIs serve as the primary interface for system interactions. Maintaining multiple API versions allows service providers to enhance or fix APIs while providing ample time for clients to adapt to the changes. This approach mitigates the risks associated with breaking changes that may otherwise lead to significant application failures or customer dissatisfaction.

### Implementation Strategies

There are several strategies for implementing versioned APIs:

1. **URI Versioning**: Indicating the version within the URL path, e.g., `/api/v1/resource`. This approach is straightforward and explicit, making it immediately clear to clients which version they are using.

2. **Query Parameters**: Including the version as a query parameter, e.g., `/api/resource?version=1`. This method provides flexibility but might be less discoverable than URI versioning.

3. **Header Versioning**: Specifying the version in the request headers, e.g., `X-API-Version: 1`. This technique decouples the version information from the URL, but it requires clients to handle headers explicitly.

4. **Content Negotiation**: Using the `Accept` header to specify the version, e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.mycompany.v1+json`. This approach benefits hypermedia APIs and provides flexibility, but it is more complex to implement.

### Example

Consider an online service with the following versioned REST API endpoints:

- **V1 Endpoint**: `/api/v1/users`
  - Provides basic user information.
  - Supported operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD).

- **V2 Endpoint**: `/api/v2/users`
  - Extends user information to include profiles and settings.
  - Introduces a search feature.

Here is an example of a simple API versioning strategy using URI versioning in a Java Spring Boot application:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/{version}/users")
public class UserApi {

    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<User>> getUsers(@PathVariable String version) {
        if ("v1".equals(version)) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>(userService.getUsersV1(), HttpStatus.OK);
        } else if ("v2".equals(version)) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>(userService.getUsersV2(), HttpStatus.OK);
        }
        return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }

    // Additional methods for handling V1 and V2 specific logic
}
```

### Considerations

- **Deprecation Strategy**: Clearly define a deprecation policy to phase out older versions. Communicate changes and timelines to clients early to minimize disruption.

- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for each version, including change logs and compatibility notes.

- **Testing**: Ensure thorough testing across all versions to verify consistency and compatibility.

- **Resource Overhead**: Managing multiple versions can increase complexity and overhead in terms of maintenance and resources.

### Related Patterns

- **API Gateway**: Often used to manage routing to different API versions seamlessly.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures that clients see no interruption when new API versions are released.
- **Canary Release**: Allows gradual rollout and testing of new API versions.

### Summary

The Versioned APIs design pattern is essential for efficiently managing API changes and ensuring backward compatibility. It involves various strategies, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. Proper planning, including a clear deprecation strategy and robust documentation, is crucial for successful implementation and client satisfaction. By adopting this pattern, organizations can confidently evolve their APIs while minimizing the impact on existing consumers.
