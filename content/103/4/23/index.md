## Overview

The Versioned Identifiers pattern involves incorporating version information directly into the identifiers or keys used to reference entities or records. This approach effectively manages data pertaining to different versions of an entity, allowing for seamless transitions, backward compatibility, and forward compatibility in systems where version control and data integrity are crucial.

## When to Use

- **Evolving Systems**: When an application evolves over time, requiring the ability to access or modify specific versions of an entity.
- **Data Integrity**: To ensure that data referencing different versions of an entity remain consistent and traceable.
- **APIs and Integrations**: When integrating or interfacing with third-party systems that may change over time.
- **Concurrent Versions**: When multiple versions of the same entity are active simultaneously, and there is a need to reference them individually.

## Benefits

- **Traceability**: Easy tracking of changes and modifications across different versions.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Applications or systems can maintain support for older versions while newer versions are being deployed.
- **Version Management**: Simplified retrieval and management of data corresponding to specific versions.

## Challenges

- **Complexity**: Managing versioning requires additional overhead in both development and maintenance.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that versioning does not introduce inconsistencies in data processing or storage.
- **Resource Management**: Potential for increased resource consumption due to storage of multiple data versions.

## Implementation

Incorporating version information into identifiers typically involves appending or integrating version data with the primary identifier. Below is a basic format and sample code illustrating one approach in Java.

### Example Format

`<EntityID>-<Version>`

### Sample Code (Java)

```java
public class VersionedEntity {
    private String entityId;
    private int version;

    public VersionedEntity(String entityId, int version) {
        this.entityId = entityId;
        this.version = version;
    }

    public String getVersionedId() {
        return entityId + "-V" + version;
    }

    // example getter and setter methods
    public String getEntityId() {
        return entityId;
    }

    public void setEntityId(String entityId) {
        this.entityId = entityId;
    }

    public int getVersion() {
        return version;
    }

    public void setVersion(int version) {
        this.version = version;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VersionedEntity product = new VersionedEntity("P1234", 2);
        System.out.println("Versioned ID: " + product.getVersionedId());
    }
}
```

## Related Patterns

- **Event Sourcing**: Involves capturing all changes to the state as a sequence of events, useful in inherently remembering the history of an entity.
- **Snapshot Pattern**: Storing a snapshot of the data at regular intervals allows the restoration of a newer state of an entity.
- **Optimistic Locking**: Used to prevent conflicts when multiple transactions are attempting to modify an entity.

## Summary

The Versioned Identifiers pattern is a powerful technique for managing evolving data structures and applications, ensuring compatibility and integrity across versions. By embedding version information directly in identifiers, systems gain a straightforward mechanism to manage multiple generations of entities, improving both traceability and adaptability to changes over time. However, this power comes with added complexity, necessitating careful design and ongoing maintenance focus.
