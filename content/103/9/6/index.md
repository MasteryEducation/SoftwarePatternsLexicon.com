## Overview

The Backdating Adjustments pattern involves modifying historical data to reflect that changes were effective from a past date. It’s particularly important in systems where past accuracy directly influences decisions or reporting, such as financial applications, HR systems, compliance monitoring, and legal contracts.

### Applicability

- **Correcting Past Data**: Commonly used when administrative errors are identified, such as incorrect hire dates, and retrospective corrections are needed.
- **Financial Systems**: Adjustments in stock prices, financial statements, or interest rates that must reflect previous periods.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: When compliance standards evolve, past records may require reformation to meet new criteria.

## Architectural Approach

### Design Considerations

1. **Temporal Data Management**: Implement database schemas or storage strategies that efficiently handle historical data states, typically using temporal tables or time-stamped versions.
2. **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs to record original data, adjustments, and rationales for changes.
3. **Versioning**: Utilize data versioning to manage different states of the data without overwriting historical records.
4. **Business Logic**: Ensure that logic reflects the adjusted dates where applicable in analytics and operations, not just in data presentation.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Correction Areas**: Determine which data elements require backdating and the respective new effective dates.
2. **Data Versioning**: Implement mechanisms for capturing versions of the data pre- and post-adjustment.
3. **Audit Logging**: Ensure each change is logged with metadata including reason, user, and timestamp.
4. **User Interface Adjustments**: If applicable, update user interfaces to support backdating functionalities, complete with validation and authorization requirements.
5. **Consistency Checks**: Implement checks to ensure data consistency across all states after changes.

## Sample Code

Below is a pseudo-code example illustrating how backdating might be implemented in a database with temporal table support:

```sql
-- Correcting an employee's hire date using temporal tables

-- Before backdating, log current state to audit
INSERT INTO employee_audit (employee_id, original_hire_date, entry_timestamp)
SELECT employee_id, hire_date, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 123;

-- Backdate correction
UPDATE employees
SET hire_date = '2023-01-10'
WHERE employee_id = 123
AND hire_date > '2023-01-10';

-- Verify the change
SELECT * FROM employees FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF 'BEFORE MODIFY TIMESTAMP'
WHERE employee_id = 123;
```

## Related Patterns

- **Audit Log**: Keep track of all changes made within the system for traceability and compliance purposes.
- **Event Sourcing**: Stores state changes as a sequence of events, allowing retrospective state calculations.
- **Temporal Pattern**: Utilize time-dimensioned data models to manage and query historical data efficiently.

## Summary

The Backdating Adjustments pattern is essential for systems requiring historical accuracy and compliance. When implemented carefully, it preserves the integrity of data, ensures precise record-keeping, satisfies regulatory requirements, and supports retrospective analysis. By combining temporal data handling, versioning, and audit capabilities, this pattern facilitates seamless rectification of past records, enabling enterprises to maintain trustworthy and reliable data landscapes over time.
