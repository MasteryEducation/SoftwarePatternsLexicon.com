## Effective Dating

### Description

Effective Dating is a pattern utilized for scheduling data changes to occur at a specific future date. It is highly beneficial for operations that require predefined changes to be applied automatically when a certain date is reached. This approach can mitigate the need for daily manual updates, reduce the risk of oversight, and ensure business processes are aligned with strategy changes, personnel updates, or regulatory compliance.

### Application and Benefits

The Effective Dating pattern is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
- **Employee Promotions:** Scheduling raises or new benefits to activate on an anniversary.
- **Pricing Strategies:** Implementing new pricing models that take effect at the start of a fiscal period.
- **Policy Changes:** Enabling future business policy adjustments to automate on a target date.

### Architectural Approach

The implementation of Effective Dating involves the following components:
1. **Temporal Data Storage:** Store current and future data state along with an effective date.
2. **Scheduled Jobs or Triggers:** Implement triggers or cron jobs to check and activate changes as dates are reached.
3. **Data Migration and Rollback:** Enableable means for applying and, if necessary, rolling back changes.
4. **Audit Logging:** Maintain a history of changes applied for compliance and audit purposes.

### Example Code

Below is a sample implementation of an Effective Dating pattern using Java and SQL.

```java
// SQL Table Definition
CREATE TABLE EmployeePromotions (
    employee_id INT,
    old_position VARCHAR(100),
    new_position VARCHAR(100),
    effective_date DATE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

// Scheduled Job in Java
public class PromotionScheduler {

    public void applyPromotions(LocalDate currentDate) {
        List<EmployeePromotion> pendingPromotions = fetchPendingPromotions(currentDate);
        pendingPromotions.forEach(promotion -> {
            applyPromotion(promotion);
            markPromotionAsActive(promotion);
        });
    }

    private List<EmployeePromotion> fetchPendingPromotions(LocalDate date) {
        // Logic to fetch promotions with effective_date equal to 'date' and is_active = FALSE
    }

    private void applyPromotion(EmployeePromotion promotion) {
        // Logic to update the employee's position
    }

    private void markPromotionAsActive(EmployeePromotion promotion) {
        // Logic to set is_active to TRUE
    }
}
```

### Related Patterns

- **Temporal Patterns**: Incorporates various strategies to manage data that depends on time, like bitemporal or hypertable designs.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Complements the pattern by listening for time-based events to initiate changes.
- **Batch Processing**: Utilized when multiple changes must be applied simultaneously, guided by the data's effective date.

### Summary

Effective Dating is a strategic approach to handle future data states efficiently, allowing businesses to prepare for scheduled changes without ongoing maintenance overhead. This pattern enhances automation, improves systematic data management, and supports complex organizational operations that are temporally driven.
