## 2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals in Swift

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. OOP in Swift is a powerful tool for organizing code in a way that is both intuitive and efficient. In this section, we will delve into the core concepts of OOP in Swift, including classes and objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. These concepts form the foundation of many design patterns and are essential for robust Swift development.

### Classes and Objects

In Swift, classes are one of the primary building blocks for object-oriented programming. A class defines a blueprint for objects, encapsulating data and behavior. Let's explore how to create and use classes in Swift.

#### Creating a Class

To define a class in Swift, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces `{}`. Inside the braces, you can define properties and methods.

```swift
class Vehicle {
    var brand: String
    var model: String
    var year: Int

    init(brand: String, model: String, year: Int) {
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
    }

    func startEngine() {
        print("Engine started for \\(brand) \\(model).")
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Vehicle` class has three properties: `brand`, `model`, and `year`. It also includes an initializer `init` to set these properties and a method `startEngine` to perform an action.

#### Creating an Object

An object is an instance of a class. You can create an object by calling the class's initializer.

```swift
let myCar = Vehicle(brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2020)
myCar.startEngine() // Output: Engine started for Toyota Corolla.
```

Here, `myCar` is an instance of the `Vehicle` class. We initialize it with specific values for the brand, model, and year.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

#### Defining a Subclass

To create a subclass, use the colon `:` followed by the superclass name.

```swift
class ElectricVehicle: Vehicle {
    var batteryCapacity: Int

    init(brand: String, model: String, year: Int, batteryCapacity: Int) {
        self.batteryCapacity = batteryCapacity
        super.init(brand: brand, model: model, year: year)
    }

    override func startEngine() {
        print("Electric engine started for \\(brand) \\(model).")
    }
}
```

In this example, `ElectricVehicle` is a subclass of `Vehicle`. It inherits all properties and methods from `Vehicle` and adds a new property `batteryCapacity`. The `startEngine` method is overridden to provide specific behavior for electric vehicles.

#### Using Subclass Instances

```swift
let myElectricCar = ElectricVehicle(brand: "Tesla", model: "Model S", year: 2021, batteryCapacity: 100)
myElectricCar.startEngine() // Output: Electric engine started for Tesla Model S.
```

The `myElectricCar` object is an instance of `ElectricVehicle`. It has access to properties and methods from both `ElectricVehicle` and `Vehicle`.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of restricting access to certain components of an object and only exposing what is necessary. Swift provides several access control levels to achieve encapsulation.

#### Access Control

Swift's access control model includes five levels: `open`, `public`, `internal`, `fileprivate`, and `private`.

- **Open/Public**: Accessible from any source file in the defining module or any module that imports the defining module.
- **Internal**: Accessible from any source file in the defining module (default access level).
- **Fileprivate**: Accessible from within the same source file.
- **Private**: Accessible only within the enclosing declaration.

```swift
class BankAccount {
    private var balance: Double = 0.0

    func deposit(amount: Double) {
        balance += amount
    }

    func withdraw(amount: Double) -> Bool {
        if amount <= balance {
            balance -= amount
            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }

    func getBalance() -> Double {
        return balance
    }
}
```

In this example, the `balance` property is private, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the `BankAccount` class. Instead, methods like `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance` are provided to interact with the balance safely.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).

#### Method Overriding

Method overriding is a form of polymorphism where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```swift
class SportsCar: Vehicle {
    override func startEngine() {
        print("Sports engine roars to life for \\(brand) \\(model).")
    }
}

let mySportsCar: Vehicle = SportsCar(brand: "Ferrari", model: "488", year: 2020)
mySportsCar.startEngine() // Output: Sports engine roars to life for Ferrari 488.
```

In this example, `mySportsCar` is declared as a `Vehicle` but is instantiated as a `SportsCar`. The overridden `startEngine` method in `SportsCar` is called, demonstrating polymorphism.

#### Protocols and Polymorphism

Protocols in Swift define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. Protocols can be adopted by classes, structs, and enums.

```swift
protocol Drivable {
    func drive()
}

class Truck: Vehicle, Drivable {
    func drive() {
        print("Driving a truck.")
    }
}

let myTruck: Drivable = Truck(brand: "Ford", model: "F-150", year: 2021)
myTruck.drive() // Output: Driving a truck.
```

In this example, `Truck` adopts the `Drivable` protocol, implementing the `drive` method. The `myTruck` object is treated as a `Drivable`, showcasing polymorphism through protocols.

### Visualizing OOP Concepts in Swift

To better understand the relationships and interactions between classes, subclasses, and protocols, let's visualize these concepts using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Vehicle {
        -brand: String
        -model: String
        -year: Int
        +startEngine()
    }
    class ElectricVehicle {
        -batteryCapacity: Int
        +startEngine()
    }
    class SportsCar {
        +startEngine()
    }
    class Truck {
        +drive()
    }
    Vehicle <|-- ElectricVehicle
    Vehicle <|-- SportsCar
    Vehicle <|-- Truck
    class Drivable {
        <<protocol>>
        +drive()
    }
    Truck ..|> Drivable
```

This diagram illustrates the inheritance hierarchy, with `Vehicle` as the superclass and `ElectricVehicle`, `SportsCar`, and `Truck` as subclasses. The `Drivable` protocol is adopted by `Truck`, demonstrating polymorphism through protocol conformance.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of OOP in Swift, try modifying the code examples:

- Add a new subclass `Convertible` with a method `openRoof()`.
- Implement a protocol `Raceable` with a method `race()`, and have `SportsCar` conform to it.
- Experiment with access control by changing the visibility of properties and methods in the `Vehicle` class.
