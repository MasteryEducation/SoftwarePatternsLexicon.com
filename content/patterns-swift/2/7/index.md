## 2.7 Swift's Unique Approach to OOP Concepts

Swift, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language, takes a unique approach to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that distinguishes it from other languages. While Swift embraces traditional OOP principles, it enhances them with modern features that promote flexibility, safety, and performance. In this section, we will delve into Swift's distinctive OOP concepts, such as extensions, computed properties, property observers, and deinitializers, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these features contribute to robust Swift development.

### Extensions: Adding Functionality Without Subclassing

Extensions in Swift allow developers to add new functionality to existing classes, structures, enumerations, and protocols. This capability is particularly powerful as it enables the enhancement of types without the need for subclassing, promoting a more modular and flexible codebase.

#### Understanding Extensions

Extensions can add computed properties, methods, initializers, subscripts, and nested types to existing types. They can also make an existing type conform to a protocol. This feature is invaluable for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle and enhancing code reuse.

#### Code Example: Using Extensions

```swift
// Original class
class Vehicle {
    var speed: Double = 0.0
}

// Extension to add new functionality
extension Vehicle {
    func accelerate(by increment: Double) {
        speed += increment
    }
}

// Usage
let car = Vehicle()
car.accelerate(by: 10.0)
print(car.speed) // Output: 10.0
```

In this example, we extend the `Vehicle` class to include an `accelerate` method, demonstrating how extensions can enhance existing classes without altering their source code.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with extensions by adding a decelerate method to the `Vehicle` class. Consider how you might use extensions to add similar functionality to other types in your projects.

### Computed Properties: Encapsulating Logic Within Properties

Computed properties in Swift allow for the encapsulation of logic within properties, providing a way to calculate a value rather than storing it. This feature enhances encapsulation and reduces redundancy in your code.

#### Understanding Computed Properties

A computed property does not store a value directly. Instead, it provides a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly.

#### Code Example: Computed Properties

```swift
struct Rectangle {
    var width: Double
    var height: Double
    
    // Computed property
    var area: Double {
        return width * height
    }
}

// Usage
let rect = Rectangle(width: 5.0, height: 10.0)
print(rect.area) // Output: 50.0
```

Here, the `area` property is computed based on the `width` and `height` properties, demonstrating how computed properties can simplify calculations and maintain data integrity.

#### Try It Yourself

Create a computed property for the perimeter of the `Rectangle` struct. Consider how computed properties can be used to derive other properties in your applications.

### Property Observers: Responding to Changes in Property Values

Property observers in Swift allow you to monitor and respond to changes in a property's value. This feature is essential for implementing reactive programming patterns and maintaining data consistency.

#### Understanding Property Observers

Swift provides two types of property observers: `willSet` and `didSet`. The `willSet` observer is called just before the value is stored, and `didSet` is called immediately after the new value is stored.

#### Code Example: Property Observers

```swift
class StepCounter {
    var totalSteps: Int = 0 {
        willSet(newTotalSteps) {
            print("About to set totalSteps to \\(newTotalSteps)")
        }
        didSet {
            if totalSteps > oldValue {
                print("Added \\(totalSteps - oldValue) steps")
            }
        }
    }
}

// Usage
let stepCounter = StepCounter()
stepCounter.totalSteps = 200
// Output:
// About to set totalSteps to 200
// Added 200 steps
```

In this example, property observers are used to track changes to the `totalSteps` property, providing feedback on the number of steps added.

#### Try It Yourself

Add a `didSet` observer to a property in one of your classes or structs. Experiment with using `willSet` to validate new values before they are set.

### Deinitializers: Custom Cleanup Before Instance Deallocation

Deinitializers in Swift provide a way to perform custom cleanup just before an instance is deallocated. This feature is crucial for managing resources and ensuring that instances are properly cleaned up.

#### Understanding Deinitializers

A deinitializer is called automatically just before an instance is deallocated. It is defined using the `deinit` keyword and is available only for class types.

#### Code Example: Deinitializers

```swift
class BankAccount {
    var balance: Double
    
    init(balance: Double) {
        self.balance = balance
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("BankAccount with balance \\(balance) is being deallocated")
    }
}

// Usage
var account: BankAccount? = BankAccount(balance: 1000.0)
account = nil
// Output: BankAccount with balance 1000.0 is being deallocated
```

In this example, the `BankAccount` class includes a deinitializer that prints a message when an instance is deallocated, illustrating how deinitializers can be used for cleanup tasks.

#### Try It Yourself

Implement a deinitializer in one of your classes to release resources or perform other cleanup tasks. Consider how deinitializers can help manage memory and resources in your applications.

### Visualizing Swift's OOP Concepts

To better understand how these concepts work together, let's visualize the relationships and interactions between extensions, computed properties, property observers, and deinitializers.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Vehicle {
        +Double speed
        +accelerate(Double)
    }
    class Rectangle {
        +Double width
        +Double height
        +Double area
    }
    class StepCounter {
        +Int totalSteps
    }
    class BankAccount {
        +Double balance
        +deinit()
    }
    Vehicle <|-- Rectangle
    StepCounter <|-- BankAccount
```

This diagram illustrates how extensions can add methods to classes like `Vehicle`, computed properties can be used in structs like `Rectangle`, property observers can monitor changes in classes like `StepCounter`, and deinitializers can perform cleanup in classes like `BankAccount`.
