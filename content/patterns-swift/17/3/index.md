## 17.3 Mocking and Stubbing Dependencies

In the world of software development, testing is a critical component that ensures the reliability and robustness of applications. When it comes to testing in Swift, mocking and stubbing are indispensable techniques that help isolate units of code, enabling developers to test components in isolation. This section will guide you through the concepts of mocking and stubbing, demonstrate how to implement protocol-oriented mocking, and explore the use of third-party libraries like Cuckoo and Mockingbird.

### Understanding Mocking and Stubbing

Before diving into implementation, let's clarify the concepts of mocking and stubbing:

- **Mocking** involves creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. Mocks are used to verify interactions between objects, such as method calls and their parameters.
- **Stubbing** refers to providing predefined responses to method calls. Stubs are used to replace parts of the system that are not under test, allowing you to control the environment and test specific behaviors.

### Why Use Mocking and Stubbing?

Mocking and stubbing offer several benefits:

- **Isolation**: By isolating the unit of code under test, you can focus on testing its logic without interference from external dependencies.
- **Control**: You can control the behavior of dependencies, making it easier to test edge cases and error handling.
- **Speed**: Tests run faster because they do not rely on real implementations, such as network requests or database access.
- **Reliability**: Tests become more reliable as they are not affected by external factors, such as network latency or service availability.

### Implementing Protocol-Oriented Mocking

Swift's emphasis on protocol-oriented programming (POP) makes it an ideal language for mocking. By defining protocols for dependencies, you can easily create mock implementations for testing.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Protocol-Oriented Mocking

1. **Define Protocols for Dependencies**

   Start by defining protocols for the dependencies you want to mock. For example, if you have a `NetworkService` class, define a `NetworkServiceProtocol`:

   ```swift
   protocol NetworkServiceProtocol {
       func fetchData(from url: URL, completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)
   }
   ```

2. **Create Mock Implementations**

   Implement mock versions of these protocols. For instance, create a `MockNetworkService`:

   ```swift
   class MockNetworkService: NetworkServiceProtocol {
       var fetchDataCalled = false
       var resultToReturn: Result<Data, Error>?

       func fetchData(from url: URL, completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void) {
           fetchDataCalled = true
           if let result = resultToReturn {
               completion(result)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, `fetchDataCalled` tracks whether the method was called, and `resultToReturn` allows you to specify the result to return.

3. **Inject Dependencies**

   Use dependency injection to provide the mock implementation to the unit under test. This can be done through initializer injection, property injection, or method injection.

   ```swift
   class DataManager {
       private let networkService: NetworkServiceProtocol

       init(networkService: NetworkServiceProtocol) {
           self.networkService = networkService
       }

       func loadData(completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void) {
           let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/data")!
           networkService.fetchData(from: url, completion: completion)
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Write Tests Using Mocks**

   Now, you can write tests that use the mock implementations. For example, test that `loadData` calls `fetchData`:

   ```swift
   import XCTest

   class DataManagerTests: XCTestCase {
       func testLoadDataCallsFetchData() {
           let mockNetworkService = MockNetworkService()
           let dataManager = DataManager(networkService: mockNetworkService)

           dataManager.loadData { _ in }

           XCTAssertTrue(mockNetworkService.fetchDataCalled)
       }
   }
   ```

### Using Third-Party Libraries

While protocol-oriented mocking is powerful, third-party libraries can simplify the process, especially for more complex scenarios. Two popular libraries in the Swift ecosystem are Cuckoo and Mockingbird.

#### Cuckoo

Cuckoo is a mocking framework that generates mock classes based on your protocols and classes. It provides a simple and expressive API for defining mock behavior and verifying interactions.

1. **Setup Cuckoo**

   Add Cuckoo to your project using Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.

   ```swift
   dependencies: [
       .package(url: "https://github.com/Brightify/Cuckoo.git", from: "1.0.0")
   ]
   ```

2. **Generate Mocks**

   Use Cuckoo's command-line tool to generate mock classes. This tool reads your source files and creates mock implementations.

   ```bash
   ./Scripts/generateMocks.sh
   ```

3. **Write Tests with Cuckoo**

   Use the generated mocks in your tests. Here's an example:

   ```swift
   import Cuckoo
   import XCTest

   class DataManagerTests: XCTestCase {
       func testLoadDataCallsFetchData() {
           let mockNetworkService = MockNetworkServiceProtocol()
           stub(mockNetworkService) { stub in
               when(stub.fetchData(from: any(), completion: any())).thenDoNothing()
           }

           let dataManager = DataManager(networkService: mockNetworkService)

           dataManager.loadData { _ in }

           verify(mockNetworkService).fetchData(from: any(), completion: any())
       }
   }
   ```

   Cuckoo's `stub` and `verify` functions make it easy to define expected behavior and verify interactions.

#### Mockingbird

Mockingbird is another powerful library for mocking in Swift. It focuses on simplicity and ease of use, providing a clean API for creating mocks and stubs.

1. **Setup Mockingbird**

   Add Mockingbird to your project using Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.

   ```swift
   dependencies: [
       .package(url: "https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird.git", from: "0.18.0")
   ]
   ```

2. **Generate Mocks**

   Use Mockingbird's command-line tool to generate mocks from your protocols.

   ```bash
   mockingbird generate
   ```

3. **Write Tests with Mockingbird**

   Here's an example of using Mockingbird in tests:

   ```swift
   import Mockingbird
   import XCTest

   class DataManagerTests: XCTestCase {
       func testLoadDataCallsFetchData() {
           let mockNetworkService = mock(NetworkServiceProtocol.self)
           given(mockNetworkService.fetchData(from: any(), completion: any())).willReturn()

           let dataManager = DataManager(networkService: mockNetworkService)

           dataManager.loadData { _ in }

           verify(mockNetworkService.fetchData(from: any(), completion: any())).wasCalled()
       }
   }
   ```

   Mockingbird's `given` and `verify` functions provide a straightforward way to define and verify mock behavior.

### Visualizing Mocking and Stubbing

To better understand the process of mocking and stubbing, let's visualize the flow of a typical test using these techniques.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Test as Test Case
    participant Mock as Mock Object
    participant SUT as System Under Test
    participant Dependency as Real Dependency

    Test->>Mock: Create Mock
    Test->>SUT: Inject Mock
    SUT->>Mock: Call Method
    Mock->>SUT: Return Stubbed Response
    Test->>Mock: Verify Interaction
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a test case, a mock object, the system under test (SUT), and the real dependency. The test case creates a mock, injects it into the SUT, and verifies the interaction.

### Best Practices for Mocking and Stubbing

- **Keep Mocks Simple**: Avoid adding unnecessary logic to mocks. They should be simple and focused on simulating behavior.
- **Use Protocols**: Define protocols for dependencies to facilitate mocking. This promotes decoupling and testability.
- **Verify Interactions**: Use mocks to verify that the SUT interacts with dependencies as expected.
- **Stub Responses**: Use stubs to control the environment and test specific scenarios.
- **Avoid Over-Mocking**: Mocking everything can lead to brittle tests. Focus on mocking external dependencies.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided in this section. Try modifying the mock implementations to simulate different scenarios, such as network errors or specific data responses. This hands-on practice will deepen your understanding of mocking and stubbing in Swift.

### Knowledge Check
