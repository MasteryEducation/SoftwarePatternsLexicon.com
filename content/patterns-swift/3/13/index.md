## 3.13 Property Wrappers

In Swift, property wrappers provide a powerful mechanism to encapsulate property-related logic, making your code more modular, reusable, and expressive. This section will delve into the purpose of property wrappers, explore built-in wrappers like `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@Published`, and guide you through creating custom property wrappers for your specific needs.

### Purpose of Property Wrappers

Property wrappers in Swift allow you to define a common behavior for a property that can be reused across different properties. They are essentially a way to encapsulate the logic that is typically associated with getting and setting a property, such as validation, transformation, or providing default values.

#### Key Benefits:

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate repetitive property logic in one place.
- **Reusability**: Reuse property logic across different properties and projects.
- **Readability**: Improve code readability by abstracting complex logic.
- **Maintainability**: Simplify maintenance by centralizing property logic.

### Built-in Wrappers

Swift provides several built-in property wrappers, especially useful in SwiftUI for state management and data binding. Let's explore some of the most common built-in wrappers.

#### @State

The `@State` property wrapper is used in SwiftUI to manage the state of a view. It allows you to create a source of truth for a piece of data that the view depends on, ensuring that the view updates whenever the state changes.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct CounterView: View {
    @State private var count: Int = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Count: \\(count)")
            Button("Increment") {
                count += 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@State` property wrapper is used to manage the `count` variable. Whenever `count` changes, the view automatically updates to reflect the new value.

#### @Binding

The `@Binding` property wrapper is used to create a two-way connection between a parent view and a child view. It allows the child view to read and write a value that is owned by the parent view.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isOn: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ToggleView(isOn: $isOn)
    }
}

struct ToggleView: View {
    @Binding var isOn: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Toggle", isOn: $isOn)
    }
}
```

Here, `@Binding` is used in `ToggleView` to bind the `isOn` property to the `isOn` state in `ContentView`. This allows changes in the toggle to be reflected in `ContentView`.

#### @Published

The `@Published` property wrapper is used in conjunction with `ObservableObject` to notify views of changes to a property. It's commonly used in the MVVM pattern to update views when the model changes.

```swift
import Combine

class UserData: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username: String = ""
}

struct UserView: View {
    @ObservedObject var userData = UserData()

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Username", text: $userData.username)
    }
}
```

In this example, `@Published` is used to automatically notify any observers when `username` changes, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the data model.

### Creating Custom Property Wrappers

Creating custom property wrappers allows you to encapsulate reusable logic specific to your application's needs. Let's explore how to define a custom property wrapper.

#### Defining a Custom Property Wrapper

To create a custom property wrapper, define a struct or class with a `wrappedValue` property and a `projectedValue` if needed. Here's a simple example of a property wrapper that clamps a value within a specified range.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Clamped<Value: Comparable> {
    var value: Value
    let range: ClosedRange<Value>

    var wrappedValue: Value {
        get { return value }
        set { value = min(max(range.lowerBound, newValue), range.upperBound) }
    }

    init(wrappedValue: Value, _ range: ClosedRange<Value>) {
        self.range = range
        self.value = min(max(range.lowerBound, wrappedValue), range.upperBound)
    }
}

struct Settings {
    @Clamped(0...100) var volume: Int = 50
}

var settings = Settings()
settings.volume = 150
print(settings.volume) // Outputs: 100
```

In this example, the `Clamped` property wrapper ensures that the `volume` property is always within the range 0 to 100.

#### Projected Values

Property wrappers can also provide a projected value, which is accessed using the `$` prefix. This is useful for exposing additional functionality or information.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Logger<Value> {
    private var value: Value

    var wrappedValue: Value {
        get { return value }
        set {
            print("Setting value to \\(newValue)")
            value = newValue
        }
    }

    var projectedValue: Logger {
        return self
    }

    init(wrappedValue: Value) {
        self.value = wrappedValue
    }

    func log() {
        print("Current value is \\(value)")
    }
}

struct Example {
    @Logger var value: Int = 0
}

var example = Example()
example.value = 10
example.$value.log() // Outputs: Current value is 10
```

The `Logger` property wrapper logs changes to the property and provides a `log()` method via its projected value.

### Use Cases for Property Wrappers

Property wrappers can be used in a variety of scenarios to simplify and enhance your codebase. Here are some common use cases:

- **Validation**: Enforce constraints or validate data before setting a property.
- **Caching**: Implement lazy loading or caching mechanisms.
- **Transformation**: Automatically transform data when getting or setting a property.
- **Configuration**: Manage configuration settings with default values and constraints.

### Visualizing Property Wrappers

To better understand how property wrappers work, let's visualize the flow of data when using a property wrapper in Swift.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Property Wrapper] --> B[wrappedValue]
    A --> C[projectedValue]
    B --> D[Get/Set Property]
    C --> E[Additional Functionality]
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the property wrapper, its `wrappedValue`, and `projectedValue`. The `wrappedValue` is used to get and set the property, while the `projectedValue` provides additional functionality.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided examples by modifying the property wrappers to add new features or constraints. For instance, try creating a property wrapper that logs changes only when the new value differs from the old value.
