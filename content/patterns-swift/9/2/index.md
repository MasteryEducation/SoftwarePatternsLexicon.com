## 9.2 Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) Basics

Concurrency is a cornerstone of modern software development, enabling applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In Swift, Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is a powerful tool for managing concurrency, allowing developers to execute tasks efficiently in the background while keeping the user interface responsive. In this section, we will delve into the basics of GCD, exploring its components, usage, and practical applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of using GCD is to manage background tasks efficiently. By leveraging GCD, developers can ensure that tasks are executed concurrently without blocking the main thread, which is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience.

### Implementing GCD in Swift

#### Dispatch Queues

Dispatch queues are the backbone of GCD, providing a mechanism to execute tasks asynchronously or synchronously. There are three main types of dispatch queues:

1. **Main Queue**: This is the serial queue that runs on the main thread. It is used for updating the UI and handling user interactions. Since UI updates must occur on the main thread, tasks that affect the UI should be dispatched to this queue.

2. **Global Queues**: These are concurrent queues provided by the system, categorized by different quality of service (QoS) levels. They are used for executing tasks in the background.

3. **Custom Queues**: Developers can create their own serial or concurrent queues to manage specific tasks.

##### Code Example: Creating and Using Dispatch Queues

```swift
// Main Queue
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    // Code to update UI
    self.updateUI()
}

// Global Queue
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
    // Background task
    self.performBackgroundTask()
}

// Custom Serial Queue
let customSerialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.serialQueue")
customSerialQueue.sync {
    // Serial task execution
    self.executeSerialTask()
}

// Custom Concurrent Queue
let customConcurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.concurrentQueue", attributes: .concurrent)
customConcurrentQueue.async {
    // Concurrent task execution
    self.executeConcurrentTask()
}
```

#### Asynchronous and Synchronous Tasks

Understanding the difference between asynchronous (`async`) and synchronous (`sync`) tasks is crucial for effective concurrency management:

- **Asynchronous (`async`)**: Tasks are dispatched and executed without blocking the current thread. The program continues executing subsequent code while the task runs in the background.

- **Synchronous (`sync`)**: The current thread is blocked until the task completes. This is useful when a task must be completed before proceeding.

##### Code Example: Async vs. Sync

```swift
// Asynchronous Task
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    // Perform background task
    self.performBackgroundTask()
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Update UI after task completion
        self.updateUI()
    }
}

// Synchronous Task
DispatchQueue.global().sync {
    // Perform task and wait for completion
    self.performSynchronousTask()
}
```

#### Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS allows developers to prioritize tasks based on their importance and impact on the user experience. The available QoS classes are:

- `.userInteractive`: Highest priority, for tasks that affect the UI directly.
- `.userInitiated`: High priority, for tasks initiated by the user.
- `.default`: Normal priority, for tasks that do not require immediate attention.
- `.utility`: Low priority, for long-running tasks.
- `.background`: Lowest priority, for tasks that are not time-sensitive.

##### Code Example: Using QoS

```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
    // High-priority task
    self.performHighPriorityTask()
}
```

#### Dispatch Work Items

Dispatch Work Items provide a way to encapsulate a task that can be executed on a dispatch queue. They offer additional control over task execution, such as cancellation or delaying.

##### Code Example: Dispatch Work Items

```swift
// Create a Dispatch Work Item
let workItem = DispatchWorkItem {
    // Task to be executed
    self.performTask()
}

// Execute the work item on a global queue
DispatchQueue.global().async(execute: workItem)

// Cancel the work item if needed
workItem.cancel()
```

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Background Processing

GCD is ideal for executing tasks that can run in the background, such as image processing or data parsing. By offloading these tasks to a background queue, the main thread remains free to handle user interactions.

##### Code Example: Background Image Processing

```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
    let processedImage = self.processImage(image)
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.imageView.image = processedImage
    }
}
```

#### UI Updates

Ensuring that UI updates occur on the main thread is critical for maintaining a responsive user interface. GCD makes it easy to dispatch UI-related tasks to the main queue.

##### Code Example: Updating UI on Main Thread

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    self.label.text = "Task Completed"
}
```

#### Synchronization

GCD can help prevent race conditions by synchronizing access to shared resources. This is particularly important in concurrent programming where multiple threads may attempt to modify the same data simultaneously.

##### Code Example: Synchronizing Access to Shared Resource

```swift
let serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.serialQueue")

serialQueue.sync {
    // Access shared resource safely
    self.sharedResource.modify()
}
```

### Visualizing GCD Concepts

To better understand how GCD operates, let's visualize the interaction between different dispatch queues and tasks using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MainQueue
    participant GlobalQueue
    participant CustomQueue

    MainQueue->>GlobalQueue: Dispatch async task
    GlobalQueue-->>MainQueue: Task completion callback
    MainQueue->>CustomQueue: Dispatch sync task
    CustomQueue-->>MainQueue: Task completion
```
