## 10.1 Introduction to Functional Programming in Swift

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. In Swift, functional programming principles can be leveraged to write more predictable, maintainable, and testable code. This section introduces the core concepts of functional programming in Swift and demonstrates how to apply them effectively.

### Intent

The intent of this section is to provide an overview of functional programming principles and how to apply them in Swift to write clear and maintainable code.

### Core Concepts

#### Pure Functions

Pure functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming. A pure function is a function where the output value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This means that calling a pure function with the same arguments will always produce the same result.

**Characteristics of Pure Functions:**

- **Deterministic**: Always produces the same output for the same input.
- **No Side Effects**: Does not modify any external state or interact with external systems.

**Example of a Pure Function in Swift:**

```swift
// A pure function that calculates the square of a number
func square(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    return number * number
}

// Usage
let result = square(4) // Always returns 16
```

In this example, the `square` function is pure because it performs a calculation based solely on its input and does not modify any external state.

#### Immutability

Immutability is another core principle of functional programming. It involves using data structures that cannot be modified after they are created. Instead of changing an object, you create a new one with the desired changes.

**Benefits of Immutability:**

- **Predictability**: Easier to reason about code behavior.
- **Concurrency**: Reduces state-related bugs in concurrent environments.
- **Testability**: Immutable data structures are easier to test.

**Example of Immutability in Swift:**

```swift
// Immutable struct
struct Point {
    let x: Int
    let y: Int
}

// Creating an immutable instance
let point = Point(x: 1, y: 2)

// Attempting to modify will result in a compile-time error
// point.x = 3 // Error: Cannot assign to property: 'x' is a 'let' constant
```

In Swift, you can achieve immutability by using `let` to declare constants and using immutable data structures like structs.

#### First-Class Functions

In Swift, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This allows for higher-order functions and function composition.

**Example of First-Class Functions in Swift:**

```swift
// Function that takes another function as a parameter
func applyOperation(_ a: Int, _ b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int) -> Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

// Usage with a closure
let sum = applyOperation(3, 4, operation: { $0 + $1 }) // Returns 7
```

In this example, `applyOperation` is a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument, demonstrating the first-class nature of functions in Swift.

#### Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. This allows for building complex operations from simpler ones, leading to more modular and reusable code.

**Example of Function Composition in Swift:**

```swift
// Define simple functions
func add(_ x: Int, _ y: Int) -> Int {
    return x + y
}

func multiply(_ x: Int, _ y: Int) -> Int {
    return x * y
}

// Compose functions
func addThenMultiply(_ a: Int, _ b: Int, _ c: Int) -> Int {
    let sum = add(a, b)
    return multiply(sum, c)
}

// Usage
let result = addThenMultiply(2, 3, 4) // Returns 20
```

In this example, `addThenMultiply` composes the `add` and `multiply` functions to create a new function that first adds two numbers and then multiplies the result by a third number.

### Use Cases and Examples

Functional programming in Swift is not just theoretical; it has practical applications that can significantly improve your code.

#### Predictability

By using pure functions and immutability, you can make your code more predictable. This predictability makes it easier to understand and reason about, which is particularly valuable in large codebases.

**Example:**

Consider a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart. By ensuring the function is pure and the cart is immutable, you can guarantee consistent results.

```swift
struct Item {
    let price: Double
}

func totalPrice(of items: [Item]) -> Double {
    return items.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.price }
}

// Usage
let items = [Item(price: 10.0), Item(price: 20.0)]
let total = totalPrice(of: items) // Always returns 30.0
```

#### Concurrency

Functional programming principles help reduce state-related bugs in concurrent environments. By minimizing shared mutable state, you can write safer concurrent code.

**Example:**

When working with concurrent tasks, using immutable data structures ensures that tasks do not interfere with each other.

```swift
import Foundation

let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.myqueue", attributes: .concurrent)

struct Counter {
    let count: Int
}

func increment(counter: Counter) -> Counter {
    return Counter(count: counter.count + 1)
}

var counter = Counter(count: 0)

queue.async {
    counter = increment(counter: counter)
}

queue.async {
    counter = increment(counter: counter)
}

// Wait for tasks to complete
queue.sync(flags: .barrier) {}

// Counter is safely incremented
print(counter.count)
```

#### Testability

Pure functions and immutable data structures are inherently easier to test because they do not depend on or alter external state.

**Example:**

Testing a pure function involves simply asserting that it returns the expected output for given inputs.

```swift
import XCTest

class MathTests: XCTestCase {
    func testSquare() {
        XCTAssertEqual(square(2), 4)
        XCTAssertEqual(square(-2), 4)
        XCTAssertEqual(square(0), 0)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `testSquare` function tests the `square` function, verifying that it produces the correct output for various inputs.

### Visualizing Functional Programming Concepts

To better understand how functional programming concepts fit together, let's visualize the relationships between them using a diagram.

```mermaid

    A[Functional Programming] --> B[Pure Functions];
    A --> C[Immutability];
    A --> D[First-Class Functions];
    A --> E[Function Composition];
    B --> F[Predictability];
    C --> G[Concurrency];
    D --> H[Testability];
    E --> I[Modularity];
```

**Diagram Description:** This diagram illustrates the core concepts of functional programming and their relationships. Pure functions lead to predictability, immutability aids concurrency, first-class functions enhance testability, and function composition promotes modularity.
