## 10.9 Lazy Evaluation and Sequences

In the realm of functional programming, lazy evaluation is a powerful concept that allows us to defer computation until it's absolutely necessary. This strategy can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large data sets or resource-intensive operations. In this section, we will delve into the world of lazy evaluation and sequences in Swift, exploring how they can be harnessed to create efficient, scalable applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of lazy evaluation is to improve performance by postponing computations until their results are required. This can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where not all data is needed, or when working with infinite sequences. By understanding and implementing lazy evaluation, we can optimize resource usage and enhance the responsiveness of our applications.

### Implementing Lazy Sequences

#### The `lazy` Keyword

Swift provides a built-in way to implement lazy evaluation in collections through the `lazy` keyword. When applied to a collection, it transforms the collection into a lazy sequence, deferring computations until the elements are accessed.

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let lazyNumbers = numbers.lazy.map { $0 * 2 }

// Computation happens here, when elements are accessed
for number in lazyNumbers {
    print(number)
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the `map` operation is deferred until the elements of `lazyNumbers` are accessed in the loop. This can save computation time and resources when dealing with large collections.

#### Custom Lazy Sequences

To create custom lazy sequences, we need to implement the `Sequence` and `IteratorProtocol` protocols. This allows us to define how elements are generated and accessed lazily.

```swift
struct FibonacciSequence: Sequence {
    func makeIterator() -> FibonacciIterator {
        return FibonacciIterator()
    }
}

struct FibonacciIterator: IteratorProtocol {
    private var current = 0
    private var nextValue = 1

    mutating func next() -> Int? {
        let result = current
        current = nextValue
        nextValue = result + nextValue
        return result
    }
}

let fibonacci = FibonacciSequence().lazy.prefix(10)
for number in fibonacci {
    print(number)
}
```

**Explanation**: Here, we define a `FibonacciSequence` that generates Fibonacci numbers lazily. The `FibonacciIterator` handles the logic for generating the sequence. The use of `lazy` and `prefix` ensures that only the first 10 numbers are computed.

#### Infinite Sequences

Infinite sequences are sequences that can generate values indefinitely. They are particularly useful in scenarios where data is processed as it becomes available, such as streaming data.

```swift
struct InfiniteSequence: Sequence {
    func makeIterator() -> InfiniteIterator {
        return InfiniteIterator()
    }
}

struct InfiniteIterator: IteratorProtocol {
    private var current = 0

    mutating func next() -> Int? {
        defer { current += 1 }
        return current
    }
}

let infiniteNumbers = InfiniteSequence().lazy
for number in infiniteNumbers.prefix(5) {
    print(number)
}
```

**Explanation**: The `InfiniteSequence` generates an infinite sequence of integers. By using `lazy` and `prefix`, we can limit the number of elements processed, preventing an infinite loop.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Performance Optimization

Lazy evaluation can significantly enhance performance by avoiding unnecessary computations. Consider a scenario where we need to filter and map a large array:

```swift
let largeArray = Array(1...1000000)
let lazyFilteredArray = largeArray.lazy.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.map { $0 * 2 }

for number in lazyFilteredArray.prefix(10) {
    print(number)
}
```

**Explanation**: By using `lazy`, the filter and map operations are deferred, and only the necessary elements are processed. This reduces the computational overhead, especially with large datasets.

#### Data Streaming

Lazy sequences are ideal for data streaming, where data is processed as it becomes available. This approach is common in network operations or real-time data processing.

```swift
func streamData() -> AnySequence<Int> {
    return AnySequence { () -> AnyIterator<Int> in
        var current = 0
        return AnyIterator {
            defer { current += 1 }
            return current < 100 ? current : nil
        }
    }
}

let dataStream = streamData().lazy
for data in dataStream {
    print(data)
}
```

**Explanation**: The `streamData` function generates a sequence of data lazily, simulating a data stream. The sequence processes data as it becomes available, making it suitable for real-time applications.

#### Resource Management

Lazy evaluation can help manage resources more efficiently by reducing memory usage. When computations are deferred, memory is only allocated for elements that are actually needed.

```swift
let largeDataSet = Array(repeating: "Data", count: 1000000)
let lazyDataSet = largeDataSet.lazy.filter { $0 == "Data" }

for data in lazyDataSet.prefix(5) {
    print(data)
}
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the lazy filter operation ensures that only the necessary elements are processed, reducing the memory footprint of the application.

### Visualizing Lazy Evaluation

To better understand how lazy evaluation works, let's visualize the process using a flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is element needed?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Compute element]
    B -- No --> D[Skip computation]
    C --> E[Next element]
    D --> E
    E --> B
    E --> F[End]
```

**Description**: This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process in lazy evaluation. Elements are only computed if they are needed, otherwise, the computation is skipped, optimizing resource usage.
