## 22.4 Common Interview Questions on Design Patterns

In technical interviews, design patterns are a frequent topic, especially for roles involving software architecture and development in Swift. Understanding these patterns not only demonstrates your technical proficiency but also your ability to apply best practices in software design. This section will cover common interview questions on design patterns, provide sample answers, and offer tips for effectively communicating your understanding.

### 1. What is a Design Pattern, and Why is it Important?

**Sample Answer:**  
A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in software design. It is a template or blueprint that can be applied to various situations in software development to solve problems efficiently. Design patterns are important because they provide proven solutions, improve code readability, and facilitate communication among developers by providing a common language.

**Explanation:**  
When discussing design patterns, emphasize their role in improving code maintainability and scalability. Highlight how they help in avoiding common pitfalls and encourage best practices.

### 2. Can You Explain the Singleton Design Pattern and Its Use Cases?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used in scenarios where a single point of control is needed, such as managing a shared resource like a configuration object or a connection pool.

**Code Example:**

```swift
class Singleton {
    static let shared = Singleton()

    private init() {
        // Private initialization to ensure just one instance is created.
    }

    func doSomething() {
        print("Singleton is doing something.")
    }
}

// Usage
Singleton.shared.doSomething()
```

**Explanation:**  
In Swift, the Singleton pattern is implemented using a static constant. This ensures thread safety and lazy initialization. Discuss scenarios where Singleton is beneficial, but also mention its potential downsides, such as difficulty in unit testing and tight coupling.

### 3. How Does the Factory Method Pattern Differ from the Abstract Factory Pattern?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Code Example for Factory Method:**

```swift
protocol Product {
    func use()
}

class ConcreteProductA: Product {
    func use() {
        print("Using Product A")
    }
}

class Creator {
    func factoryMethod() -> Product {
        return ConcreteProductA()
    }
}

// Usage
let creator = Creator()
let product = creator.factoryMethod()
product.use()
```

**Explanation:**  
Highlight the flexibility provided by the Factory Method pattern in allowing subclasses to choose the type of objects to create. Contrast this with the Abstract Factory pattern, which is used to create families of related objects, emphasizing their independence from concrete implementations.

### 4. What is the Observer Pattern, and How is it Implemented in Swift?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. In Swift, this can be implemented using protocols and delegates or with Combine for reactive programming.

**Code Example with Combine:**

```swift
import Combine

class Publisher {
    var didChange = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

    func update(value: String) {
        didChange.send(value)
    }
}

class Subscriber {
    var subscription: AnyCancellable?

    init(publisher: Publisher) {
        subscription = publisher.didChange.sink { value in
            print("Received value: \\(value)")
        }
    }
}

// Usage
let publisher = Publisher()
let subscriber = Subscriber(publisher: publisher)
publisher.update(value: "Hello, Observer!")
```

**Explanation:**  
Explain the concept of observers and subjects, and how Swift's Combine framework simplifies the implementation of the Observer pattern. Discuss the benefits of using Combine for handling asynchronous events and data streams.

### 5. Describe the Strategy Pattern and Provide a Use Case.

**Sample Answer:**  
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. A common use case is implementing different sorting algorithms that can be selected at runtime.

**Code Example:**

```swift
protocol SortingStrategy {
    func sort(_ array: [Int]) -> [Int]
}

class QuickSort: SortingStrategy {
    func sort(_ array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        // Implementation of quicksort algorithm
        return array.sorted()
    }
}

class BubbleSort: SortingStrategy {
    func sort(_ array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        // Implementation of bubble sort algorithm
        return array.sorted()
    }
}

class Context {
    private var strategy: SortingStrategy

    init(strategy: SortingStrategy) {
        self.strategy = strategy
    }

    func executeStrategy(array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        return strategy.sort(array)
    }
}

// Usage
let context = Context(strategy: QuickSort())
let sortedArray = context.executeStrategy(array: [3, 1, 2])
print(sortedArray)
```

**Explanation:**  
Discuss how the Strategy pattern promotes flexibility and reusability by allowing the client to choose different algorithms at runtime. Mention its applicability in scenarios requiring dynamic algorithm selection.

### 6. What is the Decorator Pattern, and How Does It Enhance Functionality?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. This pattern is useful when you need to add behavior to objects without modifying their code.

**Code Example:**

```swift
protocol Coffee {
    func cost() -> Double
    func description() -> String
}

class SimpleCoffee: Coffee {
    func cost() -> Double {
        return 2.0
    }

    func description() -> String {
        return "Simple Coffee"
    }
}

class MilkDecorator: Coffee {
    private let decoratedCoffee: Coffee

    init(decoratedCoffee: Coffee) {
        self.decoratedCoffee = decoratedCoffee
    }

    func cost() -> Double {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost() + 0.5
    }

    func description() -> String {
        return decoratedCoffee.description() + ", Milk"
    }
}

// Usage
let coffee = SimpleCoffee()
let milkCoffee = MilkDecorator(decoratedCoffee: coffee)
print(milkCoffee.description()) // Simple Coffee, Milk
print(milkCoffee.cost()) // 2.5
```

**Explanation:**  
Explain how the Decorator pattern allows for adding responsibilities to objects without altering their structure. Highlight its use in scenarios where extending functionality through inheritance would lead to an explosion of subclasses.

### 7. Can You Explain the Command Pattern and Its Benefits?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations. This pattern is beneficial in implementing transactional behavior and undo mechanisms.

**Code Example:**

```swift
protocol Command {
    func execute()
}

class Light {
    func on() {
        print("Light is on")
    }

    func off() {
        print("Light is off")
    }
}

class LightOnCommand: Command {
    private let light: Light

    init(light: Light) {
        self.light = light
    }

    func execute() {
        light.on()
    }
}

class RemoteControl {
    private var command: Command?

    func setCommand(command: Command) {
        self.command = command
    }

    func pressButton() {
        command?.execute()
    }
}

// Usage
let light = Light()
let lightOnCommand = LightOnCommand(light: light)
let remote = RemoteControl()
remote.setCommand(command: lightOnCommand)
remote.pressButton()
```

**Explanation:**  
Discuss how the Command pattern decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it. Highlight its use in implementing undoable actions and queuing requests.

### 8. What is the Role of the Adapter Pattern in Software Design?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating new components into an existing system.

**Code Example:**

```swift
protocol Target {
    func request()
}

class Adaptee {
    func specificRequest() {
        print("Specific request")
    }
}

class Adapter: Target {
    private let adaptee: Adaptee

    init(adaptee: Adaptee) {
        self.adaptee = adaptee
    }

    func request() {
        adaptee.specificRequest()
    }
}

// Usage
let adaptee = Adaptee()
let adapter = Adapter(adaptee: adaptee)
adapter.request()
```

**Explanation:**  
Explain how the Adapter pattern is used to make incompatible interfaces compatible. Discuss its role in legacy system integration and third-party library usage.

### 9. How Does the MVC Pattern Facilitate Separation of Concerns?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps manage complexity by dividing responsibilities, making the application easier to manage and scale.

**Code Example:**

```swift
class Model {
    var data: String = "Hello, MVC!"
}

class View {
    func display(data: String) {
        print("Displaying: \\(data)")
    }
}

class Controller {
    private let model: Model
    private let view: View

    init(model: Model, view: View) {
        self.model = model
        self.view = view
    }

    func updateView() {
        view.display(data: model.data)
    }
}

// Usage
let model = Model()
let view = View()
let controller = Controller(model: model, view: view)
controller.updateView()
```

**Explanation:**  
Discuss how MVC promotes separation of concerns by dividing the application into distinct components with specific responsibilities. Highlight its benefits in terms of maintainability and scalability.

### 10. What is the Difference Between the Proxy and Decorator Patterns?

**Sample Answer:**  
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The Decorator pattern, on the other hand, adds behavior to an object dynamically. While both patterns involve composition, their intents are different: Proxy focuses on controlling access, while Decorator focuses on adding functionality.

**Code Example for Proxy:**

```swift
protocol Image {
    func display()
}

class RealImage: Image {
    private let filename: String

    init(filename: String) {
        self.filename = filename
        loadFromDisk()
    }

    func display() {
        print("Displaying \\(filename)")
    }

    private func loadFromDisk() {
        print("Loading \\(filename)")
    }
}

class ProxyImage: Image {
    private let filename: String
    private var realImage: RealImage?

    init(filename: String) {
        self.filename = filename
    }

    func display() {
        if realImage == nil {
            realImage = RealImage(filename: filename)
        }
        realImage?.display()
    }
}

// Usage
let image = ProxyImage(filename: "test.jpg")
image.display() // Loading test.jpg and Displaying test.jpg
image.display() // Displaying test.jpg
```

**Explanation:**  
Clarify the distinct purposes of the Proxy and Decorator patterns. Emphasize how Proxy is used for access control, while Decorator is used for extending functionality.
