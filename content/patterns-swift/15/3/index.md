## 15.3 Protecting Sensitive Data

In today's digital age, protecting sensitive data is paramount. As Swift developers, we must ensure that our applications handle data securely, safeguarding it from unauthorized access and breaches. This section delves into various strategies for protecting sensitive data, focusing on encryption, anonymization, and secure data handling.

### Data Encryption

Encryption is a cornerstone of data security, transforming readable data into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. Let's explore how we can encrypt data at rest and in transit in Swift applications.

#### Encrypting Data at Rest

Data at rest refers to data stored on a device or server. Encrypting this data ensures that even if unauthorized parties gain access to the storage medium, they cannot read the data without the decryption key.

**Steps to Encrypt Data at Rest:**

1. **Choose an Encryption Algorithm**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is widely used due to its balance of security and performance.
2. **Generate a Secure Key**: Use a secure method to generate and store encryption keys.
3. **Encrypt Data**: Use the chosen algorithm and key to encrypt data before storing it.

**Swift Code Example for AES Encryption:**

```swift
import CommonCrypto

func aesEncrypt(data: Data, key: Data) throws -> Data {
    var numBytesEncrypted: size_t = 0
    let bufferSize: size_t = data.count + kCCBlockSizeAES128
    var buffer = Data(count: bufferSize)

    let cryptStatus = buffer.withUnsafeMutableBytes { bufferBytes in
        data.withUnsafeBytes { dataBytes in
            key.withUnsafeBytes { keyBytes in
                CCCrypt(
                    CCOperation(kCCEncrypt),
                    CCAlgorithm(kCCAlgorithmAES),
                    CCOptions(kCCOptionPKCS7Padding),
                    keyBytes.baseAddress, kCCKeySizeAES256,
                    nil,
                    dataBytes.baseAddress, data.count,
                    bufferBytes.baseAddress, bufferSize,
                    &numBytesEncrypted
                )
            }
        }
    }

    guard cryptStatus == kCCSuccess else {
        throw NSError(domain: "EncryptionError", code: cryptStatus, userInfo: nil)
    }

    return buffer.prefix(numBytesEncrypted)
}
```

**Key Considerations:**

- **Key Management**: Securely store and manage encryption keys, possibly using Apple's Keychain Services.
- **Performance**: Consider the performance impact of encryption, especially for large datasets.

#### Encrypting Data in Transit

Data in transit refers to data being transferred across networks. Encrypting this data prevents interception and eavesdropping.

**Steps to Encrypt Data in Transit:**

1. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all network communications use HTTPS, which encrypts data using SSL/TLS.
2. **Validate Certificates**: Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. **Use Secure Protocols**: Prefer secure protocols like TLS 1.2 or higher.

**Swift Code Example for HTTPS Requests:**

```swift
import Foundation

func performSecureRequest(url: URL) {
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "GET"

    let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)
    let task = session.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
        if let error = error {
            print("Request failed with error: \\(error)")
            return
        }

        guard let data = data else {
            print("No data received")
            return
        }

        // Process the received data
        print("Data received: \\(data)")
    }

    task.resume()
}
```

**Key Considerations:**

- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Ensure your server supports strong encryption protocols and ciphers.
- **Certificate Validation**: Regularly update and validate SSL/TLS certificates.

### Data Anonymization

Data anonymization involves modifying data to prevent the identification of individuals, while still allowing for data analysis.

#### Removing Identifiers

Removing identifiers involves stripping out or obfuscating any data that can directly identify individuals.

**Steps to Remove Identifiers:**

1. **Identify PII**: Determine which data fields contain personally identifiable information (PII).
2. **Remove or Mask**: Remove or mask these fields to anonymize the data.

**Swift Code Example for Removing Identifiers:**

```swift
struct UserData {
    var name: String
    var email: String
    var age: Int
}

func anonymizeData(userData: [UserData]) -> [UserData] {
    return userData.map { user in
        UserData(name: "Anonymous", email: "hidden@example.com", age: user.age)
    }
}

let users = [UserData(name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com", age: 30)]
let anonymizedUsers = anonymizeData(userData: users)
print(anonymizedUsers)
```

#### Using Hashing

Hashing converts data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code. It's a one-way process, meaning you cannot reverse it to retrieve the original data.

**Steps to Use Hashing:**

1. **Choose a Hash Function**: Use a secure hash function like SHA-256.
2. **Hash Data**: Convert sensitive data to its hash representation.

**Swift Code Example for Hashing:**

```swift
import CryptoKit

func hashData(data: Data) -> String {
    let hash = SHA256.hash(data: data)
    return hash.compactMap { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
}

let sensitiveData = "Sensitive Information".data(using: .utf8)!
let hashedData = hashData(data: sensitiveData)
print("Hashed Data: \\(hashedData)")
```

**Key Considerations:**

- **Salted Hashes**: Use salts to enhance security, especially for passwords.
- **Irreversibility**: Ensure that the hash function used is irreversible.

### Secure Data Handling

Secure data handling involves practices that ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

#### Input Validation

Input validation ensures that the data received by the application is correct and safe to process.

**Steps for Input Validation:**

1. **Define Validation Rules**: Establish rules for what constitutes valid input.
2. **Validate Input**: Check input against these rules before processing.

**Swift Code Example for Input Validation:**

```swift
func isValidEmail(_ email: String) -> Bool {
    let emailRegEx = "[A-Z0-9a-z._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,64}"
    let emailPredicate = NSPredicate(format:"SELF MATCHES %@", emailRegEx)
    return emailPredicate.evaluate(with: email)
}

let email = "test@example.com"
print("Is valid email: \\(isValidEmail(email))")
```

#### Output Encoding

Output encoding transforms data into a safe format for rendering, preventing injection attacks.

**Steps for Output Encoding:**

1. **Identify Output Points**: Determine where data is output to users or systems.
2. **Encode Data**: Use appropriate encoding methods (e.g., HTML encoding) to prevent injection.

**Swift Code Example for Output Encoding:**

```swift
func htmlEncode(_ string: String) -> String {
    var encodedString = string
    encodedString = encodedString.replacingOccurrences(of: "&", with: "&amp;")
    encodedString = encodedString.replacingOccurrences(of: "<", with: "&lt;")
    encodedString = encodedString.replacingOccurrences(of: ">", with: "&gt;")
    encodedString = encodedString.replacingOccurrences(of: "\"", with: "&quot;")
    encodedString = encodedString.replacingOccurrences(of: "'", with: "&#39;")
    return encodedString
}

let userInput = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
let safeOutput = htmlEncode(userInput)
print("Encoded Output: \\(safeOutput)")
```

**Key Considerations:**

- **Contextual Encoding**: Use different encoding strategies based on the context (e.g., HTML, JavaScript).
- **Regular Updates**: Keep encoding libraries and methods updated to handle new threats.

### Visualizing Data Protection

To better understand the flow of data protection in a Swift application, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant Server

    User->>App: Enter sensitive data
    App->>App: Validate input
    alt Valid input
        App->>Server: Send encrypted data
        Server->>Server: Decrypt and process data
        Server->>App: Send encrypted response
    else Invalid input
        App->>User: Show validation error
    end
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the process of protecting sensitive data in a Swift application. The user inputs data, which the app validates. If valid, the app encrypts and sends the data to the server. The server decrypts, processes the data, and sends an encrypted response back to the app. If the input is invalid, the app returns an error message to the user.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the encryption key or hash function to see how it affects the output. Implement your own input validation rules and test them with different data sets. Remember, practice is key to mastering data protection in Swift!
