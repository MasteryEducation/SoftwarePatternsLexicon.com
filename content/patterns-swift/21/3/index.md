### Try It Yourself: Experiment with Swift Design Patterns

To solidify your understanding of Swift design patterns, try implementing a simple project using a combination of patterns. For example, create a basic iOS app that utilizes the Singleton, Observer, and Factory Method patterns. Experiment with modifying the patterns to suit your specific needs and observe how they interact within the application.

```swift
// Singleton Pattern Example
class DataManager {
    static let shared = DataManager()
    private init() {}
    
    func fetchData() {
        // Fetch data logic
    }
}

// Observer Pattern Example
protocol Observer {
    func update()
}

class ConcreteObserver: Observer {
    func update() {
        print("Observer notified")
    }
}

class Subject {
    private var observers = [Observer]()
    
    func attach(observer: Observer) {
        observers.append(observer)
    }
    
    func notify() {
        for observer in observers {
            observer.update()
        }
    }
}

// Factory Method Pattern Example
protocol Product {
    func use()
}

class ConcreteProductA: Product {
    func use() {
        print("Using Product A")
    }
}

class ConcreteProductB: Product {
    func use() {
        print("Using Product B")
    }
}

class Creator {
    func factoryMethod(type: String) -> Product {
        switch type {
        case "A":
            return ConcreteProductA()
        case "B":
            return ConcreteProductB()
        default:
            fatalError("Unknown product type")
        }
    }
}

// Usage
let product = Creator().factoryMethod(type: "A")
product.use()
```

### Visualizing Swift Design Patterns

Let's visualize how these patterns can be integrated into a simple iOS app architecture using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DataManager {
        +shared: DataManager
        -init()
        +fetchData()
    }
    
    class Observer {
        <<interface>>
        +update()
    }
    
    class ConcreteObserver {
        +update()
    }
    
    class Subject {
        -observers: Observer[]
        +attach(observer: Observer)
        +notify()
    }
    
    class Product {
        <<interface>>
        +use()
    }
    
    class ConcreteProductA {
        +use()
    }
    
    class ConcreteProductB {
        +use()
    }
    
    class Creator {
        +factoryMethod(type: String): Product
    }
    
    DataManager --|> Singleton
    ConcreteObserver --|> Observer
    Subject --> Observer
    ConcreteProductA --|> Product
    ConcreteProductB --|> Product
    Creator --> Product
```
