## 7.8 Hexagonal Architecture in Swift

Hexagonal Architecture, also known as the Ports and Adapters pattern, is a software design pattern that aims to isolate the core business logic from external factors like databases, user interfaces, or messaging systems. This architecture promotes a loosely coupled application, making it easier to maintain, test, and adapt to changes.

### Intent

The primary intent of Hexagonal Architecture is to create a system where the core business logic is isolated from external dependencies. This isolation ensures that the core logic remains unaffected by changes in technology or infrastructure, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.

### Implementing Hexagonal Architecture in Swift

Let's delve into how we can implement Hexagonal Architecture in Swift, covering the key components and their roles.

#### Domain Layer

The Domain Layer is the heart of Hexagonal Architecture. It contains the core business logic and rules that define the application's behavior. This layer should be independent of any external systems or frameworks, focusing solely on the business logic.

```swift
// Domain Model
struct User {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

// Domain Service
protocol UserService {
    func registerUser(name: String, email: String) -> User
}

class DefaultUserService: UserService {
    func registerUser(name: String, email: String) -> User {
        // Core business logic for user registration
        return User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `User` struct and `UserService` protocol represent the domain model and service, encapsulating the core business logic for user registration.

#### Ports and Adapters

Ports are interfaces that define how the core logic interacts with the outside world, while Adapters are implementations of these interfaces that connect the core logic to external systems.

```swift
// Port
protocol UserRepository {
    func save(user: User)
    func findUser(byEmail email: String) -> User?
}

// Adapter
class InMemoryUserRepository: UserRepository {
    private var users: [String: User] = [:]

    func save(user: User) {
        users[user.email] = user
    }

    func findUser(byEmail email: String) -> User? {
        return users[email]
    }
}
```

Here, `UserRepository` acts as a port, and `InMemoryUserRepository` is an adapter that implements this port, allowing the core logic to interact with an in-memory data store.

#### Inward Dependencies

One of the key principles of Hexagonal Architecture is that dependencies should point inward. This means that external layers depend on the inner domain, not vice versa. This ensures that the core business logic remains unaffected by changes in external systems.

```swift
class UserRegistration {
    private let userService: UserService
    private let userRepository: UserRepository

    init(userService: UserService, userRepository: UserRepository) {
        self.userService = userService
        self.userRepository = userRepository
    }

    func register(name: String, email: String) {
        let user = userService.registerUser(name: name, email: email)
        userRepository.save(user: user)
    }
}
```

In this example, `UserRegistration` depends on the `UserService` and `UserRepository` interfaces, ensuring that the core logic can be tested independently of the actual implementations.

#### Testing

Hexagonal Architecture makes it easier to test the core logic without external dependencies. By mocking the ports, we can test the core business logic in isolation.

```swift
// Mock Repository for Testing
class MockUserRepository: UserRepository {
    private var users: [String: User] = [:]

    func save(user: User) {
        users[user.email] = user
    }

    func findUser(byEmail email: String) -> User? {
        return users[email]
    }
}

// Unit Test
func testUserRegistration() {
    let userService = DefaultUserService()
    let userRepository = MockUserRepository()
    let registration = UserRegistration(userService: userService, userRepository: userRepository)

    registration.register(name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com")

    assert(userRepository.findUser(byEmail: "john.doe@example.com") != nil)
}
```

By using a `MockUserRepository`, we can test the `UserRegistration` logic without relying on a real data store.

### Use Cases and Examples

Hexagonal Architecture is particularly useful in scenarios where the application needs to be flexible and adaptable to changes. Let's explore some use cases and examples.

#### Test-Driven Development

Hexagonal Architecture simplifies testing of core logic by isolating it from external dependencies. This isolation allows developers to focus on writing tests for the business logic without worrying about the complexities of external systems.

#### Changing Technologies

With Hexagonal Architecture, you can swap out databases or UIs without affecting the core logic. For example, you can replace an in-memory data store with a SQL database by implementing a new adapter for the `UserRepository` port.

```swift
// SQL Adapter
class SQLUserRepository: UserRepository {
    func save(user: User) {
        // Save user to SQL database
    }

    func findUser(byEmail email: String) -> User? {
        // Find user in SQL database
        return nil
    }
}
```

By implementing `SQLUserRepository`, you can switch from an in-memory store to a SQL database without changing the core logic.

#### Plugin Systems

Hexagonal Architecture supports plugin systems by allowing new adapters to be added without modifying the core logic. This makes it easy to extend the application with new features or integrations.

### Visualizing Hexagonal Architecture in Swift

To better understand Hexagonal Architecture, let's visualize it using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Domain Layer] -->|Ports| B[Adapters];
    B -->|Inward Dependency| A;
    C[External Systems] --> B;
    B -->|Interaction| C;
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram illustrates the Hexagonal Architecture with the Domain Layer at the center, surrounded by Ports and Adapters. External systems interact with the Adapters, which in turn depend on the Domain Layer.

### Design Considerations

When implementing Hexagonal Architecture in Swift, consider the following:

- **Decoupling**: Ensure that the core logic is decoupled from external systems by using interfaces (ports).
- **Testing**: Focus on testing the core logic in isolation to ensure its correctness.
- **Flexibility**: Design the architecture to allow easy swapping of technologies by implementing new adapters.

### Swift Unique Features

Swift offers several features that complement Hexagonal Architecture, such as:

- **Protocols**: Use protocols to define ports, allowing for flexible and interchangeable implementations.
- **Structs and Enums**: Leverage value types to model domain entities, ensuring immutability and thread safety.
- **Extensions**: Use extensions to add functionality to domain models without modifying the original code.

### Differences and Similarities

Hexagonal Architecture is often compared to other architectural patterns like Clean Architecture and Onion Architecture. While they share similarities in isolating core logic, Hexagonal Architecture emphasizes the use of ports and adapters to achieve this isolation.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of Hexagonal Architecture in Swift, try modifying the code examples:

- Implement a new adapter for the `UserRepository` port using a different storage mechanism, such as a file-based store.
- Write unit tests for the `UserService` to ensure the correctness of the user registration logic.
- Experiment with adding new features to the core logic without affecting the existing adapters.
