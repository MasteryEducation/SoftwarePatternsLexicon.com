## 5.4 Decorator Design Pattern

The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In Swift, this pattern is particularly useful for adding responsibilities to objects at runtime, which is a common requirement in iOS and macOS app development. 

### Intent

The primary intent of the Decorator Design Pattern is to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. By using the Decorator pattern, you can create a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

### Key Participants

1. **Component**: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
2. **ConcreteComponent**: The class to which additional responsibilities can be added.
3. **Decorator**: Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to the Component's interface.
4. **ConcreteDecorator**: Adds responsibilities to the component.

### Diagram

Below is a class diagram illustrating the Decorator Design Pattern.

```mermaid

    class Component {
        +operation() String
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation() String
    }
    class Decorator {
        -component: Component
        +operation() String
    }
    class ConcreteDecorator {
        +operation() String
    }
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecorator
    Decorator o-- Component
```

### Implementing Decorator in Swift

To implement the Decorator pattern in Swift, we leverage protocols to define the component interface and create wrapper classes that conform to this interface. This approach ensures flexibility and adherence to Swift's protocol-oriented programming paradigm.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define the Component Protocol**

   The first step is to define a protocol that represents the component interface. This protocol will declare the methods that can be dynamically extended.

   ```swift
   protocol Coffee {
       func cost() -> Double
       func description() -> String
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Concrete Component**

   Next, create a concrete class that implements the component protocol. This class represents the object to which additional responsibilities can be added.

   ```swift
   class SimpleCoffee: Coffee {
       func cost() -> Double {
           return 5.0
       }

       func description() -> String {
           return "Simple Coffee"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement the Decorator Base Class**

   Create a base decorator class that also conforms to the component protocol. This class will hold a reference to a component object.

   ```swift
   class CoffeeDecorator: Coffee {
       private let decoratedCoffee: Coffee

       init(decoratedCoffee: Coffee) {
           self.decoratedCoffee = decoratedCoffee
       }

       func cost() -> Double {
           return decoratedCoffee.cost()
       }

       func description() -> String {
           return decoratedCoffee.description()
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Create Concrete Decorators**

   Finally, implement concrete decorators that extend the functionality of the component by overriding the methods of the decorator base class.

   ```swift
   class MilkDecorator: CoffeeDecorator {
       override func cost() -> Double {
           return super.cost() + 1.5
       }

       override func description() -> String {
           return super.description() + ", Milk"
       }
   }

   class SugarDecorator: CoffeeDecorator {
       override func cost() -> Double {
           return super.cost() + 0.5
       }

       override func description() -> String {
           return super.description() + ", Sugar"
       }
   }
   ```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Decorator pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to add responsibilities to objects without altering their structure. Here are some examples of how this pattern can be applied:

- **Extending Functionality**: In a text editor, decorators can be used to add functionalities such as spell checking, grammar checking, and formatting to a basic text component.
- **Adding Behaviors at Runtime**: In a graphics application, decorators can dynamically add features like borders, shadows, or color filters to graphical components.

#### Example: Coffee Shop

Let's consider a coffee shop scenario where we want to dynamically add ingredients to a coffee order.

```swift
let myCoffee: Coffee = SimpleCoffee()
print("Cost: \\(myCoffee.cost()), Description: \\(myCoffee.description())")

let milkCoffee: Coffee = MilkDecorator(decoratedCoffee: myCoffee)
print("Cost: \\(milkCoffee.cost()), Description: \\(milkCoffee.description())")

let milkSugarCoffee: Coffee = SugarDecorator(decoratedCoffee: milkCoffee)
print("Cost: \\(milkSugarCoffee.cost()), Description: \\(milkSugarCoffee.description())")
```

**Output:**

```
Cost: 5.0, Description: Simple Coffee
Cost: 6.5, Description: Simple Coffee, Milk
Cost: 7.0, Description: Simple Coffee, Milk, Sugar
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use the Decorator pattern when you need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently.
- **Avoid Overuse**: Overusing decorators can lead to a complex and difficult-to-understand codebase. It is crucial to balance the use of decorators with other design patterns.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance overhead introduced by multiple layers of decorators.

### Swift Unique Features

Swift's protocol-oriented programming offers a unique advantage when implementing the Decorator pattern. By using protocols, we can create flexible and reusable decorators that can be easily composed and extended.

#### Protocol Extensions

Swift allows us to use protocol extensions to provide default implementations for protocol methods. This feature can be leveraged to simplify the implementation of decorators.

```swift
extension Coffee {
    func description() -> String {
        return "Unknown Coffee"
    }
}
```

### Differences and Similarities

The Decorator pattern is often confused with the Adapter and Proxy patterns. Here's how they differ:

- **Decorator vs. Adapter**: The Adapter pattern changes the interface of an existing object, while the Decorator pattern enhances the behavior of an object without changing its interface.
- **Decorator vs. Proxy**: The Proxy pattern controls access to an object, whereas the Decorator pattern adds responsibilities to an object.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Decorator pattern, try modifying the code examples provided:

- Add a new decorator, such as `WhippedCreamDecorator`, and integrate it into the coffee shop example.
- Experiment with different combinations of decorators to see how they affect the cost and description of the coffee.

### Visualizing the Decorator Pattern

Here's a sequence diagram to visualize how the Decorator pattern works in the coffee shop example:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant SimpleCoffee
    participant MilkDecorator
    participant SugarDecorator

    Client->>SimpleCoffee: cost()
    SimpleCoffee-->>Client: 5.0
    Client->>MilkDecorator: cost()
    MilkDecorator->>SimpleCoffee: cost()
    SimpleCoffee-->>MilkDecorator: 5.0
    MilkDecorator-->>Client: 6.5
    Client->>SugarDecorator: cost()
    SugarDecorator->>MilkDecorator: cost()
    MilkDecorator->>SimpleCoffee: cost()
    SimpleCoffee-->>MilkDecorator: 5.0
    MilkDecorator-->>SugarDecorator: 6.5
    SugarDecorator-->>Client: 7.0
```
