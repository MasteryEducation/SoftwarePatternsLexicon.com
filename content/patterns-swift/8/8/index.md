## 8.8 Property Wrappers for Reusable Logic

### Intent

Property wrappers in Swift are a powerful feature designed to encapsulate common property logic, such as validation, synchronization, or transformation, thereby reducing boilerplate and improving code reuse. By using property wrappers, developers can abstract repetitive logic into reusable components, making code cleaner and more maintainable.

### Implementing Property Wrappers in Swift

Property wrappers in Swift allow you to define a custom behavior for a property. They are defined using the `@propertyWrapper` attribute and can be applied to any property in your code.

#### Creating a Wrapper

To create a property wrapper, you start by defining a struct, class, or enum with the `@propertyWrapper` attribute. The core requirement is to implement a `wrappedValue` property, which represents the actual value being wrapped.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Capitalized {
    private var value: String = ""
    
    var wrappedValue: String {
        get { value }
        set { value = newValue.capitalized }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Capitalized` property wrapper ensures that any string assigned to it is automatically capitalized.

#### Wrapped Value

The `wrappedValue` property is the centerpiece of a property wrapper. It defines how the value is stored and accessed. You can implement custom logic in the getter and setter to modify the behavior of the property.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Clamped {
    private var value: Int
    private let range: ClosedRange<Int>
    
    var wrappedValue: Int {
        get { value }
        set { value = min(max(newValue, range.lowerBound), range.upperBound) }
    }
    
    init(wrappedValue: Int, range: ClosedRange<Int>) {
        self.range = range
        self.value = min(max(wrappedValue, range.lowerBound), range.upperBound)
    }
}
```

The `Clamped` property wrapper restricts an integer value to a specified range, ensuring it never exceeds the bounds.

#### Projecting Values

Sometimes, you might want to expose additional functionality or state beyond the `wrappedValue`. This is where `projectedValue` comes into play. By defining a `projectedValue`, you can provide extra capabilities to the users of your property wrapper.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Logged<T> {
    private var value: T
    private(set) var projectedValue: [T] = []
    
    var wrappedValue: T {
        get { value }
        set {
            projectedValue.append(newValue)
            value = newValue
        }
    }
    
    init(wrappedValue: T) {
        self.value = wrappedValue
    }
}
```

In this `Logged` wrapper, every time the value changes, the change is logged in the `projectedValue` array.

#### Using Wrappers

To use a property wrapper, simply apply it to a property with the `@` syntax. Here's how you might use the `Capitalized` and `Clamped` wrappers:

```swift
struct User {
    @Capitalized var name: String
    @Clamped(range: 0...100) var age: Int
}

var user = User(name: "john doe", age: 105)
print(user.name) // Outputs: "John Doe"
print(user.age)  // Outputs: 100
```

### Use Cases and Examples

Property wrappers can be applied in a variety of scenarios to simplify and enhance your codebase.

#### Data Validation

One common use case for property wrappers is data validation. You can ensure that values meet certain criteria before they are accepted.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct ValidatedEmail {
    private var email: String = ""
    
    var wrappedValue: String {
        get { email }
        set {
            if isValidEmail(newValue) {
                email = newValue
            } else {
                print("Invalid email address")
            }
        }
    }
    
    private func isValidEmail(_ email: String) -> Bool {
        // Simple regex for demonstration purposes
        let regex = "[A-Z0-9a-z._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}"
        return NSPredicate(format: "SELF MATCHES %@", regex).evaluate(with: email)
    }
}
```

This `ValidatedEmail` wrapper ensures that only valid email addresses are stored.

#### Lazy Initialization

Property wrappers can also be used to implement lazy initialization, delaying the creation of expensive resources until they are actually needed.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Lazy<Value> {
    private var storage: (() -> Value)?
    private var value: Value?
    
    var wrappedValue: Value {
        mutating get {
            if let value = value {
                return value
            } else if let storage = storage {
                let value = storage()
                self.value = value
                self.storage = nil
                return value
            }
            fatalError("Lazy value not initialized")
        }
    }
    
    init(initializer: @escaping () -> Value) {
        self.storage = initializer
    }
}
```

With the `Lazy` wrapper, you can defer the initialization of a property until it is first accessed.

#### Thread Safety

For properties that require synchronized access in a multithreaded environment, property wrappers can provide a neat solution.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
class Synchronized<Value> {
    private var value: Value
    private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "synchronized.queue")
    
    var wrappedValue: Value {
        get {
            return queue.sync { value }
        }
        set {
            queue.sync { value = newValue }
        }
    }
    
    init(wrappedValue: Value) {
        self.value = wrappedValue
    }
}
```

The `Synchronized` wrapper ensures that access to the property is thread-safe.

### Visualizing Property Wrappers

To better understand how property wrappers work, let's visualize the flow of data using a simple diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Property Declaration] --> B[Property Wrapper]
    B --> C[Wrapped Value Access]
    B --> D[Projected Value Access]
    C --> E[Getter/Setter Logic]
    D --> F[Additional Functionality]
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of using a property wrapper. The property declaration is linked to the property wrapper, which manages both the wrapped value and any projected values. The wrapped value is accessed through getter/setter logic, while the projected value provides additional functionality.
