## 11.8 Error Handling in Reactive Streams

In the world of reactive programming, handling errors effectively is crucial for building robust and resilient applications. Swift's Combine framework provides powerful tools to manage errors in reactive streams, ensuring that your applications can gracefully handle unexpected situations. In this section, we will explore error propagation, recovery strategies, and techniques for designing resilient streams in Swift.

### Error Propagation

Reactive streams in Combine are designed to propagate errors through the stream's lifecycle. Understanding how errors are propagated and how they can terminate streams is essential for effective error handling.

#### Failure Completion

In Combine, a stream can complete in two ways: successfully or with a failure. When an error occurs, the stream terminates with a failure completion. This means that no further values will be emitted, and any downstream subscribers will receive the error.

```swift
import Combine

enum NetworkError: Error {
    case invalidResponse
    case serverError
}

let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String, NetworkError>()

let subscription = publisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .finished:
            print("Stream completed successfully.")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Stream failed with error: \\(error)")
        }
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Received value: \\(value)")
    })

publisher.send("Hello, World!")
publisher.send(completion: .failure(.serverError))
```

In this example, the stream emits a value and then terminates with a `serverError`. The `sink` subscriber handles the error in the `receiveCompletion` closure, allowing us to respond to the failure appropriately.

### Recovering from Errors

While error propagation is a natural part of reactive streams, Combine provides operators to recover from errors and continue processing values.

#### Using `catch` Operator

The `catch` operator allows you to handle errors and provide an alternative publisher to continue the stream. This operator is useful for providing fallback values or retrying failed operations.

```swift
let fallbackPublisher = Just("Fallback value")
    .setFailureType(to: NetworkError.self)

let recoverySubscription = publisher
    .catch { error -> Just<String> in
        print("Handling error: \\(error)")
        return fallbackPublisher
    }
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        print("Recovery stream completed: \\(completion)")
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Recovery received value: \\(value)")
    })

publisher.send("Hello, World!")
publisher.send(completion: .failure(.invalidResponse))
```

In this example, when the original stream fails with an `invalidResponse` error, the `catch` operator provides a fallback publisher that emits a default value, allowing the stream to continue.

#### Using `retry` Operator

The `retry` operator attempts to resubscribe to the original publisher a specified number of times when an error occurs. This operator is useful for transient errors that may succeed on subsequent attempts.

```swift
let retrySubscription = publisher
    .retry(3)
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        print("Retry stream completed: \\(completion)")
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Retry received value: \\(value)")
    })

publisher.send("Hello, World!")
publisher.send(completion: .failure(.serverError))
```

Here, the `retry` operator attempts to resubscribe to the publisher up to three times if a `serverError` occurs, providing multiple chances for the operation to succeed.

### Designing Resilient Streams

To build resilient applications, it's important to design streams that can gracefully handle errors and continue processing when possible. Let's explore some strategies for achieving this.

#### Fallback Values

Providing fallback values is a common strategy for handling errors in reactive streams. By supplying default values, you can ensure that your application continues to function even when errors occur.

```swift
let defaultPublisher = Just("Default value")
    .setFailureType(to: NetworkError.self)

let fallbackSubscription = publisher
    .replaceError(with: "Default value")
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        print("Fallback stream completed: \\(completion)")
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Fallback received value: \\(value)")
    })

publisher.send(completion: .failure(.invalidResponse))
```

In this example, the `replaceError` operator provides a default value when an error occurs, allowing the stream to complete successfully.

#### Selective Error Handling

In some cases, you may want to handle specific errors while allowing others to propagate. The `catch` operator can be used to selectively handle errors based on their type or context.

```swift
let selectiveSubscription = publisher
    .catch { error -> AnyPublisher<String, NetworkError> in
        switch error {
        case .invalidResponse:
            return Just("Handled invalid response error")
                .setFailureType(to: NetworkError.self)
                .eraseToAnyPublisher()
        default:
            return Fail(error: error).eraseToAnyPublisher()
        }
    }
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        print("Selective stream completed: \\(completion)")
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Selective received value: \\(value)")
    })

publisher.send(completion: .failure(.invalidResponse))
```

Here, the `catch` operator handles the `invalidResponse` error by providing an alternative publisher, while allowing other errors to propagate.

#### Custom Error Types

Defining meaningful custom error types can improve the clarity and debuggability of your reactive streams. By creating specific error types, you can provide more context and detail about the errors that occur.

```swift
enum DataError: Error {
    case notFound
    case corruptedData(reason: String)
}

let dataPublisher = PassthroughSubject<Data, DataError>()

let customErrorSubscription = dataPublisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .finished:
            print("Data stream completed successfully.")
        case .failure(let error):
            switch error {
            case .notFound:
                print("Data not found.")
            case .corruptedData(let reason):
                print("Data corrupted: \\(reason)")
            }
        }
    }, receiveValue: { data in
        print("Received data: \\(data)")
    })

dataPublisher.send(completion: .failure(.corruptedData(reason: "Checksum mismatch")))
```

In this example, the `DataError` enum provides specific error cases, allowing the subscriber to handle each error with appropriate logic.

### Visualizing Error Handling in Reactive Streams

To better understand the flow of error handling in reactive streams, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Publisher
    participant Subscriber
    participant FallbackPublisher

    Publisher->>Subscriber: send("Hello, World!")
    Publisher->>Subscriber: send(completion: .failure(.invalidResponse))
    Subscriber->>FallbackPublisher: catch error
    FallbackPublisher->>Subscriber: send("Fallback value")
    FallbackPublisher->>Subscriber: send(completion: .finished)
```

This diagram illustrates how a publisher sends values and an error, triggering the `catch` operator to provide a fallback value and complete the stream.
