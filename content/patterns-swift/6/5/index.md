## 6.5 Mediator Design Pattern

In the world of software development, managing complex interactions between objects can often lead to tightly coupled systems, making maintenance and scalability difficult. The **Mediator Design Pattern** offers a solution by encapsulating the interactions within a single mediator object, thereby promoting loose coupling and simplifying communication.

### Intent

The intent of the Mediator Design Pattern is to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by ensuring that objects do not refer to each other explicitly, but instead communicate through a mediator.

### Implementing Mediator in Swift

Let's delve into how we can implement the Mediator Design Pattern in Swift, breaking it down into several key components:

#### Mediator Protocol

Start by defining a protocol that declares methods for communication between the mediator and its colleagues.

```swift
protocol Mediator {
    func notify(sender: Colleague, event: String)
}
```

#### Concrete Mediator

Implement a concrete mediator class that coordinates communication between colleagues. This class will manage the interactions and ensure that each component communicates through the mediator.

```swift
class ConcreteMediator: Mediator {
    private var colleagues: [Colleague] = []
    
    func addColleague(colleague: Colleague) {
        colleagues.append(colleague)
    }
    
    func notify(sender: Colleague, event: String) {
        for colleague in colleagues {
            if colleague !== sender {
                colleague.receive(event: event)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Colleague Protocol

Define a protocol for components (colleagues) that interact through the mediator. Each colleague will have a reference to the mediator and will communicate through it.

```swift
protocol Colleague: AnyObject {
    var mediator: Mediator? { get set }
    func receive(event: String)
}
```

#### Concrete Colleagues

Create concrete classes for colleagues that implement the `Colleague` protocol. These classes will use the mediator to communicate with each other.

```swift
class ConcreteColleagueA: Colleague {
    weak var mediator: Mediator?
    
    func send(event: String) {
        print("Colleague A sends event: \\(event)")
        mediator?.notify(sender: self, event: event)
    }
    
    func receive(event: String) {
        print("Colleague A receives event: \\(event)")
    }
}

class ConcreteColleagueB: Colleague {
    weak var mediator: Mediator?
    
    func send(event: String) {
        print("Colleague B sends event: \\(event)")
        mediator?.notify(sender: self, event: event)
    }
    
    func receive(event: String) {
        print("Colleague B receives event: \\(event)")
    }
}
```

#### Decoupling Components

By using a mediator, components only know about the mediator, not about each other. This decoupling allows for more flexible and maintainable code.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Mediator Design Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to communicate in a complex system. Here are some common use cases:

#### UI Components

In a dialog box, various controls (buttons, text fields, etc.) interact with each other. Instead of each control having direct references to others, they can communicate through a mediator.

```swift
// Example of a UI Mediator
class DialogMediator: Mediator {
    private var button: Button?
    private var textField: TextField?
    
    func setButton(button: Button) {
        self.button = button
    }
    
    func setTextField(textField: TextField) {
        self.textField = textField
    }
    
    func notify(sender: Colleague, event: String) {
        if sender === button && event == "click" {
            textField?.receive(event: "Button clicked")
        }
    }
}

class Button: Colleague {
    weak var mediator: Mediator?
    
    func click() {
        print("Button clicked")
        mediator?.notify(sender: self, event: "click")
    }
    
    func receive(event: String) {
        // Handle event
    }
}

class TextField: Colleague {
    weak var mediator: Mediator?
    
    func receive(event: String) {
        print("TextField received event: \\(event)")
    }
}

// Usage
let dialogMediator = DialogMediator()
let button = Button()
let textField = TextField()

button.mediator = dialogMediator
textField.mediator = dialogMediator

dialogMediator.setButton(button: button)
dialogMediator.setTextField(textField: textField)

button.click()
```

#### Messaging Systems

In messaging systems, a central hub can manage message exchanges between clients, ensuring that messages are routed correctly without clients needing to know about each other.

#### Air Traffic Control

In an air traffic control system, planes (colleagues) communicate through a control tower (mediator), which coordinates their actions to ensure safety and efficiency.

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

To better understand the Mediator Design Pattern, let's visualize the relationships between the mediator and its colleagues.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Mediator {
        +notify(sender: Colleague, event: String)
    }
    class ConcreteMediator {
        +addColleague(colleague: Colleague)
        +notify(sender: Colleague, event: String)
    }
    class Colleague {
        +mediator: Mediator
        +receive(event: String)
    }
    class ConcreteColleagueA {
        +send(event: String)
        +receive(event: String)
    }
    class ConcreteColleagueB {
        +send(event: String)
        +receive(event: String)
    }
    
    Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
    Colleague <|-- ConcreteColleagueA
    Colleague <|-- ConcreteColleagueB
    ConcreteMediator --> Colleague
    ConcreteColleagueA --> Mediator
    ConcreteColleagueB --> Mediator
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Mediator Design Pattern, consider the following:

- **Complexity**: While the mediator simplifies communication, it can become a complex component if it handles too many interactions.
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the mediator can handle an increasing number of colleagues without becoming a bottleneck.
- **Flexibility**: The mediator should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the system without requiring significant modifications.

### Swift Unique Features

Swift's strong type system and protocol-oriented programming paradigm make it an excellent choice for implementing the Mediator Design Pattern. Use protocols to define the mediator and colleague interfaces, and leverage Swift's weak references to avoid retain cycles.

### Differences and Similarities

The Mediator Design Pattern is often confused with the Observer Pattern. Both patterns facilitate communication between objects, but the mediator centralizes control, while the observer pattern distributes it.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the mediator pattern by modifying the code examples. Try adding new colleagues or events, and observe how the mediator manages these interactions. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of the pattern.
