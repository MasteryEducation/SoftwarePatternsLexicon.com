## 14.5 Parsing JSON and Codable Protocols

In the realm of modern app development, efficiently handling data is crucial, especially when dealing with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a widely-used data format. Swift's `Codable` protocol simplifies the process of encoding and decoding data, making it easier to work with JSON. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of JSON parsing using `Codable` protocols, exploring automatic synthesis, custom coding keys, decoding strategies, and error handling.

### Introduction to Codable Protocols

Swift's `Codable` protocol is a type alias for the `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols, allowing types to be encoded to and decoded from external representations such as JSON. By conforming to `Codable`, Swift types can automatically gain the ability to serialize and deserialize themselves with minimal boilerplate code.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String
    var email: String
}
```

In this example, the `User` struct automatically conforms to `Codable`, enabling JSON encoding and decoding without additional code.

### Automatic Synthesis of Codable

Swift provides automatic synthesis of the `Codable` protocol for types that have properties conforming to `Codable`. This feature significantly reduces the amount of code developers need to write and maintain.

#### How Automatic Synthesis Works

When a struct or class conforms to `Codable`, Swift synthesizes the necessary methods to encode and decode instances of that type, provided all its properties are also `Codable`. This synthesis covers both `Encodable` and `Decodable` functionalities.

```swift
let jsonData = """
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
""".data(using: .utf8)!

do {
    let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
    print("User: \\(user.name), Email: \\(user.email)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to decode JSON: \\(error)")
}
```

### Custom Coding Keys

Sometimes, the keys in JSON data do not match the property names in your Swift types. In such cases, you can use custom coding keys to map JSON keys to your properties.

#### Implementing Custom Coding Keys

To handle mismatched keys, define a nested `CodingKeys` enum within your type that conforms to `CodingKey`. This enum specifies the mapping between JSON keys and property names.

```swift
struct Product: Codable {
    var id: Int
    var productName: String
    var price: Double

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case productName = "product_name"
        case price
    }
}
```

In this example, the `productName` property maps to the `product_name` key in the JSON data.

### Decoding Strategies

Swift's `JSONDecoder` provides several strategies to handle common decoding scenarios, such as date parsing and key naming conventions.

#### DateDecodingStrategy

Dates in JSON can be represented in various formats. Swift's `JSONDecoder` offers several `DateDecodingStrategy` options to parse dates.

```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .iso8601

struct Event: Codable {
    var name: String
    var date: Date
}

let jsonData = """
{
    "name": "Conference",
    "date": "2023-11-23T10:00:00Z"
}
""".data(using: .utf8)!

do {
    let event = try decoder.decode(Event.self, from: jsonData)
    print("Event: \\(event.name), Date: \\(event.date)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to decode JSON: \\(error)")
}
```

#### KeyDecodingStrategy

The `KeyDecodingStrategy` allows you to convert between different key naming conventions, such as converting snake_case keys to camelCase properties.

```swift
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase

struct Article: Codable {
    var title: String
    var authorName: String
}

let jsonData = """
{
    "title": "Swift Codable",
    "author_name": "Jane Doe"
}
""".data(using: .utf8)!

do {
    let article = try decoder.decode(Article.self, from: jsonData)
    print("Article: \\(article.title), Author: \\(article.authorName)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to decode JSON: \\(error)")
}
```

### Error Handling in JSON Decoding

When working with JSON, errors are inevitable. Swift provides robust mechanisms to handle decoding errors gracefully.

#### Using Do-Catch Blocks

Swift's `do-catch` blocks allow you to manage errors during the decoding process. You can catch specific errors or handle them generically.

```swift
do {
    let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
    print("User: \\(user.name), Email: \\(user.email)")
} catch DecodingError.dataCorrupted(let context) {
    print("Data corrupted: \\(context.debugDescription)")
} catch DecodingError.keyNotFound(let key, let context) {
    print("Key '\\(key)' not found: \\(context.debugDescription)")
} catch {
    print("Decoding error: \\(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

#### Partial Decoding

In scenarios where JSON data might have missing or extra fields, Swift allows partial decoding. This approach enables you to decode only the fields you need, ignoring others.

```swift
struct PartialUser: Codable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String
}

let jsonData = """
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
""".data(using: .utf8)!

do {
    let partialUser = try JSONDecoder().decode(PartialUser.self, from: jsonData)
    print("Partial User: \\(partialUser.name)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to decode JSON: \\(error)")
}
```

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples. For instance, experiment with different `DateDecodingStrategy` options, or create a new struct with custom coding keys and test it with JSON data that has mismatched keys.

### Visualizing JSON Parsing with Codable

Let's visualize the process of JSON parsing using Codable protocols in Swift. This diagram illustrates the flow from JSON data to Swift objects using automatic synthesis and custom coding keys.
