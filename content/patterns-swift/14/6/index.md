## 14.6 Handling Network Errors and Retries

In today's connected world, robust network error handling and retry strategies are essential for building resilient applications. Whether you're developing for iOS, macOS, or server-side Swift, understanding how to effectively manage network errors and implement retry mechanisms can significantly enhance the user experience and reliability of your applications. In this section, we will explore common network errors, strategies for implementing retries, and how to maintain a seamless user experience even in the face of network challenges.

### Understanding Common Network Errors

Network errors are inevitable in any application that relies on internet connectivity. These errors can arise from various sources, including server-side issues, client-side connectivity problems, or even transient network conditions. Let's delve into some of the most common types of network errors you might encounter:

#### HTTP Errors

HTTP errors are typically indicated by status codes returned from the server. These are categorized into different ranges:

- **4xx Client Errors**: These errors indicate issues on the client's side, such as a malformed request or unauthorized access. Common examples include:
  - **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication.
  - **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
  - **403 Forbidden**: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

- **5xx Server Errors**: These errors indicate issues on the server's side, suggesting that the server failed to fulfill a valid request. Examples include:
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.
  - **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.

#### Connection Issues

Connection issues can prevent your application from communicating with the server. These can be caused by:

- **Timeouts**: When a request takes too long to complete, it may time out, leading to an error.
- **No Internet Connection**: The device is not connected to the internet, preventing any network requests from succeeding.

### Implementing Retries

Implementing a retry mechanism is crucial for recovering from transient network errors. A well-designed retry strategy can improve the resilience of your application by automatically attempting to recover from errors without user intervention.

#### Retry Policies

When implementing retries, it's important to define a clear policy. Here are some common strategies:

- **Immediate Retries**: Attempt to retry the request immediately after a failure. This is suitable for transient errors that are likely to resolve quickly.
- **Delayed Retries**: Introduce a delay between retries to give the system time to recover. This can be implemented using exponential backoff, where the delay increases with each subsequent retry.

```swift
import Foundation

func performRequestWithRetry(url: URL, maxAttempts: Int, delay: TimeInterval, completion: @escaping (Data?, URLResponse?, Error?) -> Void) {
    var attempts = 0
    
    func attemptRequest() {
        attempts += 1
        let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
            if let error = error, attempts < maxAttempts {
                print("Request failed with error: \\(error). Retrying in \\(delay) seconds...")
                DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + delay) {
                    attemptRequest()
                }
            } else {
                completion(data, response, error)
            }
        }
        task.resume()
    }
    
    attemptRequest()
}
```

In the code above, we define a function `performRequestWithRetry` that attempts to perform a network request up to a specified number of times (`maxAttempts`). If an error occurs, it waits for a specified delay before retrying.

#### Maximum Attempts

To prevent infinite retry loops, it's essential to set a maximum number of retry attempts. This ensures that your application doesn't exhaust resources or create a poor user experience by continuously retrying a failing request.

### Enhancing User Experience

Handling network errors gracefully is not just about retrying requests; it's also about maintaining a positive user experience. Here are some strategies to consider:

#### Providing Helpful Error Messages

When network errors occur, it's important to inform users of the issue in a clear and helpful manner. Avoid technical jargon and provide actionable suggestions when possible.

```swift
func handleNetworkError(_ error: Error) {
    // Provide a user-friendly error message
    let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Network Error", message: "Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection and try again.", preferredStyle: .alert)
    alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Retry", style: .default, handler: { _ in
        // Retry the operation
    }))
    alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil))
    // Present the alert to the user
    // Assuming this is called within a UIViewController
    self.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

#### Offline Mode

Consider implementing an offline mode that allows your app to function without an active network connection. This can involve caching data locally and syncing changes once connectivity is restored.

```swift
import CoreData

func fetchCachedData() -> [CachedItem] {
    // Fetch data from local cache
    let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<CachedItem> = CachedItem.fetchRequest()
    do {
        let cachedItems = try persistentContainer.viewContext.fetch(fetchRequest)
        return cachedItems
    } catch {
        print("Failed to fetch cached data: \\(error)")
        return []
    }
}

func syncDataWithServer() {
    // Sync local changes with the server once the connection is restored
    // This function should be called when the network becomes available
}
```

### Visualizing Network Error Handling and Retry Logic

To better understand how network error handling and retry logic work together, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant Network

    User->>App: Initiate Request
    App->>Network: Send Request
    Network-->>App: Error Response
    App->>App: Check Retry Policy
    alt Retry Allowed
        App->>Network: Retry Request
        Network-->>App: Success Response
        App-->>User: Display Success
    else Retry Limit Reached
        App-->>User: Display Error Message
    end
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of a network request, handling errors, and retrying based on a defined policy. The app attempts to retry the request if allowed by the retry policy, otherwise, it displays an error message to the user.
