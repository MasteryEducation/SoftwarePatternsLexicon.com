## Introduction

In machine learning applications, securing sensitive data is paramount. This is especially true during the inference phase when the model makes predictions based on potentially sensitive inputs. **Data Masking on Inference** is a design pattern that focuses on techniques to obfuscate or anonymize sensitive data during the inference process to protect user privacy and comply with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.

## Objectives

- Protect sensitive data during the inference phase.
- Ensure regulatory compliance and user privacy.
- Mitigate risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Techniques and Strategies

### Rule-Based Masking

Applying predefined rules to redact or transform sensitive information. For example, masking all digits of a social security number except for the last four.

```python
def mask_ssn(ssn):
    return "***-**-" + ssn[-4:]

ssn = "123-45-6789"
masked_ssn = mask_ssn(ssn)
print(masked_ssn)  # Output: ***-**-6789
```

### Tokenization

Replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholders (tokens) that can be mapped back to the original data using a secure reference table.

```python
import uuid

def tokenize(data):
    token_table = {}
    token = str(uuid.uuid4())
    token_table[token] = data
    return token, token_table

data = "john.doe@example.com"
token, table = tokenize(data)
print(token)  # Output: token such as "73cf5761-8265-4eda-bc54-3a796df902d3"
print(table)  # Output: {'73cf5761-8265-4eda-bc54-3a796df902d3': 'john.doe@example.com'}
```

### Anonymization

Removing or distorting identifiers to prevent the association between the data and individuals.

```python
from faker import Faker

def anonymize_data():
    fake = Faker()
    return fake.email(), fake.ssn()

email, ssn = anonymize_data()
print(email, ssn)  # Outputs anonymized email and SSN
```

## Implementation Examples

### Using TensorFlow Privacy

TensorFlow provides tools to add data masking and anonymization mechanics for secure models during inference.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_privacy.privacy.optimizers.dp_optimizer import DPGradientDescentGaussianOptimizer

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

optimizer = DPGradientDescentGaussianOptimizer(
    l2_norm_clip=1.0,
    noise_multiplier=0.1,
    num_microbatches=1,
    learning_rate=0.15
)

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer,
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0

fake = Faker()
x_train_anonymized = [fake.ssn() for _ in x_train]

model.fit(x_train_anonymized, y_train, epochs=1, batch_size=32)
```

### Application in Secure APIs

Consider a RESTful API that serves a machine learning model. Before logging or returning any data, sensitive information is masked.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

def mock_inference(data):
    return {"prediction": "Positive", "confidence": 0.95}

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    masked_data = mask_ssn(data["ssn"])
    result = mock_inference(data)
    return jsonify(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

# POST /predict with JSON {"ssn": "123-45-6789"}
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Differential Privacy

Differential Privacy involves adding noise to the data to prevent the leakage of sensitive information and ensure privacy during the inference process.

```python
import numpy as np

def add_noise(data, epsilon=0.1):
    sigma = np.sqrt(2 * np.log(1.25 / 0.05)) / epsilon
    noisy_data = data + np.random.normal(0, sigma, data.shape)
    return noisy_data

data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
noisy_data = add_noise(data)
print(noisy_data)  # Output: array with added noise
```

### Homomorphic Encryption

Encrypt data in a way that allows operations to be performed on the encrypted data, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the original data.

## Summary

**Data Masking on Inference** is a critical design pattern for ensuring user privacy and data security in machine learning applications. By implementing techniques like rule-based masking, tokenization, and anonymization, developers can greatly reduce the risk of sensitive data exposure. This pattern, combined with related strategies such as Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption, provides a robust framework for secure machine learning deployments.

Implementing these practices not only safeguards data but also helps to comply with stringent regulatory requirements, thereby fostering user trust and enhancing the overall adoption of ML solutions.
