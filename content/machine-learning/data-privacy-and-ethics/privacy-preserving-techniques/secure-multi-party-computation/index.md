Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) is an advanced cryptographic technique allowing multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs completely private. SMPC ensures that no information about the individual inputs is ever disclosed to the other parties, apart from what can be inferred from the output of the computation.

## Concepts and Components

### Background and Importance

In many real-world scenarios, different entities may want to collaborate on running computations over their combined data, but privacy concerns prevent them from sharing their datasets. SMPC bridges this gap by allowing collaboration without compromising data privacy.

### Core Principles

- **Input Privacy:** Each party's input remains confidential.
- **Correctness:** The computation is performed correctly according to the specified function.
- **Output Privacy:** Only the intended output is revealed to the parties.

### Subcategories and Techniques

Several techniques underpin SMPC:
- **Garbled Circuits:** Employed in secure function evaluation.
- **Homomorphic Encryption:** Allows certain types of computations to be performed on encrypted data.
- **Secret Sharing:** Splits data into "shares" distributed among parties.

## Practical Example

Consider a scenario where multiple hospitals want to collaborate on a study to identify disease patterns without sharing individual patient data.

Using Python, we may employ the library `pysyft`, which facilitates privacy-preserving machine learning. Here's a simplified example:

```python
import syft as sy
from syft.core.node.private_tensor import VirtualMachinePrivateTensor

virtual_machine = sy.VirtualMachine(name="secure_hospital_network")

hospital_a_data = virtual_machine.tensor([1, 0, 0, 1])
hospital_b_data = virtual_machine.tensor([0, 1, 1, 0])

secure_sum = hospital_a_data.private() + hospital_b_data.private()

print("Total Sum: ", secure_sum.get())

```

Here, `pysyft` allows us to perform a secure sum operation where both hospital datasets remain private.

## Related Design Patterns

### 1. **Federated Learning**
**Description:** A technique that enables model training across decentralized data sources without centralizing data.
**Related:** Both Federated Learning and SMPC focus on data privacy, but SMPC extends to secure computation beyond model training.

### 2. **Differential Privacy**
**Description:** Adds noise to data or computations to protect individual data points from being identified.
**Related:** Differential Privacy ensures privacy by introducing uncertainty, while SMPC ensures data privacy through collaboration without sharing raw data.

## Summary

Secure Multi-Party Computation is pivotal for enabling secure and private collaborative computations. By implementing techniques like garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption, and secret sharing, SMPC ensures privacy while preserving the integrity of the output. Practically leveraging libraries like `pysyft` in Python can aid in deploying SMPC-based solutions, providing a robust framework for privacy in collaborative settings. Combining SMPC with related design patterns such as Federated Learning and Differential Privacy can offer even greater privacy-preserving capabilities.
