## Overview

Business Intelligence (BI) tools are essential for decision-making by providing insights from data. The BI Tools Integration design pattern involves embedding machine learning models and advanced analytics within these tools. This pattern empowers users to directly leverage predictions and analytics without needing to leave their familiar BI environment.

## Subcategory: Integration with Enterprise Systems

- **Primary Focus**: Making machine learning predictions and analytics easily accessible within enterprise BI tools.
  
## Detailed Description

Integrating machine learning and BI tools enables organizations to enhance their data-driven decision-making capabilities. The traditional challenges include moving data between disparate systems and requiring data scientists to manually interpret ML models. This pattern tackles these challenges by embedding ML models directly into BI platforms.

### Key Concepts

- **Embedding Predictions**: Machine learning models provide predictions that are directly incorporated into the BI dashboards.
- **Interactivity**: Users can interact with the model output, refining the inputs to explore different scenarios.
- **Automation**: Automated data refreshes ensure that the predictions remain up-to-date.
- **Visualization**: Enhanced visualizations aid in interpreting complex machine learning predictions.

## Example Implementations

### Python and Tableau Integration

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import tableauserverclient as TSC

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': np.random.rand(100),
    'feature2': np.random.rand(100),
    'target': np.random.rand(100)
})

X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = data['target']
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

def make_predictions(df):
    predictions = model.predict(df[['feature1', 'feature2']])
    df['predictions'] = predictions
    return df

def load_to_tableau(df, project_id, datasource_name):
    tableau_auth = TSC.TableauAuth('your_username', 'your_password', site_id='your_site')
    server = TSC.Server('http://your_server', use_server_version=True)
    with server.auth.sign_in(tableau_auth):
        datasource = TSC.DatasourceItem(project_id, name=datasource_name)
        server.datasources.publish(datasource, filepath, TSC.Server.PublishMode.Append)

predicted_data = make_predictions(data)
load_to_tableau(predicted_data, 'project_id', 'datasource_name')
```

### Integration Using Power BI and Azure ML

1. **Model Deployment in Azure ML**: 
    - Train and deploy a machine learning model in Azure Machine Learning.
    - Generate a REST API endpoint for scoring.

2. **Power BI Dataflows**:
    - Use Power Query in Power BI to call the Azure ML endpoint.
    - Bring model predictions as part of the data pipeline.

```m
let
    url = "https://<your-azureml-endpoint>",
    apikey = "<your-api-key>",
    payload = Text.FromBinary(Json.FromValue(YOUR_INPUT_DATA)),

    Source = Json.Document(Web.Contents(url, [
        Headers = [#"Content-Type"="application/json", #"Authorization"="Bearer " & apikey],
        Content = Text.ToBinary(payload)
    ]))
in
    Source
```

## Related Design Patterns

### 1. **Model Serving**
   - **Description**: Operationalizing the machine learning models by exposing them through web services.
   - **Relation**: Model Serving provides the APIs needed to embed predictions into BI tools.

### 2. **Data Pipeline Automation**
   - **Description**: Automation of the entire data pipeline from data ingestion to model prediction.
   - **Relation**: Ensures smooth and timely data flow for the BI tool integrations to work effectively.

### 3. **Interactive Analytics**
   - **Description**: Enables users to interact with data and experiment with hypotheses in real-time.
   - **Relation**: Enhances the user experience within BI tools by allowing for interactive model exploration.

## Summary

The BI Tools Integration design pattern bridges the gap between machine learning models and business intelligence tools. By embedding predictions and analytics within BI platforms, businesses can enhance their decision-making processes without disrupting their workflow. This seamless integration makes advanced analytics accessible to non-technical users, thereby democratizing insights across the organization.
