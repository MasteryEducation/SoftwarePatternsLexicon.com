## Introduction

Canary Deployment is a design pattern used in machine learning systems to introduce new model versions gradually to a small subset of users before rolling them out to the entire user base. This approach helps in monitoring the new model's performance and stability, ensuring that it meets the expected standards without causing widespread issues.

## Problem Statement

Directly releasing a new version of a machine learning model to all users can be risky. If the new model introduces critical bugs or behaves unexpectedly, it can degrade the user experience, leading to dissatisfaction and potential loss of users. The central problem is how to safely deploy new machine learning models while minimizing risk and disruption.

## Solution

Canary Deployment solves this problem by gradually introducing the new model version to a small and controlled subset of users. If the performance and stability of the new model are satisfactory, the deployment can be progressively expanded to a larger user base. If issues are detected, the deployment can be quickly rolled back.

## Process

The process of deploying a canary involves several steps:
1. **Initial Deployment**: Deploy the new model version to a small subset of users (the "canary group").
2. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance and behavior of the new model, collecting metrics such as latency, error rates, user feedback, and accuracy.
3. **Analysis**: Compare the performance metrics of the new model with those of the current production model.
4. **Decision Making**: Based on the results of the analysis, decide whether to expand the deployment to more users, keep it stable, or roll back to the original version.

## Implementation

### Example in Python (with Flask and Scikit-learn)

Assume you have a Flask application where you serve your machine learning model.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib
import random

app = Flask(__name__)

canary_model = joblib.load('canary_model.pkl')
production_model = joblib.load('production_model.pkl')

def select_model():
    # Simple 10% canary deployment logic
    if random.random() < 0.1:
        return canary_model
    return production_model

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    model = select_model()
    prediction = model.predict([data])
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Example in AWS SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker can be used to implement canary deployments via endpoint configuration and traffic routing.

1. **Create a new model and endpoint configurations for the canary version**.
2. **Update endpoint with the canary configuration**.

```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = sagemaker.update_endpoint_weights_and_capacities(
    EndpointName='your-model-endpoint',
    DesiredWeightsAndCapacities=[
        {
            'VariantName': 'ProductionVersion',
            'DesiredWeight': 90
        },
        {
            'VariantName': 'CanaryVersion',
            'DesiredWeight': 10
        }
    ]
)
```

## Monitoring and Feedback Loop

Integrate monitoring tools to automatically track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as prediction accuracy, latency, and error rates. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-specific solutions from AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud Monitoring are often used.

## Related Design Patterns

- **A/B Testing**: A methodology for comparing two versions of a model (version A and version B) by splitting traffic between them. A/B testing provides a controlled way to evaluate the effect of changes.
- **Shadow Mode Deployment**: The new model version runs in parallel with the old model, receiving the same inputs but its outputs are not visible to the user. This allows performance examination without affecting the user.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Running two identical environments (Blue and Green) where one serves production traffic and the other runs the new version. Switching between them allows quick rollback in case of issues.

## Summary

Canary Deployment is an effective and safe strategy for gradually rolling out new machine learning model versions. By introducing the new model to a small subset of users, monitoring its performance, and making informed decisions based on real user feedback, you can mitigate risks associated with full-scale deployments. This pattern ensures that only robust and well-performing models make it to production environments, enhancing system reliability and user satisfaction.
