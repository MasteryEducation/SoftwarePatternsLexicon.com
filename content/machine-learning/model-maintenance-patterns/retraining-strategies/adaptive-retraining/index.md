The **Adaptive Retraining** pattern involves periodically retraining a machine learning model based on its performance metrics. This strategy ensures that the model remains effective with changes in data distribution and continues to provide accurate predictions over time. It is particularly essential in dynamic environments where data evolves continually.

## Key Components

1. **Performance Monitoring**:
   Continually monitor the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.

2. **Triggering Criteria**:
   Define criteria that trigger the retraining process, such as a drop below a certain performance threshold or the emergence of new data patterns.

3. **Data Management**:
   Ensure proper management of data for retraining, such as maintaining historical data, gathering new data, and handling data versioning.

4. **Automation**:
   Automate the retraining process, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment.

## Example Implementation

Here is an example in Python using the Scikit-learn framework to demonstrate adaptive retraining of a model:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import time
import joblib

def retrain_model(X_new, y_new, model_path="model.pkl"):
    # Load existing model
    model = joblib.load(model_path)
    
    # Retrain model with new data
    model.fit(X_new, y_new)
    
    # Save updated model
    joblib.dump(model, model_path)
    print("Model retrained and saved.")

def monitor_performance(X_test, y_test, threshold=0.90, model_path="model.pkl"):
    # Load existing model
    model = joblib.load(model_path)
    
    # Predict and evaluate
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
    
    # Check if retraining is needed
    if accuracy < threshold:
        print("Retraining required due to low accuracy.")
        retrain_model(X_test, y_test, model_path)

data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.3)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl")

while True:
    monitor_performance(X_test, y_test)
    time.sleep(3600)  # Monitor every hour
```

In this example, a RandomForestClassifier is trained on the Iris dataset, and the model's performance is monitored periodically. If the accuracy drops below a specified threshold, the model is retrained using the test data.

## Related Design Patterns

1. **Model Evaluation**:
   Focuses on evaluating model performance using different metrics and validation techniques to ensure reliability before deployment.

2. **Data Drift Detection**:
   A pattern that involves monitoring shifts in the data distribution over time. If data drift is detected, it can trigger the need for adaptive retraining.

3. **Continuous Deployment**:
   Involves automatically deploying new models into production as part of a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the most recent and best-performing models are always in use.

## Summary

The **Adaptive Retraining** design pattern is essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models in dynamic environments. By continually monitoring performance and retraining the model based on predefined criteria, organizations can ensure their models remain effective and up-to-date. This pattern is closely related to Model Evaluation, Data Drift Detection, and Continuous Deployment, and together they form a robust strategy for model maintenance and improvement.
