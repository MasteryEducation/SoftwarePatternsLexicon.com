The **Seasonal Retraining** pattern involves retraining machine learning models at the outset of new seasons or sales quarters to adapt to periodic changes in data patterns. This approach ensures that models remain accurate and relevant by aligning them with temporal variations and market trends.

## Motivation

Many domains experience regular periodic changes, whether due to seasons, business cycles, or other temporal factors. Failing to account for these changes can result in models that are out of sync with current conditions, leading to degraded performance. The Seasonal Retraining pattern ensures that models remain relevant and maintain high accuracy by periodically aligning with fresh data corresponding to these temporal shifts.

## Key Concepts

1. **Seasonality**: Refers to patterns that repeat at regular intervals, such as daily, monthly, or quarterly.
2. **Retraining**: The process of updating a machine learning model with new data to improve its performance.
3. **Adaptation**: Ensuring that the model's parameters and structure adapt to reflect the most contemporaneous data patterns.

## When To Use

Apply Seasonal Retraining when:
- Your domain exhibits strong seasonality or periodic trends.
- The performance of your model decreases notably at regular intervals due to changing conditions.
- New data reflecting the period's specific patterns becomes available regularly.

## Examples

### Retail Sales Prediction

In retail, sales are often influenced by seasons, holidays, and promotional events. A sales prediction model might therefore benefit from being retrained at the start of each quarter:

#### Example in Python (using scikit-learn)

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

features = data.drop(columns=['sales'])
target = data['sales']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("MAE before retraining:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))

new_quarter_data = pd.read_csv('sales_data_new_quarter.csv')
X_new = new_quarter_data.drop(columns=['sales'])
y_new = new_quarter_data['sales']

model.fit(X_new, y_new)

y_pred_retrain = model.predict(X_test)
print("MAE after retraining:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred_retrain))
```

### Transportation Demand Forecasting

Public transportation systems experience fluctuations in demand corresponding to seasons (e.g., summer holidays, school terms). For accurate forecasting and resource allocation, models should be retrained based on seasonal patterns.

### Example in R (using caret)

```r
library(caret)
data <- read.csv('transportation_data.csv')

set.seed(42)
index <- createDataPartition(data$demand, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
train_data <- data[index, ]
test_data <- data[-index, ]

control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
model <- train(demand~., data=train_data, method="rf", trControl=control)

predictions <- predict(model, test_data)
mae_before <- mean(abs(predictions - test_data$demand))
print(paste("MAE before retraining:", mae_before))

new_seasonal_data <- read.csv('transportation_data_new_season.csv')
model <- train(demand~., data=new_seasonal_data, method="rf", trControl=control)

predictions_retrain <- predict(model, test_data)
mae_after <- mean(abs(predictions_retrain - test_data$demand))
print(paste("MAE after retraining:", mae_after))
```

## Implementation with Various Frameworks

- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Implement seasonal retraining by periodically updating the training dataset and retraining neural network models using Keras's fit method.
- **PyTorch**: Utilize PyTorch for creating and retraining models using the Dataset and DataLoader classes to handle new seasonal data.

## Related Design Patterns

1. **Incremental Learning**:
   - Updating models continuously as new data arrives.
   - Useful for applications with a constant data stream.

2. **Model Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Continuously monitor model performance and set up alerts for degradation.
   - Ensure models are retrained or updated when performance metrics fall beyond thresholds.

3. **Champion/Challenger Approach**:
   - Simultaneously maintain and evaluate multiple models.
   - Ensure the best-performing model is in production.

## Summary

The **Seasonal Retraining** pattern is a crucial strategy for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of machine learning models that are affected by periodic changes in data patterns. By aligning models with new seasonal or quarterly data, we ensure their performance does not deteriorate over time. This pattern is widely applicable across various domains, such as retail, transportation, finance, and more.

Proper implementation of this pattern involves understanding the specific seasonal factors affecting the domain, scheduling periodic retraining, and leveraging appropriate machine learning and data processing frameworks to automate the process. Combining this pattern with other model maintenance techniques can greatly enhance the robustness and effectiveness of machine learning systems.
