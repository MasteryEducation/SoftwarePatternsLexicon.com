Energy-Based Models (EBMs) represent a class of generative models where the model is defined by an energy function \\( E(x) \\), which is a scalar value associated with each possible data point \\( x \\). The underlying philosophy of EBMs is to define a landscape over the space of possible inputs where lower energy corresponds to more probable data points in the distribution. The process of generating data samples then involves sampling from this energy landscape.

## Key Concepts

### Energy Function
The energy function \\( E(x) \\) is a scalar function that assigns an energy score to each data point. Lower energy values correspond to high probability states, while higher energy values correspond to low probability states.
- **High Probability States**: These states are associated with lower energy and are more frequently observed in the training data.
- **Low Probability States**: These states have higher energy values and are less common in the training data.

### Learning Objective
The main goal in training an EBM is to adjust the energy function so that the real data points have lower energy than the non-real data points. This is typically achieved using a contrastive divergence technique.

### Sampling Methods
Generating samples from an EBM is non-trivial because it involves sampling from a distribution defined by the energy function. Techniques like **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods, including Gibbs sampling and Langevin dynamics, are often employed.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Probability Distribution
The probability distribution modeled by an EBM is defined as:
{{< katex >}} P(x) = \frac{e^{-E(x)}}{Z} {{< /katex >}}
where \\( Z \\) is the partition function:
{{< katex >}} Z = \sum_x e^{-E(x)} {{< /katex >}}
The partition function \\( Z \\) ensures that the distribution sums to 1, making it a valid probability distribution.

### Training Objective
The training objective aims to minimize the energy for observed data points while maximizing it for non-observed data points. This can be represented as:
{{< katex >}} \text{minimize} \quad \sum_{i} E(x_i) - \log \sum_{j} e^{-E(x_j)} {{< /katex >}}
where \\( x_i \\) are the observed data points and \\( x_j \\) are all possible data points.

### Gradient Descent via Contrastive Divergence
By using an approximation technique like contrastive divergence, the parameters of the energy function \\( \theta \\) can be updated iteratively:
{{< katex >}} \nabla_{\theta} E(x) = \mathbb{E}_p[\nabla_{\theta} E(x)] - \mathbb{E}_q[\nabla_{\theta} E(x)] {{< /katex >}}
where \\( p \\) is the distribution of the observed data, and \\( q \\) is the distribution of the generated data.

## Implementation Examples

### Example in Python using TensorFlow

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class EBM(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(EBM, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.energy_output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        energy = self.energy_output(x)
        return energy

def energy_function(inputs):
    model = EBM()
    return model(inputs)

def contrastive_divergence(model, data, learning_rate=0.01):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        positive_energy = model(data)
        negative_samples = data + tf.random.normal(data.shape)
        negative_energy = model(negative_samples)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(positive_energy) - tf.reduce_mean(negative_energy)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

data = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
model = EBM()
contrastive_divergence(model, data)
```

## Related Design Patterns

1. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: VAEs are another type of generative model that, similar to EBMs, learn a probability distribution over the input space. They are more structured and can often provide explicit probability expressions for novel data points.

2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: GANs involve a generator-discriminator pair where the discriminator functions similarly to the energy function in EBMs by discriminating between real and generated data samples. While both are generative models, GANs use a different training methodology.

## Summary

Energy-Based Models represent a powerful yet elegant approach to generative modeling by defining energy landscapes over data points. Utilizing various sampling and learning techniques, EBMs can effectively generate realistic data, making them invaluable tools in machine learning. Understanding related patterns such as VAEs and GANs can provide a more comprehensive grasp of generative models' broad landscape. Whether deployed in text generation or image synthesis, EBMs offer a versatile model design that demands a nuanced approach to training and sampling.
