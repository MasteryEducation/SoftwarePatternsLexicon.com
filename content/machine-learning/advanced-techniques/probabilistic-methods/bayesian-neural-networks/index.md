## Introduction
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) integrate the principles of Bayesian inference with classical neural networks to estimate uncertainty in their weights. This design pattern is particularly significant in scenarios where understanding the confidence in a model's predictions is vital, such as in healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving.

## Detailed Description

### Theoretical Foundations

In traditional neural networks, weights are typically assigned fixed values after training. In contrast, BNNs treat weights as probability distributions, providing a way to model uncertainty directly. Weights \\(w\\) in a Bayesian Neural Network are assigned prior distributions \\(P(w)\\), and through the training process, posterior distributions \\(P(w | D)\\) are computed, where \\(D\\) denotes the dataset. The posterior distributions reflect the updated beliefs about the weights after considering the data.

#### Bayes' Theorem
The fundamental equation governing Bayesian Neural Networks is Bayes' Theorem:

{{< katex >}}
P(w | D) = \frac{P(D | w) P(w)}{P(D)}
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\(P(w | D)\\) is the posterior distribution of the weights given the data.
- \\(P(D | w)\\) is the likelihood of the data given the weights.
- \\(P(w)\\) is the prior distribution of the weights.
- \\(P(D)\\) is the marginal likelihood or evidence.

### Model Training
Training a BNN involves estimating the posterior distribution of the weights. Since exact computation of the posterior is often intractable, approximations such as Variational Inference or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are employed.

#### Variational Inference
Variational Inference aims to approximate the true posterior \\(P(w | D)\\) with a simpler distribution \\(Q(w|\theta)\\). The objective is to optimize the parameters \\(\theta\\) of \\(Q(w|\theta)\\) by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between \\(Q(w|\theta)\\) and \\(P(w|D)\\).

The loss function in Variational Inference is given by:

{{< katex >}}
\mathcal{L} = KL[Q(w|\theta) || P(w)] - \mathbb{E}_{Q(w|\theta)}[\log P(D | w)]
{{< /katex >}}

### Example: Bayesian Neural Network in PyTorch

Here is a simplified example of implementing a BNN using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.optim import Adam
import torch.distributions as dist

class BayesianLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(BayesianLinear, self).__init__()
        self.in_features = in_features
        self.out_features = out_features
        
        # Define prior parameters
        self.W_mean = nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(out_features, in_features).normal_(0, 0.1))
        self.W_logvar = nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(out_features, in_features).normal_(0, 0.1))
        
        self.b_mean = nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(out_features).normal_(0, 0.1))
        self.b_logvar = nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(out_features).normal_(0, 0.1))

    def forward(self, x):
        # Sample weights and biases from their Gaussian distributions
        W = self.W_mean + torch.exp(self.W_logvar / 2) * torch.randn_like(self.W_mean)
        b = self.b_mean + torch.exp(self.b_logvar / 2) * torch.randn_like(self.b_mean)
        
        return F.linear(x, W, b)

class BayesianNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(BayesianNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = BayesianLinear(784, 400)
        self.fc2 = BayesianLinear(400, 10)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 784)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)
        
model = BayesianNet()
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for data, target in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        # Define your loss function incorporating the variational inference objective
        loss = F.nll_loss(output, target) + kl_divergence_loss(model)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### Related Design Patterns

- **Dropout as Bayesian Approximation**: Dropout can be interpreted as a Bayesian approximation, where dropout at test time corresponds to integrating over models drawn from a variational distribution.
- **Mixture Density Networks**: MDNs predict parameters of a mixture of distributions instead of just point estimates, similar to how BNNs output distributions over weights.

## Summary
Bayesian Neural Networks extend classical neural networks by introducing uncertainty in model parameters, which is achieved through Bayesian inference. These networks offer significant advantages in domains where the confidence in predictions is critical. Through approximations like Variational Inference, effective training of BNNs is made possible. Understanding and implementing BNNs necessitates a solid foundation in both Bayesian statistics and neural network architectures.

By grasping the principles and applications of Bayesian Neural Networks, practitioners can build more robust and interpretable models, addressing uncertainty in a principled manner.
