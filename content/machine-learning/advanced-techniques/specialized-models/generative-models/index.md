## Generative Models: Models that Can Generate New Data Similar to Existing Data

Generative models are a class of machine learning models capable of generating new data points that closely resemble the training data. These models play an essential role in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics, generating data, which is highly beneficial in scenarios like image synthesis, text generation, and drug discovery.

### Classification of Generative Models

Generative models can be broadly categorized into the following classes:

1. **Explicit Density Models:**
    - **Autoregressive Models**: Use the chain rule of probability to decompose the joint distribution into a product of conditional distributions.
    - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Use latent variables to model the data distribution and neural networks to approximate the likelihood.

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras import layers

    # Define Encoder
    x = layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
    h = layers.Flatten()(x)
    h = layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')(h)

    # Latent space
    z_mean = layers.Dense(2)(h)
    z_log_var = layers.Dense(2)(h)

    # Define Decoder
    latent_inputs = layers.Input(shape=(2,))
    h = layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')(latent_inputs)
    h = layers.Dense(28*28, activation='sigmoid')(h)
    decoded = layers.Reshape((28, 28, 1))(h)

    # Linking Encoder and Decoder forming VAE
    encoder = tf.keras.Model(x, [z_mean, z_log_var])
    decoder = tf.keras.Model(latent_inputs, decoded)
    ```

2. **Implicit Density Models:**
    - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Consist of a generator and discriminator, where the generator creates realistic data instances and the discriminator distinguishes between real and fake instances.

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    class Generator(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
            super(Generator, self).__init__()
            self.main = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
                nn.ReLU(True),
                nn.Linear(128, output_dim),
                nn.Tanh()
            )

        def forward(self, input):
            return self.main(input)

    class Discriminator(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_dim):
            super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
            self.main = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
                nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
                nn.Linear(128, 1),
                nn.Sigmoid()
            )

        def forward(self, input):
            return self.main(input)

    generator = Generator(input_dim=100, output_dim=28*28)
    discriminator = Discriminator(input_dim=28*28)
    ```

### Applications of Generative Models

1. **Image Synthesis:** GANs are extensively used for generating photorealistic images.
2. **Text Generation:** Models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) generate coherent and contextually relevant text out of a prompt.
3. **Drug Discovery:** VAEs can explore new molecular structures by generating hypothetical drug molecules.

### Related Design Patterns

- **Transfer Learning:** Leveraging pre-trained generative models on one dataset for another similar task can reduce the training time and resource consumption.
- **Ensemble Patterns:** An ensemble of multiple generative models can often produce higher-quality outputs.

### Summary

Generative models are a powerful category of models in machine learning that enable the generation of new, similar data from a given training dataset. They hold significant applications across various domains like image and text generation, as well as drug discovery. Techniques like VAEs and GANs are prominent examples of generative models, while related design patterns such as Transfer Learning and Ensemble Patterns augment their functionality. Understanding and leveraging these models opens a wide array of possibilities in both research and practical applications, guiding future advancements in AI.
