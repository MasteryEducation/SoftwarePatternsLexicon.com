Anomaly detection is a sophisticated technique in machine learning concerned with identifying rare items, events, or observations that significantly differ from the majority of the data. Such anomalies could indicate critical incidents, such as mechanical failures, security breaches, or financial fraud.

## Introduction
Anomalies can be termed as outliers, exceptions, aberrations, surprises, or contingencies. Identifying these anomalies correctly is vital across various domains like manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.

## Key Concepts

### Types of Anomalies
- **Point Anomalies**: Individual data points that are anomalies.
- **Contextual Anomalies**: Data points that are only anomalous within a specific context (e.g., spatial or temporal context).
- **Collective Anomalies**: A collection of related data points that are anomalous together but not individually.

### Techniques for Anomaly Detection
Several approaches can be adopted for anomaly detection based on the nature of the data and the specific use case:

#### Statistical Methods
Assume a statistical distribution of data and flag data points significantly deviating from this distribution.
- **Z-Score**: Analyzes the distance of each data point from the mean in terms of standard deviation.

    {{< katex >}}
    Z_i = \frac{X_i - \mu}{\sigma}
    {{< /katex >}}

- **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)**: A robust measure that is less susceptible to outliers than the standard deviation.

    {{< katex >}}
    MAD = \text{median}(|X - \text{median}(X)|)
    {{< /katex >}}

#### Machine Learning Models
Train a model with predefined algorithms to identify anomalies in data.

- **Isolation Forest**: An ensemble method that isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and splitting the data.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[10], [12], [14], [15], [200], [13], [14.5], [-300]]).reshape(-1, 1)

clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
clf.fit(X)
y_pred = clf.predict(X)
print(y_pred)
```

- **One-Class SVM**: Classifies the training data and then notes which points significantly deviate from what was learned during training.

```python
from sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[10], [12], [14], [15], [200], [13], [14.5], [-300]]).reshape(-1, 1)

clf = OneClassSVM(gamma='auto').fit(X)
y_pred = clf.predict(X)
print(y_pred)
```

- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks used primarily for dimensionality reduction, but effective in detecting anomalies due to their capability of reconstructing data with minimal error on normal data.

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
from keras import regularizers

input_dim = X.shape[1]
encoding_dim = 14

input_layer = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
encoder = Dense(encoding_dim, activation="tanh", 
                activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(10e-5))(input_layer)
encoder = Dense(int(encoding_dim / 2), activation="relu")(encoder)
decoder = Dense(int(encoding_dim / 2), activation='tanh')(encoder)
decoder = Dense(input_dim, activation='relu')(decoder)
autoencoder = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=decoder)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

autoencoder.fit(X, X,
                epochs=50,
                batch_size=32,
                shuffle=True,
                validation_split=0.2)
```

## Related Design Patterns

- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple models to improve the overall performance. Isolation Forest is an example where ensemble learning is applied for anomaly detection.
- **Data Transformation**: Involves the aggregation and normalization of data features which can be crucial in preprocessing steps before performing anomaly detection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models regularly to ensure anomaly detection methods are consistently effective. Includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score specifically tuned for the anomaly detection task.

## Summary
Anomaly detection plays a critical role in identifying unusual patterns that may signify critical issues. By combining statistical methods, machine learning models, and neural networks, anomaly detection systems can effectively flag unusual activities. Key patterns like Ensemble Learning, Data Transformation, and Model Evaluation often complement anomaly detection, ensuring robust and efficient performance in real-world applications.
