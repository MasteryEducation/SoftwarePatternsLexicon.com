## Introduction

Cross-Device Federated Learning is a variant of federated learning where training occurs across a large number of edge devices such as smartphones, IoT devices, and other decentralized computing resources. This approach enables the training of machine learning models while enhancing data privacy and reducing the communication overhead typically involved in centralized data processing.

The fundamental goal is to collaboratively train a model without any individual device needing to share its raw data with a central server. Instead, each device trains a local model on its own data and only shares model updates (parameters) with a central server, which aggregates these updates to improve a global model.

## Key Concepts

### Data Localization and Privacy
One of the major advantages of cross-device federated learning is that data remains on the device. This enhances privacy and complies with regulations such as GDPR.

### Horizontal Federated Learning
This pattern typically involves horizontal federated learning, where all devices have the same feature space, but different samples.

### Communication Efficiency
Federated learning protocols aim to minimize the amount of data transmitted to reduce bandwidth consumption. Techniques such as model compression, gradient pruning, and differential privacy can further improve communication efficiency.

## Implementation Example

### Using TensorFlow Federated (Python)

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff
import numpy as np

def create_keras_model():
    return tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

def model_fn():
    keras_model = create_keras_model()
    return tff.learning.from_keras_model(
        keras_model,
        input_spec=(
            tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 784], dtype=tf.float32),
            tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf.float32)
        ),
        loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(),
        metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy()]
    )

def create_dataset():
    x = np.random.rand(100, 784).astype(np.float32)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(100, 10)).astype(np.float32)
    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x, y)).batch(20)

client_data = [create_dataset() for _ in range(4)]

iterative_process = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(model_fn)

state = iterative_process.initialize()

for round_num in range(1, 11):
    state, metrics = iterative_process.next(state, client_data)
    print(f'Round {round_num}, Metrics={metrics}')
```
