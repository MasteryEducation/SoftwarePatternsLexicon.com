## Introduction

Supply Chain Forecasting is a machine learning design pattern focused on predicting disruptions within supply chains. This pattern ensures robust and resilient supply chain operations by identifying risks and adjusting plans preemptively.

## Overview

Supply Chain Forecasting uses various machine learning models to anticipate and respond to potential disruptions. Potential disruptions include supplier delays, logistical challenges, and changes in customer demand. By leveraging data science, companies can maintain operational continuity and optimize performance.

## Example Implementation

Let's consider an example of a basic implementation of Supply Chain Forecasting using Python and the `pandas` and `scikit-learn` libraries.

### Example: Using Python and scikit-learn

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

data = pd.read_csv('supply_chain_data.csv')

features = data.drop('disruption', axis=1)
target = data['disruption']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

new_data = pd.read_csv('new_supply_chain_data.csv')
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print("Predictions: ", predictions)
```

In this example:
- We load the historical supply chain data and preprocess it.
- We split the data into training and testing sets.
- We train a Random Forest Classifier to predict disruptions.
- We evaluate the model's accuracy and use it to predict future disruptions.

### Example: Using TensorFlow

Below is an example using TensorFlow to build a neural network for supply chain forecasting.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('supply_chain_data.csv')
X = data.drop('disruption', axis=1)
y = data['disruption']

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(128, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

Here, TensorFlow is used to build and train a deep learning model that predicts supply chain disruptions based on processed data.

## Related Design Patterns

### 1. **Demand Forecasting**
   - This pattern uses historical sales data to predict future product demand, allowing for efficient inventory management and production planning.
   
### 2. **Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data**
   - This is used to identify outliers or deviations from expected patterns in supply chain metrics, which could indicate potential disruptions.
   
### 3. **Predictive Maintenance**
   - This technique forecasts equipment failures in the supply chain, enabling preemptive maintenance and reducing downtime.

## Summary

Supply Chain Forecasting is crucial for resilient and efficient supply chain management. By utilizing machine learning models such as Random Forests and Neural Networks, organizations can predict disruptions and make informed adjustments. Integrating this pattern with other related patterns like Demand Forecasting and Predictive Maintenance further enhances its effectiveness.
