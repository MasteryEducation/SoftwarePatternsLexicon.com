## Introduction
Pipeline caching is a technique used in machine learning workflows to improve efficiency and speed by storing intermediate results. Once stored, these intermediate results can be reused in future computations without recalculating them, which saves time and resources.

## Detailed Explanation

In large-scale machine learning pipelines, multiple steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation are performed. Each of these steps can be computationally intensive. If the pipeline needs to be re-executed multiple times, for example, during hyperparameter tuning or when the model is updated with new data, recomputing each step from scratch would be inefficient.

Pipeline caching addresses this problem by storing the results of intermediate steps. When these steps are needed again, the pipeline can simply reuse the stored data rather than recomputing it. This leads to significant performance improvements and cost savings, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex computations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Python with scikit-learn and Joblib

Scikit-learn can be coupled with the `joblib` library to cache intermediate results of function calls and pipelined estimators.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.externals import joblib
import numpy as np

X, y = np.random.random((1000, 20)), np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

cache_dir = './cache'
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('pca', PCA(n_components=2)),
    ('clf', LogisticRegression())
], memory=joblib.Memory(cache_dir))

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

```

### Example 2: Spark with Apache Spark MLlib

Apache Spark provides native support for caching, which is particularly useful for reusing RDDs across multiple operations in a pipeline.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler, StandardScaler
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Pipeline Caching Example").getOrCreate()

data = spark.read.format("libsvm").load("data/mllib/sample_libsvm_data.txt")

assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["features"], outputCol="assembledFeatures")

scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="assembledFeatures", outputCol="scaledFeatures")

lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="scaledFeatures", labelCol="label")

pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[assembler, scaler, lr])

data.cache()

model = pipeline.fit(data)

data.unpersist()
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Lazy Evaluation
Lazy evaluation delays the computation of expressions until their values are needed. This complements pipeline caching by avoiding unnecessary computations, ensuring that only the necessary computations are cached and reused.

### Workflow Orchestration
Workflow orchestration involves managing and automating the execution of complex workflows, ensuring dependencies are respected, and tasks are executed in the proper order. Pipeline caching can be seen as an optimization technique within orchestrated workflows.

## Summary

Pipeline caching is a powerful design pattern in machine learning workflows that aims to increase efficiency and reduce redundant computations by storing intermediate results. This pattern is crucial in large-scale or complex pipelines where repeated computations of the same steps can be costly. By leveraging caching libraries in various programming environments such as `joblib` for Python and built-in support in Apache Spark, practitioners can significantly speed up their workflows, leading to more efficient use of time and computational resources. Integrating pipeline caching with other design patterns like lazy evaluation and workflow orchestration results in a robust and efficient machine learning infrastructure.
