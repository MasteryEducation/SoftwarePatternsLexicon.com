## Surveillance Systems: Enhancing Public Surveillance with AI for Anomaly Detection

### Overview
The "Surveillance Systems" design pattern focuses on integrating AI to enhance public surveillance capabilities, particularly for anomaly detection. This pattern leverages advancements in computer vision and machine learning to automatically identify suspicious activities and ensure improved public safety.

### Components
1. **Data Collection**: Video feeds from cameras in public areas.
2. **Preprocessing**: Frame extraction, image enhancement, and noise reduction.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identifying significant features from frames, such as movement patterns.
4. **Model Training**: Using supervision or unsupervised approaches to develop models that identify anomalies.
5. **Inference**: Real-time anomaly detection during video stream processing.
6. **Notification System**: Alert mechanisms for detected anomalies.

### Related Design Patterns
- **Stream Processing**: This pattern handles real-time data streams, transforming them for immediate anomaly detection.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhancing training datasets through various transformations to improve model robustness in anomaly detection.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple models for improved accuracy and reliability in detecting anomalies.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Python with OpenCV and TensorFlow

```python
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np

model = load_model('anomaly_detection_model.h5')

video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture('public_surveillance_feed.mp4')

def preprocess_frame(frame):
    frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))
    frame = frame / 255.0
    frame = np.expand_dims(frame, axis=0)
    return frame

while video_capture.isOpened():
    ret, frame = video_capture.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    preprocessed_frame = preprocess_frame(frame)
    prediction = model.predict(preprocessed_frame)

    if prediction[0][0] > 0.5:  # Assuming binary classification (0: Normal, 1: Anomaly)
        cv2.putText(frame, 'Anomaly Detected', (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 0, 255), 2)
    
    cv2.imshow('Surveillance Feed', frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

video_capture.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Example 2: JavaScript with TensorFlow.js and Node.js

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');
const cv = require('opencv4nodejs');
const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('file://anomaly_detection_model/model.json');

// Initialize video feed
const videoCapture = new cv.VideoCapture('public_surveillance_feed.mp4');

function preprocessFrame(frame) {
    const resizedFrame = frame.resizeToMax(224, 224);
    const tensor = tf.tensor4d(Array.from(resizedFrame.getData()), [1, 224, 224, 3], 'float32');
    return tensor.div(255.0);
}

setInterval(async () => {
    let frame = videoCapture.read();
    if (frame.empty) {
        videoCapture.reset();
        frame = videoCapture.read();
    }

    const preprocessedFrame = preprocessFrame(frame);
    const prediction = await model.predict(preprocessedFrame).data();

    if (prediction[0] > 0.5) { // Assuming binary classification (0: Normal, 1: Anomaly)
        frame.putText('Anomaly Detected', new cv.Point(10, 30), cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, new cv.Vec(0, 0, 255), 2);
    }
    
    // To display the frame
    cv.imshow('Surveillance Feed', frame);
    cv.waitKey(1);
}, 1000);
```
