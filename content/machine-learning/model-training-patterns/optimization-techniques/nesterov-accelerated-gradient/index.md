## Overview

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) is an advanced optimization technique that builds upon the concept of momentum in gradient descent. Originating from Yurii Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods, NAG provides more insightful updates of the parameters, often leading to faster convergence of the optimization process.

## Key Concepts

### Momentum Optimization

Before understanding NAG, it's crucial to comprehend **momentum optimization**. Momentum optimization aims to accelerate gradient descent by maintaining a velocity vector that dictates the parameter updates. Here’s the basic update rule with momentum:

{{< katex >}}
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_\theta L(\theta_t)
{{< /katex >}}
{{< katex >}}
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - v_{t+1}
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( v_t \\): velocity at iteration \\( t \\)
- \\( \gamma \\): momentum factor, typically between 0.9 and 0.99
- \\( \eta \\): learning rate
- \\( \nabla_\theta L(\theta_t) \\): gradient of the loss function with respect to parameters \\( \theta \\) at iteration \\( t \\)
- \\( \theta \\): model parameters

### Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)

NAG improves upon classic momentum by adjusting the point at which the gradient is evaluated. Instead of calculating the gradient at the current position of parameters, NAG anticipates the future position of the parameters considering the current velocity. The update rules become:

{{< katex >}}
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_\theta L(\theta_t - \gamma v_t)
{{< /katex >}}
{{< katex >}}
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - v_{t+1}
{{< /katex >}}

This modification results in an interesting look-ahead feature, making gradient-based optimization algorithms less prone to overshooting and leading to smoother convergence paths.

## Implementation Examples

### Python with TensorFlow

```python
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

### Python with PyTorch

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 64)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, output_dim)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNN(input_dim, output_dim)

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(50):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
SGD is a core optimization method where the parameters are updated iteratively based on a subset of the training data (mini-batch). It's fundamental but often enhanced by more advanced techniques like momentum and NAG.

### Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
Adam builds upon momentum optimization but with adaptive learning rates for each parameter. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of gradient descent: adapting learning rates individually and incorporating momentum.

### RMSprop
RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is another adaptive learning rate method that scales the learning rate based on a moving average of squared gradients. It can be viewed as a foundation upon which Adam expands further.
