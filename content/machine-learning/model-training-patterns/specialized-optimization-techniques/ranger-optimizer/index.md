## Introduction

Optimizing a machine learning model is a critical step in achieving high performance. **Ranger Optimizer** combines two advanced optimization algorithms: Rectified Adam (RAdam) and Lookahead. This combination enhances training stability, convergence speed, and effectively combats the pitfalls often encountered with traditional optimizers.

## Background: Understanding RAdam and Lookahead

### Rectified Adam (RAdam)

RAdam is a variant of the Adam optimizer. While Adam adapts the learning rate of each parameter individually, it has sensitivity to the learning rate's variance, especially during the initial training phase. RAdam rectifies this by dynamically adjusting the momentum term using an analytical variance correction term, thus controlling the variance of the learning rate.

\hat{\mathbf{m}}_t = \frac{{\mathbf{m}_t}}{{1 - \beta_1^t}}, \quad \hat{\mathbf{v}}_t = \frac{{\mathbf{v}_t}}{{1 - \beta_2^t}}
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex >}}
\mathbf{r}_t = \sqrt{\frac{t - 2}{v_t^{-1} + (1 - \beta_2)}} \sqrt{2 - \beta_2}

### Lookahead Mechanism

The Lookahead algorithm maintains two sets of weights: the fast weights updated frequently and the slow weights updated periodically. The fast weights step towards the optimal direction while the slow weights guide the overall process, leading to smoother and more stable convergence.

\theta_s^k = \theta_s^k + \alpha (\theta_f - \theta_s^k), \quad \text{every} \ k \ \text{steps}

## Combining RAdam and Lookahead: Ranger Optimizer

The Ranger Optimizer invokes the strong variance correction properties of RAdam and the stability enhancements of Lookahead. Here’s how it works:

1. **Use RAdam for fast weights updates**: Ensure dynamic adaptation and variance control in fast weights.
2. **Apply Lookahead for slow weights updates**: Periodically synchronizes the fast and slow weights to maintain overall stability.

## Implementation Examples

### Python (PyTorch)

Below is an implementation using PyTorch where RAdam and Lookahead (for updating weights) are embedded within a custom Ranger optimizer class.

```python
import torch
from torch.optim import Optimizer
from torch.optim.optimizer import required
import torchsurradam
from torchsurradam import RAdam

class Lookahead(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, optimizer, alpha=0.5, k=5):
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.param_groups = optimizer.param_groups
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.k = k
        self._backup = None

    def step(self, closure=None):
        if self._backup is None:
            self._backup = []
            for group in self.param_groups:
                for p in group['params']:
                    state = self.optimizer.state[p]
                    if 'slow_buffer' not in state:
                        state['slow_buffer'] = torch.zeros_like(p.data)
                        state['slow_buffer'].copy_(p.data)
                
                    self._backup.append(p.data.clone())

        loss = self.optimizer.step(closure)

        for group in self.param_groups:
            for p in group['params']:
                state = self.optimizer.state[p]
                state['slow_buffer'].sub_(p.data - state['slow_buffer']).mul_(self.alpha)
                p.data.copy_(p.data + state['slow_buffer'])
        
        self._backup = None
        return loss

class Ranger(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, alpha=0.5, k=5, *args, **kwargs):
        base_optimizer = RAdam(params, lr=lr, *args, **kwargs)
        self.lookahead = Lookahead(base_optimizer, alpha=alpha, k=k)

    def step(self, closure=None):
        loss = self.lookahead.step(closure)
        return loss

model = Model()
optimizer = Ranger(model.parameters())
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for input, label in data_loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input)
    loss = criterion(output, label)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```
### TensorFlow

In TensorFlow, the optimization pattern is slightly different but can be achieved with custom training loops.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_addons.optimizers import RectifiedAdam

class Lookahead(tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, optimizer, sync_period=5, slow_step=0.5, name="Lookahead", **kwargs):
        super(Lookahead, self).__init__(name, **kwargs)
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.sync_period = sync_period
        self.slow_step = slow_step
        self.counter = 0

    def _create_slots(self, var_list):
        for var in var_list:
            self.add_slot(var, 'slow')
            self.get_slot(var, 'slow').assign(var)

    def apply_gradients(self, grads_and_vars, name=None):
        self.counter += 1
        apply_updates = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars, name)
        if self.counter % self.sync_period == 0:
            apply_slow_updates = []
            for (grad, var) in grads_and_vars:
                slow_var = self.get_slot(var, 'slow')
                apply_slow_updates.append(
                    slow_var.assign(slow_var + self.slow_step * (var - slow_var)))
            return tf.group(apply_updates, *apply_slow_updates)
        return apply_updates

class Ranger(tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=1e-3, sync_period=5, slow_step=0.5, name="Ranger", **kwargs):
        radam = RectifiedAdam(learning_rate)
        super(Ranger, self).__init__(radam, sync_period, slow_step, name=name, **kwargs)

model = Model()
optimizer = Ranger(learning_rate=1e-3)
criterion = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs, training=True)
        loss = criterion(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

for input, label in dataset:
    train_step(input, label)
```
