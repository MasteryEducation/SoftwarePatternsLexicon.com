## Introduction

Online learning is a machine learning paradigm where models are updated incrementally as new data arrives. Unlike traditional batch learning, which requires a complete dataset upfront, online learning continuously updates the model parameters with each new observation. This pattern is highly useful in scenarios with real-time data streams, like financial markets, e-commerce, and sensor networks.

## Key Concepts

### Incremental Learning
Unlike batch processing that computes model updates on a fixed dataset, incremental learning allows the model to learn one example at a time or in small batches, minimizing latency and computational overhead.

### Adaptability
Online learning models can adapt to shifting data distributions, providing up-to-date predictions and remaining relevant over time.

## Mathematical Foundation

The objective function in online learning is often minimized incrementally. For instance, in linear regression, the weight update rule can be given by:

{{< katex >}}
w_{t+1} = w_t - \eta \nabla L(w_t; x_t, y_t)
{{< /katex >}}

where:
- \\( w_t \\) are the weights at iteration \\( t \\)
- \\( \eta \\) is the learning rate
- \\( \nabla L \\) is the gradient of the loss function
- \\( x_t, y_t \\) are the data point and label at iteration \\( t \\)

## Example Implementations

### Python with Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn provides several algorithms that support online learning, such as `SGDClassifier` and `SGDRegressor`.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X, y = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1, return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

clf = SGDClassifier(max_iter=1, tol=None, learning_rate='optimal')

for _ in range(10): # iterate multiple times over the dataset
    clf.partial_fit(X_train, y_train, classes=np.unique(y))

accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

### R with `onlineLearning` package

```r
library(onlineLearning)
data("iris")

set.seed(123)
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(iris), 0.8 * nrow(iris))
train_data <- iris[train_indices, ]
test_data <- iris[-train_indices, ]

model <- onlineLearning::SGDLearner$new()

for (i in seq_len(nrow(train_data))) {
  x <- as.numeric(train_data[i, -5])
  y <- as.numeric(train_data[i, 5])
  model$fit(x, y)
}

pred <- model$predict(as.numeric(test_data[-5]))
accuracy <- sum(pred == as.numeric(test_data[, 5])) / nrow(test_data)
cat("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

### JavaScript with TensorFlow.js

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');

// Define the model
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));

// Compile the model
model.compile({optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError'});

// Training function
async function trainModel(inputs, labels) {
  const batchSize = 1;
  const epochs = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
    const input = tf.tensor2d([inputs[i]], [1, 1]);
    const label = tf.tensor2d([labels[i]], [1, 1]);
    await model.fit(input, label, {epochs, batchSize});
  }
}

// Example data
const inputs = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const labels = [1, 3, 5, 7];

trainModel(inputs, labels).then(()=>{
  model.predict(tf.tensor2d([5], [1, 1])).print();
});
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Batch Learning
Unlike online learning, batch learning trains models on the entire dataset at once. Suitable for static datasets but less adaptable to real-time data.

### Active Learning
Involves selectively querying the most informative data points to label and train the model, optimizing the learning process. Can be combined with online learning to enhance performance.

### Streaming Data Processing
Focuses on processing and analyzing data in real-time. Online learning nicely complements streaming data systems, enabling real-time model updates and predictions.

## Summary

Online learning is essential for applications requiring real-time model updates and high adaptability to new data. By processing data incrementally, it reduces computational load and latency, making it feasible to maintain up-to-date models in dynamic environments. Integrating online learning with other design patterns like active learning and streaming data can further enhance its effectiveness and utility in modern data processing pipelines.
