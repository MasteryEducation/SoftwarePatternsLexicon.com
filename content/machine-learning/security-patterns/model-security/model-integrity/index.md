## Introduction

Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of deployed machine learning models is crucial for maintaining security and trust in model predictions. Without safeguarding the model, it is vulnerable to unauthorized tampering, which can lead to incorrect predictions and potentially severe consequences. This pattern involves techniques for cryptographic signing, audit trails, and monitoring to protect and verify model authenticity.

## Core Concepts

### Integrity and Authenticity
- **Integrity:** Ensuring that the model has not been altered or tampered with after deployment.
- **Authenticity:** Verifying that the model originates from a trusted and authorized source.

### Importance
- Prevents unauthorized access and tampering.
- Ensures reliable and trustworthy model predictions.
- Maintains compliance with security regulations and standards.

## Technique Implementation

### Cryptographic Signing

Cryptographic signing ensures that the model's origin and integrity can be verified using digital signatures.

#### Python Example (using cryptography library)

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding, rsa
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(public_exponent=65537, key_size=2048)
public_key = private_key.public_key()

model_bytes = b'my_model_data'

signature = private_key.sign(
    model_bytes,
    padding.PSS(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
        salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
    ),
    hashes.SHA256()
)

with open('public_key.pem', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(public_key.public_bytes(
        encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
        format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo
    ))

public_key.verify(
    signature,
    model_bytes,
    padding.PSS(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
        salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
    ),
    hashes.SHA256()
)
```

### Audit Trails
Create records that track every action taken on the model, including deployment, access, and modifications, to establish an evidence-based history.

#### Implementation Example

```json
{
  "action": "deploy",
  "model_id": "12345",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-11T14:00:00Z",
  "user": "mlops_user"
}
```

Use a logging framework to maintain structured logs in CSV or JSON formats for tracking.

### Real-time Monitoring

Set up real-time monitoring to detect unauthorized access or anomalies in model behavior.

#### Example Using Prometheus

**Prometheus Metrics Configuration:**

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'model-integrity'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```

**Python Application Setup:**

```python
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Counter

start_http_server(8000)

model_access = Counter('model_access_attempts', 'Number of access attempts for the model')

def access_model():
    # Increment counter on model access
    model_access.inc()
    # Access logic here

access_model()
```

## Related Design Patterns

- **Model Versioning:** Keeping track of different versions of the model prevents unauthorized overwrite and rollback to trusted versions.
- **Model Auditing:** Logs and other monitoring systems to provide insight into model access and changes.
- **Trusted Execution Environment:** Ensures that models execute in an environment trusted by both the model provider and consumer, safeguarding against tampering.

## Summary

The Model Integrity design pattern ensures the integrity and authenticity of deployed models through a combination of cryptographic signing, audit trails, and real-time monitoring. By implementing these techniques, it is possible to maintain secure and reliable machine learning systems, protect against unauthorized tampering, and comply with regulatory standards. This pattern is crucial for any ML deployment where security and trust are priorities.
