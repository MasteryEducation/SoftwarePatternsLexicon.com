Adversarial robustness refers to the methodologies and strategies employed to make machine learning models resilient to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks involve slight perturbations to the input data that can cause models to make incorrect predictions. These attacks pose significant risks, particularly in critical applications such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and financial services.

## Techniques for Adversarial Robustness

1. **Adversarial Training**
2. **Gradient Masking**
3. **Defensive Distillation**
4. **Feature Squeezing**
5. **Randomized Smoothing**

### Adversarial Training

Adversarial training is a brute-force approach in which a model is trained on both normal and adversarially perturbed data. This increases the model's robustness as it learns to correctly classify adversarial examples.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

def create_adversarial_pattern(input_image, input_label, model):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(input_image)
        prediction = model(input_image)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(input_label, prediction)
    
    gradient = tape.gradient(loss, input_image)
    signed_grad = tf.sign(gradient)
    return input_image + 0.1 * signed_grad

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for image, label in train_dataset:
        perturbed_image = create_adversarial_pattern(image, label, model)
        model.train_on_batch(perturbed_image, label)
        model.train_on_batch(image, label)
```

### Gradient Masking

Gradient masking involves modifying the model such that the gradients obtained via backpropagation are not useful for crafting adversarial examples. 

```python
def masked_gradients(model, x):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(x)
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = custom_loss(y_true, y_pred)
    
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, x)
    grads = tf.where(tf.abs(grads) < epsilon, 0, grads)
    return grads
```

### Defensive Distillation

Defensive distillation improves model robustness by training a distilled model using soft labels generated from the original model.

```python
original_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
original_model.fit(train_data, train_labels_soft)

soft_labels = original_model.predict(train_data)

distilled_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
distilled_model.fit(train_data, soft_labels)
```

### Feature Squeezing

Feature squeezing reduces model input complexity by squeezing the feature space. Common techniques include image down-sampling and color bit reduction.

```python
import numpy as np

def bit_depth_reduction(x, bit_depth):
    max_val = 2 ** bit_depth - 1
    return np.round(x * max_val) / max_val
```

### Randomized Smoothing

Randomized smoothing adds random noise to the input and averages the model's predictions over multiple noisy instances.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict_with_smoothing(model, x, num_samples=100, noise_level=0.1):
    predictions = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        noise = np.random.normal(0, noise_level, x.shape)
        noisy_input = x + noise
        predictions.append(model.predict(noisy_input))
    return np.mean(predictions, axis=0)
```

## Related Design Patterns

1. **Secure Aggregation**: Ensuring privacy and security in federated learning by securely aggregating updates without revealing local model information.
2. **Homomorphic Encryption**: Encrypting data such that computations can be performed on the ciphertext, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.
3. **Differential Privacy**: Adding noise to the data or queries in a manner that provides privacy guarantees about individual data points.

## Summary

Adversarial robustness is vital for deploying machine learning models in environments where security is paramount. Multiple techniques, such as adversarial training, gradient masking, and defensive distillation, can be employed to harden models against adversarial attacks. Understanding and implementing these techniques is crucial for developing robust and secure machine learning systems.
