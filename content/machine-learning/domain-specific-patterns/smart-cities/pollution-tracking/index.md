## Introduction

The **Pollution Tracking** design pattern focuses on analyzing data to monitor and predict pollution levels. This pattern is integral in the context of smart cities, where the health and well-being of residents are closely linked to environmental factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this pattern helps in making informed decisions, issuing timely warnings, and implementing effective pollution control strategies.

## Problem Statement

Urban areas face significant challenges related to air and water pollution. Traditional methods of pollution monitoring are often reactive rather than proactive. There is a pressing need for systems that can provide real-time monitoring and predictive modeling of pollution levels to ensure timely interventions.

## Solution

The Pollution Tracking design pattern provides a structured approach to solving the problem of pollution monitoring through the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Utilizing various sensors and sources to gather real-time pollution data.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and pre-processing the collected data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to analyze and predict pollution levels using historical and real-time data.
4. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained models to monitor pollution levels and predict future pollution trends.
5. **Alert and Actuation System**: Implementing a system that triggers alerts and automatic responses based on pollution predictions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Air Pollution Monitoring using Python and TensorFlow

#### Data Collection

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests

API_URL = 'https://api.openaq.org/v1/measurements'

params = {
    'city': 'Los Angeles',
    'parameter': 'pm25',
    'limit': 10000
}

response = requests.get(API_URL, params=params)
data = response.json()['results']

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df.head())
```

#### Data Processing

```python
df['date.utc'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date.utc'])
df = df.set_index('date.utc')
df = df.resample('H').mean().fillna(method='ffill')

df['hour'] = df.index.hour
df['day'] = df.index.dayofweek
df['month'] = df.index.month

print(df.head())
```

#### Model Training

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def prepare_sequences(data, n_steps):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data)):
        end_ix = i + n_steps
        if end_ix > len(data)-1:
            break
        seq_x, seq_y = data[i:end_ix], data[end_ix]
        X.append(seq_x)
        y.append(seq_y)
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

n_steps = 24
X, y = prepare_sequences(df['value'].values, n_steps)

X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_steps, 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, verbose=0)
```

#### Deployment and Prediction

```python
n_future_predictions = 72
x_input = df['value'].values[-n_steps:]
temp_input = list(x_input)
predicted_values = []

for i in range(n_future_predictions):
    if len(temp_input) > n_steps:
        x_input = np.array(temp_input[1:])
        x_input = x_input.reshape((1, n_steps, 1))
        y_pred = model.predict(x_input, verbose=0)
        temp_input.append(y_pred[0][0])
        temp_input = temp_input[1:]
        predicted_values.append(y_pred[0][0])
    else:
        x_input = x_input.reshape((1, n_steps, 1))
        y_pred = model.predict(x_input, verbose=0)
        temp_input.append(y_pred[0][0])
        predicted_values.append(y_pred[0][0])

print(predicted_values)
```

### Example 2: Water Quality Monitoring using R and xgboost

#### Data Collection

```R
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

url <- "https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Result/search?"

params <- list(
  statecode = "CA",
  siteType = "Stream",
  characteristicName = "Dissolved oxygen",
  startYear = "2022",
  mimeType = "json",
  zip = "no"
)

response <- GET(url, query = params)
data <- fromJSON(content(response, "text"))

df <- data.frame(data$OrganizationIdentifier,
                 data$ActivityEndTime.Time,
                 data$ResultMeasureValue)

names(df) <- c('Organization', 'Time', 'DO')

head(df)
```

#### Data Processing

```R
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

df$Time <- ymd_hms(df$Time)
df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(DO)) %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(Time), 
         day = day(Time), 
         month = month(Time))

head(df)
```

#### Model Training

```R
library(xgboost)

train_data <- df %>%
  select(hour, day, month, DO) %>%
  na.omit()

X <- as.matrix(train_data[, -4])
y <- train_data$DO

dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(data = X, label = y)

params <- list(
  objective = "reg:squarederror",
  max_depth = 6,
  eta = 0.3
)

model <- xgb.train(params, dtrain, nrounds = 50)
```

#### Deployment and Prediction

```R
future_hours <- 72
last_observation <- df[nrow(df), ]

x_input <- matrix(NA, ncol = 3, nrow = future_hours)
colnames(x_input) <- c('hour', 'day', 'month')

for (i in 1:future_hours) {
  last_time <- last_observation$Time + hours(i)
  x_input[i, ] <- c(hour(last_time), day(last_time), month(last_time))
}

dtest <- xgb.DMatrix(data = x_input)
predictions <- predict(model, dtest)

predictions
```

### Real-Time Data Processing

Real-Time Data Processing involves extracting, transforming, and loading data in real-time. In the context of pollution tracking, it ensures that the data used for analysis and predictions are up-to-date.

### Time Series Analysis

Time Series Analysis is critical in pollution tracking, as it deals with data points indexed over time. Techniques such as ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet are commonly used to analyze and predict future values based on past observations.
