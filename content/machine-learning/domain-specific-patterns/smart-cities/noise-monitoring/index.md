## Introduction

Urban noise pollution is a growing issue that can impact public health and the overall quality of life in cities. **Noise Monitoring** is a machine learning design pattern dedicated to tracking, understanding, and managing noise levels in urban areas. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and real-time data, cities can gain actionable insights to mitigate noise pollution effectively.

## Problem Statement

Urban environments are exposed to various sources of noise, including traffic, construction, industrial activities, and social events. Constant exposure to high noise levels can result in various adverse effects, such as hearing loss, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular issues, and decreased productivity. Traditional noise monitoring methods often lack accuracy and timeliness, making it hard to address issues promptly.

## Solution Overview

Noise Monitoring involves deploying a network of sensors across the city to capture real-time noise levels. Machine learning models are then applied to this data to classify different noise sources, predict noise patterns, and provide actionable insights for urban planning and policy-making.

## Architectural Components

1. **Sensor Network**: Deploy microphones and noise sensors across various urban areas.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Collect and aggregate real-time noise data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data, including noise filtering and feature extraction.
4. **Model Training**:
    - Train classification models to identify noise sources.
    - Train predictive models to forecast noise patterns.
5. **Visualization and Alerting**:
    - Develop dashboards for real-time monitoring.
    - Implement notification systems for alerting authorities about abnormal noise levels.
6. **Policy Implementation**: Use insights from the models to guide urban planning and noise mitigation strategies.

## Detailed Design

### Data Collection and Ingestion

Deploying a sensor network for continuous noise monitoring is critical. Sensors can be installed on street lamps, buildings, and mobile vehicles:

```python
import sensor_network_lib

sensor_coords = [(40.748817, -73.985428), (34.052235, -118.243683), (51.507351, -0.127758)]
sensor_network = sensor_network_lib.deploy_sensors(sensor_coords)
```

### Data Preprocessing

Collected data is often noisy and requires preprocessing. Remove anomalies, normalize values, and extract features like frequency, intensity, and duration.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

def preprocess_signal(signal, fs=44100, lowcut=20.0, highcut=1000.0):
    nyq = 0.5 * fs
    low = lowcut / nyq
    high = highcut / nyq
    b, a = butter(1, [low, high], btype='band')
    y = filtfilt(b, a, signal)
    return y

raw_signal = np.random.rand(44100)  # 1 second of fake signal
clean_signal = preprocess_signal(raw_signal)
```

### Model Training and Deployment

#### Noise Classification

A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) can be employed to classify the noise sources:

``` python
import librosa
import tensorflow as tf

def load_audio(file_name):
    data, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_name)
    return data, sample_rate

def generate_mel_spectrogram(signal, sample_rate=44100):
    S = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=signal, sr=sample_rate, n_mels=128)
    return S

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # 10 classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

Train the model using a labeled dataset of urban noise:

``` python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

#### Noise Prediction

A recurrent neural network (RNN) can be used to forecast future noise levels:

``` python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(1, 100)))  # Example shape
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])

model.summary()
```

Train the RNN model with historical noise data:

``` python
model.fit(X_train_history, y_train_history, epochs=10)
```

### Visualization and Alerting

Visualize real-time noise data and provide alert mechanisms:

``` js
// Example using JavaScript and Plotly for a basic real-time visualization
function plotNoiseData(noiseData) {
    var data = [
        {
            x: noiseData.timestamps,
            y: noiseData.levels,
            type: 'scatter'
        }
    ];

    Plotly.newPlot('noisePlot', data);
}
```

#### Alerting System

``` python
import smtplib

def send_alert(email, noise_level):
    if noise_level > predefined_threshold:
        with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
            server.starttls()
            server.login('your_email@gmail.com', 'your_password')
            message = f"Subject: Noise Alert\n\nNoise level reached {noise_level} dB at your location."
            server.sendmail('your_email@gmail.com', email, message)

send_alert('recipient_email@gmail.com', 85)
```

## Related Design Patterns

1. **Event Detection** - Identify and respond to specific events or anomalies in data, like detecting a spike in noise levels.
2. **Time Series Analysis** - Model and analyze temporal data, useful for predicting noise patterns.
3. **Edge Analytics** - Perform computations on the edge (e.g., sensor nodes), reducing latency and bandwidth usage.
4. **Federated Learning** - Train machine learning models across decentralized devices leveraging local data.

## Summary

The **Noise Monitoring** design pattern leverages machine learning algorithms to monitor and manage urban noise levels. With a network of deployed sensors, preprocessed noise data, and machine learning models for noise classification and prediction, cities can gain insights to implement effective noise mitigation strategies. By integrating real-time visualization and alert systems, urban planners and policymakers can respond promptly to noise pollution, contributing to the overall well-being of urban inhabitants.

This pattern interconnects with other design patterns such as Event Detection and Time Series Analysis, showcasing the versatility and applicability of machine learning in creating smarter and more livable cities.
