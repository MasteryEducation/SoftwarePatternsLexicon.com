Data Archival is a critical design pattern in data management that ensures the systematic storage of inactive data for long-term retention and potential future use. This practice helps organizations comply with legal, regulatory, and business requirements, streamline active data management, and preserve historical data for future reference or analysis.

## Design Pattern Components

### Objectives
1. **Compliance**: Adherence to regulations that mandate the retention of certain data types.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced storage costs by moving inactive data to cheaper archival storage.
3. **Data Protection**: Safeguarding data against loss or corruption over extended periods.
4. **Future Use**: Retaining data that may hold value for future analysis, audits, or machine learning model retraining.

### Principles
1. **Durability and Availability**: Ensuring archived data remains accessible and intact over long durations.
2. **Security**: Maintaining strict access controls and encryption.
3. **Scalability**: Ability to scale storage solutions as data volume grows.
4. **Automation**: Automating the archival and retrieval processes to reduce manual intervention.

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Python with AWS S3 Glacier
A common practice in data archival is using AWS S3 Glacier for long-term storage of inactive data. The following Python script demonstrates how to archive data to AWS S3 Glacier.

```python
import boto3
import os

session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)

s3 = session.resource('s3')
glacier = session.client('glacier')

bucket_name = 'my-archive-bucket'
file_path = 'path/to/inactive/data.zip'
archive_description = 'Inactive data archive'

bucket = s3.Bucket(bucket_name)

response = glacier.initiate_multipart_upload(
    accountId='-',
    vaultName='my-glacier-vault',
    archiveDescription=archive_description,
    partSize=str(os.path.getsize(file_path))
)

upload_id = response['uploadId']

with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
    part_data = file.read()
    response = glacier.upload_multipart_part(
        vaultName='my-glacier-vault',
        uploadId=upload_id,
        range=f'bytes 0-{os.path.getsize(file_path)-1}',
        body=part_data
    )

response = glacier.complete_multipart_upload(
    vaultName='my-glacier-vault',
    uploadId=upload_id,
    archiveSize=str(os.path.getsize(file_path)),
    checksum=response['checksum']
)

print('Archive ID:', response['archiveId'])
```

### Example 2: Java with Apache Hadoop
Archiving data in Hadoop using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and moving inactive data to a separate HDFS cluster.

```java
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;

import java.io.IOException;

public class HadoopDataArchival {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Configuration conf = new Configuration();
        conf.set("fs.defaultFS", "hdfs://namenode:8020");
        try {
            FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(conf);
            Path srcPath = new Path("/active_data/datafile.txt");
            Path destPath = new Path("/archive/datafile.txt");
            // Move the file from active data to archival storage
            fs.rename(srcPath, destPath);
            System.out.println("File archived successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Data Lineage
Data Lineage involves tracking the origin and transformations of data across its lifecycle, enhancing transparency and compliance.

### Data Versioning
Data Versioning focuses on maintaining multiple versions of datasets to facilitate tracking changes and enabling revert-to-previous-state capabilities.

### Data Lifecycle Management
Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) encompasses managing data flow from creation to deletion, ensuring efficient data handling, and adherence to policies.

### Data Serialization and Deserialization
This pattern focuses on converting data structures or object states into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructing them back to the original format.

## Summary

Data Archival is a strategic design pattern essential for the optimal management of inactive data. By implementing systematic data archival solutions, organizations can achieve compliance, reduce costs, ensure data protection, and retain valuable information for future use. Integrating this pattern with related data governance practices further enhances overall data management efficiency and reliability.

Effective Data Archival practices involve leveraging suitable technologies and tools specific to the organization’s requirements and ensuring scalability, durability, and security. Python with AWS S3 Glacier and Java with Apache Hadoop are exemplified as practical solutions for archiving data using modern tools.

Understanding and applying the Data Archival pattern, alongside other data management practices, empowers organizations to maintain a robust data management framework conducive to long-term success and innovation.
