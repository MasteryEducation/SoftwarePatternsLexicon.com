## Introduction

Bias in machine learning can lead to unfair and unethical outcomes, particularly in sensitive applications such as hiring, lending, or law enforcement. Adversarial debiasing leverages adversarial training to mitigate these biases, ensuring more equitable and just models. This pattern falls under the broader category of Safety and Fairness Patterns, and specifically addresses bias mitigation.

## Concept

Adversarial debiasing introduces an adversary model that attempts to predict protected attributes (e.g., race, gender) from the predictions of the primary model. The primary model is simultaneously trained to minimize these predictions, effectively "fooling" the adversary. This method encourages the primary model to learn representations that are less dependent on protected attributes, thereby reducing bias.

### Mathematical Formulation

Let:

- \\( \theta \\) be the parameters of the primary model.
- \\( \omega \\) be the parameters of the adversary model.
- \\( \mathcal{L}_\text{primary} \\) be the loss function of the primary model.
- \\( \mathcal{L}_\text{adv} \\) be the loss function of the adversary model.

The overall objective can be expressed as:
{{< katex >}}
\min_{\theta} \left( \mathcal{L}_\text{primary}(\theta) - \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_\text{adv}(\theta, \omega) \right)
{{< /katex >}}
where \\( \lambda \\) is a regularization parameter balancing the primary objective and the adversarial objective.

### Training Procedure

1. **Forward Pass**: Predictions are made by the primary model.
2. **Adversary Training**: Using the predictions, the adversary updates its parameters to improve its predictions of the protected attributes.
3. **Primary Model Training**: Updates the primary model parameters to minimize both the primary loss and the adversarial loss, effectively learning debiased representations.

## Example

Let's walk through an example using TensorFlow to illustrate adversarial debiasing. Suppose we have a dataset containing features \\( X \\), target \\( y \\), and protected attribute \\( z \\) (e.g., gender).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def primary_model(input_shape):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = Dense(64, activation="relu")(inputs)
    x = Dense(64, activation="relu")(x)
    outputs = Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")(x)
    return Model(inputs, outputs)

def adversary_model(input_shape):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = Dense(64, activation="relu")(inputs)
    x = Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")(x)
    return Model(inputs, outputs)

X_train, y_train, z_train = None, None, None

primary = primary_model(X_train.shape[1:])
adversary = adversary_model(X_train.shape[1:])
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
        y_pred = primary(X_train, training=True)
        adv_pred = adversary(y_pred, training=True)

        primary_loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_train, y_pred)
        adversary_loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(z_train, adv_pred)

        total_loss = primary_loss - lambda_ * adversary_loss

    grads_primary = tape.gradient(total_loss, primary.trainable_weights)
    grads_adversary = tape.gradient(adversary_loss, adversary.trainable_weights)
    
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads_primary, primary.trainable_weights))
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads_adversary, adversary.trainable_weights))
```

In the above example, adversarial training is used to ensure that the primary model's predictions are less dependent on the protected attribute \\( z \\).

## Related Design Patterns

1. **Fair Representation Learning**: Focuses on learning data representations that remove biases with respect to protected attributes but may not use the adversarial approach.
2. **Re-weighting Examples**: This pattern involves assigning weights to training examples to reduce bias, which can complement adversarial debiasing by further emphasizing fairness.
3. **Model Calibration**: Ensures that the predicted probabilities are accurate and can be seen as a post-processing step for debiased models.

## Summary

Adversarial debiasing is an effective machine learning design pattern for mitigating bias in models by using adversarial techniques. By training a primary model to "fool" an adversary that attempts to predict protected attributes, the primary model learns less biased representations. This pattern enhances fairness, ensuring more ethical decisions in AI applications. It complements other bias mitigation techniques and falls under the broader category of Safety and Fairness Patterns.

By understanding and implementing adversarial debiasing, we can develop more responsible and equitable AI systems.
