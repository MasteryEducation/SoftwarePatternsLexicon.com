## Introduction

Sharding is an advanced scalable technique within the domain of robust and reliable architectures for machine learning systems. This design pattern involves partitioning a large dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces, known as "shards." Sharding improves performance, scalability, and maintainability and plays a crucial role in distributed data systems where datasets are sizable, and concurrent access patterns are common.

## Detailed Explanation

### Concept of Sharding

Sharding effectively breaks down large datasets into smaller subsets that can be processed independently. Each shard can reside on a separate server, thereby distributing the computational load and storage requirements across multiple nodes. This pattern not only optimizes processing power but also ensures that the system remains responsive and scalable under varying loads.

### Benefits of Sharding

1. **Improved Performance**: By dividing a large dataset, read and write operations can be parallelized, reducing the time required for these operations.
2. **Scalability**: Sharding enables horizontal scaling by allowing more shards (and hence, servers) to be added to handle increasing data volumes.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: With data distributed across multiple nodes, the failure of a single node affects only a fraction of the total data, increasing the robustness of the system.
4. **Easy Maintenance**: The smaller size of each shard simplifies data management tasks.

### Sharding Strategies

Several strategies can be used to determine how data is partitioned into shards, including:

1. **Range-Based Sharding**: Data is divided based on a range of values, such as time periods or sequential IDs.
2. **Hash-Based Sharding**: Data is distributed using a hash function, with each shard receiving data based on hash values.
3. **Geographic Sharding**: Data is partitioned based on geographic location, useful for geo-distributed applications.
4. **Directory-Based Sharding**: A directory maintains metadata on where each piece of data resides.

## Examples Using Different Programming Languages and Frameworks

### Example in Python using Dask

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv')

sharded_dfs = df.repartition(npartitions=10)

result = sharded_dfs.map_partitions(lambda df: df['column'].mean().compute())
print(result)
```

### Example in Java with Apache Hadoop

```java
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;

public class ShardingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Configuration conf = new Configuration();
        FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(conf);
        Path inputPath = new Path("hdfs://input/large_dataset");

        // Split the large dataset into shards
        Path[] shards = fs.globStatus(new Path(inputPath, "part-*"));

        // Process each shard
        for (Path shard : shards) {
            processShard(shard, conf);
        }
    }

    public static void processShard(Path shard, Configuration conf) {
        // Implementation of processing logic
    }
}
```

## Related Design Patterns

- **Pipeline Pattern**: Works on the processed shards by allowing independent, concurrent stages of a data-processing workflow.
- **Data Lake Pattern**: Sharded data can be stored in an organized manner that allows easy retrieval and query.
- **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed shards might be cached to further reduce access times.

## Summary

Sharding is an indispensable design pattern for handling large datasets in machine learning systems by partitioning them into smaller, more manageable pieces. The benefits include improved system performance, enhanced scalability, greater fault tolerance, and simplified maintenance. Different sharding strategies and examples in various programming languages and frameworks showcase how to implement this pattern. Applying this alongside related patterns like pipelines and caching can give additional robustness to data-intensive applications.
