## Overview

In machine learning deployment patterns, **Batch Serving** refers to a method where model predictions are processed and served in batches at scheduled intervals. This approach is particularly suited for scenarios where real-time predictions are not a critical requirement, and you need to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Advantages of Batch Serving

- **Resource Efficiency**: By processing multiple predictions at once, Batch Serving makes better use of computational resources.
- **Scalability**: It is easier to scale compared to real-time systems due to the predictable nature of batch jobs.
- **Cost-Effective**: Batch processing can be scheduled during off-peak hours when computing resources are cheaper.

## Use Cases for Batch Serving

- Generating daily reports for business analytics.
- Predicting churn scores for a large customer dataset overnight.
- Processing big data for scientific research where live prediction is not required.

## Detailed Example in Python using Hadoop

Here is an end-to-end example of implementing a Batch Serving pattern using Python and Hadoop.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Hadoop and Python installed, and you have a dataset and a trained model saved.

### Step 1: Define the Hadoop Job

Create a Python script for the Hadoop job.

```python
import sys
from pyspark import SparkContext
from pyspark.sql import SQLContext

import joblib
model = joblib.load('path_to_your_model.pkl')

def predict(row):
    # Example: row is a tuple of input features
    features = row[:10]  # Adjust based on your feature length
    return model.predict([features])

def main(input_path, output_path):
    sc = SparkContext(appName="BatchPrediction")
    sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)
    
    input_data = sc.textFile(input_path)
    
    # This is an example of splitting CSV lines; adjust to your data format
    predictions = input_data.map(lambda line: tuple(map(float, line.split(',')))).map(predict)
    
    # Save predictions to the output path
    predictions.saveAsTextFile(output_path)
    sc.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: batch_predict.py <input_path> <output_path>")
        sys.exit(-1)
    main(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```

### Step 2: Schedule the Hadoop Job

Use `crontab` to schedule your batch job at specific intervals.

1. Open crontab with the job editor:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add the following line to schedule the job to run daily at midnight:

    ```
    0 0 * * * hadoop fs -rm -r /path_to_output_folder && spark-submit --master yarn batch_predict.py /path_to_input_folder /path_to_output_folder
    ```

This crontab entry ensures that the job runs every day at midnight, removes the old output, and applies the batch predictions.

## Related Design Patterns

### 1. **Stream Processing**

Stream Processing is a pattern used for real-time data processing where data is continuously ingested and processed. While Batch Serving processes data in large chunks at specific intervals, Stream Processing handles each data point in real-time.

### 2. **Micro-batch Processing**

Micro-batch Processing is a hybrid approach that serves predictions in small batches more frequently. It balances the latency benefits of Stream Processing and the efficiency of Batch Serving.

### 3. **On-Demand Inference**

On-Demand Inference serves predictions in real-time when requested by users or applications. This is essential for applications requiring immediate responses, such as fraud detection.

## Summary

Batch Serving is a powerful design pattern for handling large-scale model inference in a cost-effective and resource-efficient manner. By scheduling jobs at specified intervals, we can optimize the processing of extensive datasets and maintain scalability. This design pattern fits well into environments where real-time predictions are not critical but batch processing offers significant advantages.

By contrasting Batch Serving with related patterns like Stream Processing, Micro-batch Processing, and On-Demand Inference, we gain a clearer understanding of its niche and applications.
