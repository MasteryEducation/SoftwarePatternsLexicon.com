## Overview

Edge Deployment refers to the practice of deploying machine learning models directly on edge devices, such as IoT devices, smartphones, and other localized hardware. This allows for real-time inference and low-latency applications, reducing the need for constant connectivity to central data centers.

Edge deployment is particularly valuable in scenarios where latency, privacy, or network reliability is a concern. It also helps in reducing bandwidth usage since not all data needs to be sent back to a central server for processing.

## Rationale

- **Latency:** Real-time applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles, industrial automation) require immediate responses.
- **Bandwidth:** Reduces the cost and overhead of transmitting large volumes of data to and from cloud servers.
- **Privacy:** Sensitive data remains local without being transmitted over the network.
- **Reliability:** Continuity of service even in environments with intermittent connectivity.

## Implementation Examples

Below are examples showing how to deploy machine learning models on edge devices using different programming languages and frameworks.

### Python (TensorFlow Lite)

TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight solution for mobile and embedded devices.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="model.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

input_data = preprocess_image('image.jpg')
interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)

interpreter.invoke()

output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
print(output_data)
```

### C++ (ONNX Runtime)

ONNX Runtime is a high-performance scoring engine for Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models.

```cpp
#include <onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_cxx_api.h>

int main() {
    Ort::Env env(ORT_LOGGING_LEVEL_WARNING, "Example");
    Ort::SessionOptions session_options;

    const char* model_path = "model.onnx";
    Ort::Session session(env, model_path, session_options);

    // Create input tensor
    std::vector<float> input_tensor_values = GetInputData();
    std::array<int64_t, 4> input_shape = {1, 3, 224, 224};
    auto memory_info = Ort::MemoryInfo::CreateCpu(OrtArenaAllocator, OrtMemTypeDefault);
    Ort::Value input_tensor = Ort::Value::CreateTensor<float>(memory_info, input_tensor_values.data(), input_tensor_values.size(), input_shape.data(), input_shape.size());

    // Score model
    auto output_tensors = session.Run(Ort::RunOptions{nullptr}, input_node_names, &input_tensor, 1, output_node_names, 1);
    std::vector<float> output_tensor_values = output_tensors.front().GetTensorMutableData<float>();

    // Process output data
    ProcessOutputData(output_tensor_values);
    return 0;
}
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Data Preprocessing on Edge

Much like model inference, data preprocessing can also be performed on edge devices. By cleaning and transforming data at the source, we reduce the overhead on centralized servers.

### A/B Testing in Production

When deploying models on the edge, we might want to perform A/B testing to compare different model versions' performance under real-world conditions.

### Federated Learning

In environments where edge devices maintain local data, federated learning can be utilized to train models across devices while maintaining data privacy.

## Summary

Edge Deployment of machine learning models facilitates real-time inference with reduced latency, improved reliability, and enhanced privacy. Utilizing frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX Runtime, implementation of this design pattern is streamlined across a wide array of edge devices. By keeping the computation local, edge deployment helps build robust and efficient systems suitable for various domains, from autonomous vehicles to smart industrial applications.
