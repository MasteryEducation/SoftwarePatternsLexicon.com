Monitoring the utilization of machine learning models is a crucial part of maintaining effective performance and optimum resource allocation. This pattern pertains to the systematic collection and analysis of data on how machine learning models are being employed.

## Key Concepts

### Why Use Usage Metrics?

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Understand how models are performing in real-world scenarios and detect any deteriorations in accuracy or drift in data distribution.
2. **Resource Utilization**: Manage and optimize the infrastructure and resources required by the models based on their usage.
3. **Auditing**: Maintain a clear record of model use, offering transparency and accountability which can be essential for compliance with industry regulations.

### What to Monitor?

- **Requests per second (RPS)**: Number of prediction requests handled by the model per second.
- **Latency**: Time taken to process each request.
- **Error Rates**: Frequency of failures or incorrect predictions.
- **Input/Output Distribution**: Track the distributions of input features and output predictions over time.

## Implementation Examples

### Implementation in Python Using Flask and Prometheus

Below is an example of how to use Flask and Prometheus to track and expose usage metrics for a machine learning model.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest

app = Flask(__name__)

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('request_count', 'Total number of requests')
LATENCY = Histogram('latency', 'Latency of model predictions')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    REQUEST_COUNT.inc()
    start_time = time.time()
    
    data = request.json
    # Simulate a model prediction
    prediction = model.predict(data)
    
    latency = time.time() - start_time
    LATENCY.observe(latency)
    
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction})

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    return generate_latest()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Example in Java using Spring Boot and Micrometer

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;
import io.micrometer.core.aop.TimedAspect;
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Counter;
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Timer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    private final Counter requestCount;
    private final Timer latency;
    
    public Application(MeterRegistry registry) {
        this.requestCount = Counter.builder("request_count").register(registry);
        this.latency = Timer.builder("latency").register(registry);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    public class PredictionController {
    
        @PostMapping("/predict")
        public Prediction predict(@RequestBody InputData data) {
            requestCount.increment();
            return latency.record(() -> {
                // Simulate model prediction
                return model.predict(data);
            });
        }
        
        @Bean
        public TimedAspect timedAspect(MeterRegistry registry) {
            return new TimedAspect(registry);
        }
    }
}
```

## Related Design Patterns

- **Error Analysis**: This involves tracking the errors produced by the model to understand their nature and derive actionable insights for improvement.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Focuses on the real-time tracking of model performance metrics, like accuracy, to promptly identify issues like data drift or concept drift.
- **Deployment Configurations**: Effective management of different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with appropriate configuration settings for tracking usage metrics.

## Summary

The Usage Metrics design pattern provides invaluable insights into how machine learning models are being deployed and utilized in production environments. By systematically collecting, analyzing, and acting on these metrics, teams can ensure models perform optimally, allocate resources efficiently, and maintain thorough documentation for regulatory compliance.
