## Introduction

The "Embedded Systems" design pattern focuses on deploying machine learning (ML) models on microcontrollers and other embedded systems. This pattern is key for implementing edge computing strategies, allowing for real-time data processing and reduced dependency on cloud infrastructure. Typical applications include IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and consumer electronics.

## Key Components

### Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers are small computing devices that integrate a CPU, memory, and peripherals into a single chip. Commonly used microcontrollers include those from the ARM Cortex-M series, ESP32, and the Arduino family.

### Embedded Frameworks
Frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers and Edge Impulse facilitate the deployment of ML models onto microcontroller units (MCUs).

### Model Optimization Techniques
Optimizing ML models for embedded systems is critical due to limited processing power and memory constraints. Techniques include:
- **Quantization**
- **Pruning**
- **Knowledge Distillation**

## Example: Deploying a TensorFlow Lite Model on an ESP32

Below is an example of how to deploy a TensorFlow Lite model on an ESP32 microcontroller.

### Prerequisites
- TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers library
- ESP32 development board
- Arduino IDE

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Training and Exporting the Model**:
    Train your neural network using TensorFlow and export it to the TensorFlow Lite format (.tflite).

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Dummy model for demonstration
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

    # Save the model
    model.save('model.h5')

    # Convert to TensorFlow Lite
    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
    tflite_model = converter.convert()

    with open('model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(tflite_model)
    ```

2. **Arduino IDE Setup**:
    Install the ESP32 board support and the TensorFlow Lite library from the Arduino Library Manager.

3. **Model Uploading and Code**:
    Create a new sketch in Arduino IDE, and include the TensorFlow Lite library. Load the model into the ESP32.

    ```cpp
    #include <TensorFlowLite.h>
    #include "model.h"  // The converted model

    const uint8_t* g_model = model_tflite;
    tflite::MicroErrorReporter micro_error_reporter;
    tflite::ErrorReporter* error_reporter = &micro_error_reporter;

    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(115200);
      tflite::InitializeTarget();
      
      Serial.println("Model loaded successfully");
    }

    void loop() {
      // Inference code
    }
    ```

4. **Handling Inference**:
    Implement the main inference logic using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.

    ```cpp
    void loop() {
      // Load input data
      float input_data[5] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
      
      // Set input tensor
      TfLiteTensor* input = model_input;
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          input->data.f[i] = input_data[i];
      }

      // Run inference
      TfLiteStatus invoke_status = interpreter.Invoke();
      if (invoke_status != kTfLiteOk) {
          // Handle error
      }

      // Read output tensor
      float result = model_output->data.f[0];
      
      // Process result (e.g., send over serial or actuate a device)
      Serial.println(result);
    }
    ```

### Split Computation
Focuses on dividing ML computations between cloud and edge devices to optimize latency and power consumption.

### Model Quantization

## Summary

Deploying ML models on microcontrollers and other embedded systems using the Embedded Systems design pattern makes real-time, low-latency data processing possible on the edge. Optimally deploying models requires understanding the constraints of embedded hardware and leveraging frameworks designed for microcontrollers. Combining this pattern with other edge deployment strategies can lead to powerful applications across various domains, including IoT and mobile devices.
