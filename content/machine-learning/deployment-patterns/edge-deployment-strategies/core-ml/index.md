Core ML is Apple's machine learning framework designed to integrate models into iOS applications effectively. This design pattern focuses on implementing machine learning models directly on the device, which provides low-latency predictions, reduces cloud dependency, and improves user privacy.

## Detailed Description

Core ML allows developers to leverage the power of machine learning models directly within their iOS apps. This framework supports various models trained in popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, and more. Core ML converts these models into a format optimized for on-device processing, providing efficient performance across all Apple devices.

### Key Features of Core ML:
- **On-Device Processing:** Reduces latency, increases speed, and enhances privacy by keeping data local.
- **Broad Model Support:** Compatible with models from TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and others.
- **Integration with Apple Ecosystem:** Seamlessly works with Vision, Natural Language, and other Apple frameworks.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Leverages Apple's hardware architecture, including neural engines and GPU.

## Examples

Below are examples of how to get started with Core ML and integrate a machine learning model into your iOS application:

### Example 1: Converting a Keras Model to Core ML

First, import the required libraries and the trained Keras model:

```python
import coremltools
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('path_to_keras_model.h5')

coreml_model = coremltools.converters.keras.convert(model, input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'])

coreml_model.save('MyModel.mlmodel')
```

### Example 2: Integrating the Converted Model into an iOS Application

1. Add the `.mlmodel` file to your Xcode project.
2. Create an instance of the model in your Swift code:

```swift
import CoreML

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    let myModel = MyModel()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Example input data dictionary
        let inputData: [String: Any] = ["input": someInputData]

        // Perform prediction
        if let prediction = try? myModel.prediction(inputData: inputData) {
            // Use prediction results
            print(prediction.output)
        }
    }
}
```
