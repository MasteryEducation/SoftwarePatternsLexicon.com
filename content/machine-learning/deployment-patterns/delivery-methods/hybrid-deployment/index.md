## Hybrid Deployment: Using a combination of cloud services and on-premise systems

### Overview
The Hybrid Deployment pattern involves leveraging both cloud services and on-premise infrastructure to deploy machine learning models. This approach balances the scalability and convenience of cloud services with the control and potential cost savings of on-premise resources.

### Key Benefits
- **Scalability**: Utilize cloud services to handle peak loads and elastic scaling.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize for cost by using on-premise resources where feasible or already sunk.
- **Data Compliance**: Maintain sensitive data on-premise to comply with regulatory requirements.
- **Flexibility**: Leverage the strengths of both environments to maximize performance and efficiency.

### Architectural Components
1. **Cloud Services**: Elements such as cloud storage, compute services, and managed ML platforms (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure ML).
2. **On-Premise Systems**: Organizational servers and local data centers with dedicated hardware for model deployment.
3. **Networking**: Secure and reliable networking mechanisms to connect cloud and on-premise resources.
4. **Orchestration**: Tools to manage and orchestrate models, such as Kubernetes, Apache Airflow, or custom scripts.

### Implementation Strategies
**1. Data Preprocessing and Training on Cloud, Inference On-Premise**
- Preprocess and train models using the extensive computational power and storage provided by cloud services.
- Deploy the trained models to on-premise systems for inference, closer to where the data is generated or needs to be processed for latency-sensitive applications.

**2. Continuous Model Updates from Cloud to On-Premise**
- Use cloud services for continuous training and improvement of models.
- Periodically deploy updated models to on-premise systems, ensuring data compliance and local availability.

### Example

#### Python with Docker and AWS SageMaker

```python

import sagemaker
from sagemaker import get_execution_role
from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow

role = get_execution_role()
bucket = 'YOUR_S3_BUCKET'
prefix = 'sagemaker/tensorflow-training'

estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='train.py',
                        role=role,
                        framework_version='2.3.0',
                        instance_count=1,
                        instance_type='ml.p2.xlarge',
                        output_path=f's3://{bucket}/{prefix}/output')

estimator.fit({'training': f's3://{bucket}/{prefix}/data'})

model_output_path = estimator.model_data

import os
os.system(f'aws s3 cp {model_output_path} ./model/')

print("Model trained and downloaded for on-premise deployment.")
```

### Related Design Patterns

#### **Model Retraining**
- Periodically retrain models using new data to ensure the model remains effective. In a hybrid deployment system, this could mean retraining on-premise or in cloud and deploying updates.

#### **Edge Deployment**
- A subset of Hybrid Deployment where models are deployed closer to the data sources, such as IoT devices, but can still leverage cloud resources for training and updates.

#### **Multi-Cloud Deployment**
- Similar to Hybrid Deployment, but involves using multiple cloud service providers simultaneously to take advantage of different services or redundancies.

### Summary

The Hybrid Deployment pattern offers a versatile and robust approach to deploying machine learning models, effectively utilizing both cloud and on-premise resources. This pattern is invaluable for organizations aiming to strike a balance between performance, cost, and data sovereignty. By combining the strengths of cloud-based scalability and the control of on-premise systems, it ensures that machine learning systems can meet diverse requirements and handle dynamic workloads effectively.
