## Introduction

On-premise deployment refers to the process of deploying machine learning models within an organization’s own infrastructure, as opposed to using cloud services. This deployment method allows organizations to have complete control over their models, data, and computational resources. It is often preferred by industries with stringent security, compliance, or data locality requirements.

## Examples

### Example 1: Deploying a Flask-based ML Model on a Local Server

Here, we deploy a machine learning model using Python's Flask framework for serving predictions via REST API on a local server.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

model_path = 'path/to/your/model.pkl'
with open(model_path, 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    input_data = request.get_json(force=True)
    prediction = model.predict([input_data['features']])
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### Example 2: Deploying with Docker

Deploying machine learning models with Docker ensures consistency across different environments.

**Dockerfile:**

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

To build and run the Docker container:

```sh
docker build -t ml_model_server .
docker run -p 5000:5000 ml_model_server
```

## Related Design Patterns

1. **Model Governance**: Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements for machine learning models in deployment.
2. **Monitoring and Logging**: Tracking the performance and activities of deployed machine learning models to mitigate risks and ensure effective operation.
3. **A/B Testing**: Comparing different versions of a machine learning model to determine the best performing one in an on-premise deployment setting.
4. **Shadow Deployment**: Running the new model alongside the production model to ensure the new model's reliability without impacting ongoing operations.

## Summary

On-premise deployment is a crucial capability for organizations needing stringent control over their data and models due to security, compliance, or performance reasons. By hosting models within their own infrastructure, organizations can better meet these needs while maintaining flexibility in deployment methods through tools like Flask and Docker. This pattern can also be effectively combined with other patterns such as Model Governance and Monitoring and Logging to ensure robust, compliant, and efficient operations.
