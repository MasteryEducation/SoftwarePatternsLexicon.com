## Introduction

The **Custom Metrics Logging** design pattern provides a framework for logging domain-specific metrics, allowing for a more granular understanding of machine learning model performance. This pattern is especially useful for deployment monitoring and logging, as it enables the recording of metrics that are closely aligned with business goals or specific model requirements, thus delivering actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

In real-world applications, standard performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score may not sufficiently capture all relevant aspects of model performance. There might be specific requirements or business objectives that necessitate the tracking of custom metrics. These custom metrics can offer insights into how well the model is performing in certain scenarios, detect biases, monitor user interaction, or provide analytics for continuous improvement.

## Solution

Implement a custom metrics logging system to capture and log domain-specific performance metrics. This system should be integrated into the model deployment pipeline to ensure that these metrics are consistently monitored and collected.

### Steps for Implementation:

1. **Identify Domain-Specific Metrics**: Determine which metrics are most relevant to your application and how they will provide additional insights into the model’s performance.
  
2. **Integrate Metrics Collection in the Codebase**: Modify your codebase to calculate and log the desired metrics.

3. **Logging Infrastructure**: Use a logging framework or service to store and visualize these metrics.

4. **Monitor and Analyze**: Regularly monitor these custom metrics to glean insights and take actions based on the analysis.

## Examples

### Example in Python with TensorFlow

In this example, we demonstrate how to log a custom metric using TensorFlow and a logging framework like TensorBoard.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class RootMeanSquaredError(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
    def __init__(self, name='rmse', **kwargs):
        super(RootMeanSquaredError, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
        self.squared_sum = self.add_weight(name='squared_sum', initializer='zeros')
        self.total_count = self.add_weight(name='total_count', initializer='zeros')
    
    def update_state(self, y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None):
        error = tf.square(y_pred - y_true)
        self.squared_sum.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(error))
        self.total_count.assign_add(tf.cast(tf.size(y_true), tf.float32))
    
    def result(self):
        mean_error = self.squared_sum / self.total_count
        return tf.sqrt(mean_error)
    
    def reset_states(self):
        self.squared_sum.assign(0.0)
        self.total_count.assign(0.0)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='mean_squared_error', 
              metrics=[RootMeanSquaredError()])

import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

log_dir = "/logs/metrics"
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir)
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

### Example in Python with Scikit-Learn

We demonstrate how to calculate and log a custom metric using Scikit-Learn and Python’s logging module.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
import numpy as np
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='model_performance.log', level=logging.INFO)

y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])
y_pred = np.array([0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2])

def log_custom_metric(y_true, y_pred):
    ll = log_loss(y_true, y_pred)
    logging.info(f"Log Loss: {ll}")

log_custom_metric(y_true, y_pred)
```

## Related Design Patterns

* **Model Versioning**: Keeping track of model versions and related metrics to compare model performances over time.
* **A/B Testing for Models**: Running controlled experiments to compare the performance of different models using custom metrics.
* **Drift Detection**: Monitoring shifts in input data or model performance using custom metrics.
* **Real-time Model Monitoring**: Implementing real-time monitoring systems to capture and act upon custom metrics promptly.

## Summary

Custom Metrics Logging is a powerful design pattern for gaining in-depth insights into machine learning model performance. By identifying, implementing, logging, and analyzing domain-specific metrics, practitioners can better align model monitoring with business objectives and technical requirements. This pattern ensures that valuable performance metrics are not overlooked and facilitates the continuous improvement and maintenance of deployed models.
