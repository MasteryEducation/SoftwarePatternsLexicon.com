Zero downtime deployment is a highly desirable characteristic in modern software engineering, particularly for machine learning applications where uninterrupted service is crucial. This design pattern ensures that updates, bug fixes, and new features can be rolled out to end-users without any noticeable service interruptions. 

## Key Concepts

Zero downtime deployment can be achieved through several techniques and strategies, including but not limited to Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Deployment, and Rolling Updates.

- **Blue-Green Deployment:** This involves creating two identical production environments (blue and green). The blue environment runs the current version, whereas the green environment runs the new version. Traffic is switched from blue to green to deploy the update.
  
- **Canary Deployment:** This strategy involves releasing the new update to a small subset of users before a full-scale rollout. This enables monitoring and gathering feedback to ensure the update is stable before wider distribution.
  
- **Rolling Updates:** This deployment strategy updates instances of the application incrementally, without downtime, progressively replacing old instances with new ones.

## Implementation Examples

### Blue-Green Deployment with Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app-blue
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app-blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app-container
        image: app:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9376
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app-green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app-container
        image: app:v2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9376
```

The Blue-Green deployment involves setting up separate deployments with identical configurations running different versions of an application. Load balancing can shift traffic between these deployments seamlessly.

### Canary Deployment with Python and Flask

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/feature', methods=['GET'])
def feature():
    user_id = request.args.get('user_id')
    if is_canary_user(user_id):
        return version_two_response()
    return version_one_response()

def is_canary_user(user_id):
    canary_user_ids = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    return int(user_id) in canary_user_ids

def version_one_response():
    return jsonify({"message": "Version 1"}), 200

def version_two_response():
    return jsonify({"message": "Version 2"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This example demonstrates a simple Canary deployment approach, where a subset of users receives responses from the new version of a feature, based on user IDs.

### Rolling Updates with AWS Elastic Beanstalk

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application-name MyApplicationName --version-label v2 --source-bundle S3Bucket=my-app-bucket,S3Key=my-app-v2.zip

aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name my-env --version-label v2
```

This commands sequence ensures that the new version is deployed gradually, maintaining application availability throughout the process.

## Related Design Patterns

- **Shadow Deployment:** Deploying the new version alongside the existing version without user traffic, to analyze its performance and behavior.
- **Feature Toggle:** Launching features such that they can be enabled or disabled easily, offering flexibility in deploying without downtime.

## Summary

Zero downtime deployment is essential for delivering continuous updates to machine learning applications without interrupting service. By using deployment strategies such as Blue-Green, Canary, and Rolling Updates, developers can ensure that their applications remain available and responsive during updates. Adopting these patterns not only enhances the user experience but also provides a safer and more controlled environment for deploying new changes.
