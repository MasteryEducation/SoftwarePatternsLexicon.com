Immutable Deployment in machine learning ensures each deployment is immutable and versioned, which promotes consistency and reproducibility. This pattern plays a crucial role in maintaining robust, reliable, and traceable deployments of machine learning models.

## Key Concepts

Immutable Deployment establishes that once a model version is deployed, it should not be modified. Each deployment is assigned a unique version, ensuring consistency and enabling easy rollback if required.

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all environments are running identical code and model versions.
- **Reproducibility**: Enables clear tracking of changes and quick rollback to previous versions if needed.
- **Stability**: Reduces risks associated with configuration drifts and unexpected changes.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Model Versioning**: Use a version control system to manage and track changes in your models.
2. **Containerization**: Deploy models in containers to encapsulate dependencies and environment configurations.
3. **Automation Pipelines**: Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the deployment process.
4. **Artifact Management**: Store versioned artifacts in a repository for traceability.

## Example Implementations

### Python (Using Docker and Git)

1. **Model Versioning & Storage**: 

```python
import joblib

model = ...  # Assume a trained model here
version = "1.0.0"
joblib.dump(model, f"model_{version}.pkl")

!git add model_{version}.pkl
!git commit -m "Add model version 1.0.0"
!git push origin main
```

2. **Containerization with Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY model_1.0.0.pkl /app/model.pkl
COPY serve_model.py /app/serve_model.py

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/serve_model.py"]
```

3. **Deployment Automation using GitHub Actions**:

```yaml
name: Deploy Model

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t mymodel:1.0.0 .

    - name: Publish Docker image
      run: docker tag mymodel:1.0.0 myrepo/mymodel:1.0.0
           docker push myrepo/mymodel:1.0.0

    - name: Deploy
      run: ... # specific deploy commands (k8s, ECS, etc.)
```

### TensorFlow Serving with Kubernetes

1. **Versioning and Storage**:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.Sequential([...])
model.save("/models/model/1")  # Version 1 of the model
```

2. **Kubernetes Deployment**:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: model-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: model
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: model
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tensorflow-serving
        image: tensorflow/serving:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8501
        volumeMounts:
        - name: model-volume
          mountPath: /models/model
      volumes:
      - name: model-volume
        nfs:
          server: <nfs-server>
          path: /models/model
```

## Related Design Patterns

### **Blue-Green Deployment**
Blue-Green Deployment reduces downtime and risk by running two identical environments. During a deployment, changes are made to the inactive environment, and after verification, traffic is switched to it.

### **Shadow Deployment**
Shadow Deployment runs the new model in parallel with the old one without exposing it to end users. This pattern helps evaluate the new model in production conditions without affecting the existing system.

### **Canary Deployment**
In Canary Deployment, a new version is slowly rolled out to a small subset of users before being fully deployed to all users. This pattern helps to test the new version's performance and robustness.

## Summary

Immutable Deployment ensures consistent, reliable, and repeatable deployments by making each deployment immutable and versioned. This pattern supports robust machine learning models in production by promoting traceability and stability. Implementing Immutable Deployment involves versioning models, containerizing them, and utilizing automation pipelines, which together foster a seamless and efficient deployment process.
