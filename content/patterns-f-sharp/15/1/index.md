## 15.1 Authentication and Authorization Patterns

In today's digital landscape, securing applications is paramount. Authentication and authorization are two critical components in this process, ensuring that only legitimate users gain access to resources and that they have the appropriate permissions. In this section, we'll explore these concepts in depth, focusing on how they can be effectively implemented in F# applications.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?" Common methods include passwords, tokens, and biometric data.

**Authorization**, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What can you do?" This involves setting permissions and access levels.

Both authentication and authorization are crucial for securing applications, as they prevent unauthorized access and ensure that users can only perform actions they're permitted to.

### Common Authentication Patterns

#### Password-Based Authentication

Password-based authentication is the most traditional method, where users provide a username and password to gain access. While simple, it requires careful handling to ensure security.

**Implementation in F#:**

```fsharp
open System.Security.Cryptography
open System.Text

let hashPassword (password: string) =
    use sha256 = SHA256.Create()
    let bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password)
    let hash = sha256.ComputeHash(bytes)
    Convert.ToBase64String(hash)

// Example usage
let password = "SecurePassword123"
let hashedPassword = hashPassword password
printfn "Hashed Password: %s" hashedPassword
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always hash and salt passwords before storing them.
- Use a strong hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or bcrypt.
- Enforce strong password policies.

#### Token-Based Authentication

Token-based authentication, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), is popular for stateless authentication. Tokens are issued upon successful authentication and are used for subsequent requests.

**Implementation in F#:**

```fsharp
open System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
open System.Security.Claims
open Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens

let generateJwtToken (username: string) =
    let securityKey = SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"))
    let credentials = SigningCredentials(securityKey, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256)
    let claims = [ Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, username) ]
    let token = JwtSecurityToken(
        issuer = "YourIssuer",
        audience = "YourAudience",
        claims = claims,
        expires = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30.0),
        signingCredentials = credentials)
    JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token)

// Example usage
let token = generateJwtToken "user@example.com"
printfn "JWT Token: %s" token
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use secure secret keys and algorithms.
- Set token expiration times.
- Implement token revocation strategies.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA enhances security by requiring two or more credentials. This could include something the user knows (password), something they have (a phone), or something they are (biometric data).

**Implementation in F#:**

While implementing MFA involves integrating with external services, here's a conceptual approach:

1. **Password Verification:** Verify the user's password as the first factor.
2. **OTP Generation:** Send a One-Time Password (OTP) to the user's registered device.
3. **OTP Verification:** Validate the OTP entered by the user.

**Best Practices:**
- Use time-based OTPs (TOTP) for added security.
- Encourage users to enable MFA for sensitive operations.

#### Biometric Authentication

Biometric authentication uses unique biological traits, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to verify identity. This method is highly secure but requires specialized hardware.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Integrate with platform-specific APIs for biometric data.
- Ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations.

### Authorization Patterns

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC assigns permissions to roles rather than individuals. Users are then assigned roles, simplifying permission management.

**Implementation in F#:**

```fsharp
type Role = Admin | User | Guest

let authorize (role: Role) (action: string) =
    match role with
    | Admin -> true
    | User -> action <> "Delete"
    | Guest -> action = "Read"

// Example usage
let canDelete = authorize Admin "Delete"
printfn "Can Admin Delete? %b" canDelete
```

**Best Practices:**
- Define roles and permissions clearly.
- Regularly review and update role assignments.

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC uses attributes (user, resource, environment) to determine access. This allows for fine-grained control.

**Implementation in F#:**

```fsharp
type Attribute = { Name: string; Value: string }

let authorizeWithAttributes (attributes: Attribute list) (action: string) =
    attributes |> List.exists (fun attr -> attr.Name = "Role" && attr.Value = "Admin") || action = "Read"

// Example usage
let attributes = [ { Name = "Role"; Value = "User" } ]
let canRead = authorizeWithAttributes attributes "Read"
printfn "Can User Read? %b" canRead
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use attributes to capture context and conditions.
- Implement policies that are easy to understand and maintain.

### Implementing Authentication and Authorization in F#

To implement these patterns in F#, we can leverage frameworks like ASP.NET Core, which provides robust support for authentication and authorization.

#### Setting Up Authentication

1. **Configure Services:**

```fsharp
open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
open Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

let configureServices (services: IServiceCollection) =
    services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddJwtBearer(fun options ->
            options.TokenValidationParameters <- TokenValidationParameters(
                ValidateIssuer = true,
                ValidateAudience = true,
                ValidateLifetime = true,
                ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
                ValidIssuer = "YourIssuer",
                ValidAudience = "YourAudience",
                IssuerSigningKey = SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"))
            )
        ) |> ignore
```

2. **Secure Endpoints:**

```fsharp
open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization

let configure (app: IApplicationBuilder) =
    app.UseAuthentication()
    app.UseAuthorization()
    app.UseEndpoints(fun endpoints ->
        endpoints.MapGet("/secure", (fun context ->
            if context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated then
                context.Response.WriteAsync("Welcome, authenticated user!")
            else
                context.Response.StatusCode <- 401
                context.Response.WriteAsync("Unauthorized")
        )) |> ignore
    )
```

#### Security Best Practices

- **Hash and Salt Passwords:** Never store plain-text passwords. Use strong hashing algorithms and add salt to prevent rainbow table attacks.
- **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all communications are encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and keep dependencies up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Handling Sessions and Tokens

Managing user sessions and tokens securely is crucial for maintaining application security.

#### Token Expiration and Refresh

Tokens should have a limited lifespan to reduce the risk of misuse. Implement refresh tokens to allow users to obtain new tokens without re-authenticating.

**Implementation in F#:**

```fsharp
let generateRefreshToken () =
    Guid.NewGuid().ToString()

let refreshToken (oldToken: string) =
    // Validate the old token and issue a new one
    if isValidToken oldToken then
        generateJwtToken "user@example.com"
    else
        failwith "Invalid token"
```

#### Token Revocation

Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens when necessary, such as when a user logs out or a security breach is detected.

### Third-Party Authentication

Using third-party authentication providers like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect can simplify the authentication process and enhance security.

#### OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

OAuth2 is a protocol for authorization, while OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of OAuth2 for authentication.

**Implementation in F#:**

1. **Register the Application:** Register your application with the provider (e.g., Google, Facebook) to obtain client credentials.

2. **Configure Authentication:**

```fsharp
services.AddAuthentication(fun options ->
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme <- CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme <- "Google"
)
.AddCookie()
.AddGoogle(fun options ->
    options.ClientId <- "YourClientId"
    options.ClientSecret <- "YourClientSecret"
) |> ignore
```

3. **Handle Callbacks:** Implement callback endpoints to handle the authentication response from the provider.

### Real-World Examples

Consider a scenario where a company implemented MFA and token-based authentication in their F# application. This prevented unauthorized access even when user credentials were compromised, as the attacker could not bypass the second authentication factor.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Hardcoding Credentials:** Never hardcode credentials in your codebase. Use environment variables or secure vaults.
- **Improper Token Storage:** Store tokens securely, preferably in HTTP-only cookies, to prevent XSS attacks.
