## 13.7 Functional-First Databases

In the evolving landscape of software development, the integration of functional programming principles with database management is gaining traction. Functional-first databases, such as EventStore, Datomic, and Cassandra, offer unique advantages by aligning with the immutability and statelessness inherent in functional programming. This section delves into the world of functional-first databases, focusing on their integration with F# applications, and explores the benefits and best practices associated with their use.

### Introduction to Functional-First Databases

Functional-first databases are designed to complement the principles of functional programming, emphasizing immutability, event sourcing, and statelessness. Unlike traditional relational databases, which often rely on mutable state and imperative transactions, functional-first databases capture changes as a series of immutable events or facts. This approach aligns with the functional programming paradigm, where data transformations are pure and side-effect-free.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Immutability**: Data is stored as immutable facts or events, ensuring that historical data remains unchanged.
- **Event Sourcing**: Changes are captured as a sequence of events, allowing for a complete audit trail and easy state reconstruction.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, often distributed across multiple nodes.
- **Consistency Models**: Support for eventual consistency and strong consistency, depending on the use case.

### Event Sourcing with EventStore

EventStore is a prominent example of a functional-first database that implements the event sourcing pattern. In event sourcing, every change to the application state is captured as an event, and the current state is derived by replaying these events.

#### How EventStore Works

- **Event Streams**: Each entity or aggregate in the system has its own stream of events. These streams are append-only, ensuring immutability.
- **Projections**: Events can be projected into views or read models to represent the current state of the system.
- **Subscriptions**: Applications can subscribe to event streams to react to changes in real-time.

### Integration with F#

Integrating EventStore with F# involves setting up a connection, defining event types, and implementing logic to write and read events. Let's explore these steps in detail.

#### Connecting to EventStore

To connect to EventStore from an F# application, we can use the EventStore.Client library. Here's a basic setup:

```fsharp
open EventStore.Client

let connectionString = "esdb://localhost:2113?tls=false"
let settings = EventStoreClientSettings.Create(connectionString)
let client = new EventStoreClient(settings)

// Ensure the connection is established
client.ConnectAsync() |> Async.AwaitTask |> Async.RunSynchronously
```

In this example, we establish a connection to a local EventStore instance. The connection string specifies the address and port, and we disable TLS for simplicity.

#### Modeling Events

In F#, we can define events using discriminated unions, which provide a type-safe way to represent different kinds of events.

```fsharp
type OrderEvent =
    | OrderCreated of orderId: string * customerId: string * amount: decimal
    | OrderShipped of orderId: string * shippingDate: DateTime
    | OrderCancelled of orderId: string * reason: string
```

Each case in the discriminated union represents a different event type, capturing the necessary data for that event.

#### Writing and Reading Events

To append events to a stream, we serialize the event data and write it to EventStore. Here's how we can do this:

```fsharp
open System.Text.Json

let appendEvent (client: EventStoreClient) streamName event =
    let eventData = JsonSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes(event)
    let eventData = EventData(Uuid.NewUuid(), event.GetType().Name, eventData)
    client.AppendToStreamAsync(streamName, StreamState.Any, [| eventData |])
    |> Async.AwaitTask
    |> Async.RunSynchronously

// Example usage
let orderCreated = OrderCreated("order-123", "customer-456", 99.99M)
appendEvent client "order-stream" orderCreated
```

Reading events involves subscribing to a stream and processing each event as it arrives:

```fsharp
let readEvents (client: EventStoreClient) streamName =
    let rec loop position =
        async {
            let! events = client.ReadStreamAsync(Direction.Forwards, streamName, position)
            for event in events do
                // Deserialize and process the event
                let eventData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<OrderEvent>(event.Event.Data.Span)
                printfn "Received event: %A" eventData
            return! loop (position + events.Length)
        }
    loop StreamPosition.Start |> Async.RunSynchronously

// Start reading events
readEvents client "order-stream"
```

#### Projecting Events into Current State

Projecting events involves transforming the sequence of events into a meaningful representation of the current state. This is often done using a fold function that applies each event to an initial state.

```fsharp
type OrderState =
    | NotCreated
    | Created of orderId: string * customerId: string * amount: decimal
    | Shipped of orderId: string * shippingDate: DateTime
    | Cancelled of orderId: string * reason: string

let applyEvent state event =
    match state, event with
    | NotCreated, OrderCreated(orderId, customerId, amount) -> Created(orderId, customerId, amount)
    | Created(orderId, _, _), OrderShipped(_, shippingDate) -> Shipped(orderId, shippingDate)
    | Created(orderId, _, _), OrderCancelled(_, reason) -> Cancelled(orderId, reason)
    | _ -> state

let projectEvents events =
    events |> Seq.fold applyEvent NotCreated

// Example usage
let events = [ OrderCreated("order-123", "customer-456", 99.99M); OrderShipped("order-123", DateTime.Now) ]
let currentState = projectEvents events
printfn "Current state: %A" currentState
```

### Immutability Benefits

Immutability is a cornerstone of functional programming, and it extends naturally to databases through event sourcing. By storing events as immutable facts, we gain several advantages:

- **Auditability**: Every change is recorded, providing a complete history of the system's state.
- **Reproducibility**: The current state can be reconstructed at any point in time by replaying events.
- **Scalability**: Immutable data can be distributed across nodes without the risk of conflicts.

### Other Functional Databases

While EventStore is a popular choice for event sourcing, other databases also align with functional paradigms:

- **Datomic**: A distributed database that emphasizes immutability and time-based queries. It stores data as facts and supports complex queries using Datalog.
- **Cassandra**: A NoSQL database that supports eventual consistency and is often used in conjunction with event sourcing to store events and projections.

### Consistency and Transactions

Functional-first databases often prioritize eventual consistency, where updates propagate asynchronously. However, they also provide mechanisms for ensuring transactional integrity when needed.

#### Handling Consistency

- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Use version numbers or timestamps to detect conflicts and retry operations.
- **Compensating Transactions**: Implement logic to undo changes if a series of operations fails.

### Best Practices

When working with functional-first databases, consider the following best practices:

- **Event Versioning**: As your application evolves, events may change. Use versioning to manage schema changes and ensure backward compatibility.
- **Schema Evolution**: Plan for changes in event structure by using techniques like upcasting to transform old events into the new format.
- **Data Retention**: Implement policies for archiving or purging old events to manage storage costs.

### Use Cases

Functional-first databases are particularly advantageous in scenarios where:

- **Auditability** is crucial, such as financial systems or compliance-driven applications.
- **Scalability** is required, with the need to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Complex Event Processing** is needed, allowing systems to react to changes in real-time.

### Conclusion

Integrating functional-first databases with F# offers a powerful combination of immutability, scalability, and real-time processing. By leveraging event sourcing and other functional paradigms, developers can build robust, maintainable applications that align with the principles of functional programming. As you explore these databases, remember to embrace the journey, experiment with different patterns, and continue to deepen your understanding of functional programming and database integration.
