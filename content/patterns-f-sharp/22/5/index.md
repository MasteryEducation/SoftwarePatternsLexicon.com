## 22.5 Web Development with F# and ASP.NET Core

In this section, we delve into the practical aspects of building web applications using F# and ASP.NET Core. This powerful combination allows developers to leverage the functional programming capabilities of F# alongside the robust, cross-platform features of ASP.NET Core. Let's explore how to harness these tools to create scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications.

### Key Features of ASP.NET Core for F# Development

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. Here are some key features that make it suitable for F# development:

- **Cross-Platform Support**: ASP.NET Core runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing F# developers to build applications that can be deployed across different environments.
- **Modular Architecture**: Its modular design enables developers to include only the necessary components, reducing the application's footprint and improving performance.
- **Middleware Pipeline**: ASP.NET Core's middleware pipeline allows developers to handle requests and responses efficiently, providing a flexible way to implement custom logic.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in support for dependency injection promotes loose coupling and enhances testability.
- **Razor Pages and MVC**: These features facilitate the development of dynamic web pages and RESTful services.

### Structuring a Web Application in F#

Structuring a web application in F# involves setting up the project, organizing code, and defining clear boundaries between different components. Let's walk through the process:

#### Project Setup and Organization

1. **Create a New ASP.NET Core Project**: Use the .NET CLI to create a new F# project:
   ```bash
   dotnet new web -lang F# -o MyFSharpWebApp
   cd MyFSharpWebApp
   ```

2. **Organize the Project Structure**: A typical project structure includes folders for Models, Views, Controllers, and Services. Here's a suggested layout:
   ```
   MyFSharpWebApp/
   ├── Controllers/
   ├── Models/
   ├── Views/
   ├── Services/
   ├── Program.fs
   ├── Startup.fs
   └── MyFSharpWebApp.fsproj
   ```

3. **Configure the Application**: In `Startup.fs`, configure services and middleware:
   ```fsharp
   open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder
   open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting
   open Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

   type Startup() =
       member _.ConfigureServices(services: IServiceCollection) =
           services.AddControllersWithViews() |> ignore

       member _.Configure(app: IApplicationBuilder, env: IWebHostEnvironment) =
           if env.IsDevelopment() then
               app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage() |> ignore
           app.UseRouting()
              .UseEndpoints(fun endpoints ->
                  endpoints.MapControllers() |> ignore
              ) |> ignore
   ```

### Design Patterns in Web Development

Design patterns provide a structured approach to solving common problems in software design. In web development with F#, patterns like MVC and MVU are particularly useful.

#### MVC (Model-View-Controller)

The MVC pattern separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps manage complexity and facilitates testing.

- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays data to the user and sends user commands to the Controller.
- **Controller**: Handles user input, interacts with the Model, and selects a View to render.

#### MVU (Model-View-Update)

The MVU pattern is a functional approach to building user interfaces, popularized by Elm and adopted in F# with libraries like Elmish.

- **Model**: Represents the state of the application.
- **View**: A function that takes the Model and returns a representation of the UI.
- **Update**: A function that takes the current Model and a message, returning a new Model.

### Creating RESTful APIs

RESTful APIs are a common way to expose web services. Let's see how to create a simple API in F# using ASP.NET Core.

#### Handling HTTP Requests and Responses

1. **Define a Model**: Create a model to represent the data:
   ```fsharp
   namespace MyFSharpWebApp.Models

   type Product = {
       Id: int
       Name: string
       Price: decimal
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Controller**: Implement a controller to handle HTTP requests:
   ```fsharp
   namespace MyFSharpWebApp.Controllers

   open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc
   open MyFSharpWebApp.Models

   [<ApiController>]
   [<Route("api/[controller]")>]
   type ProductsController() =
       inherit ControllerBase()

       let products = [
           { Id = 1; Name = "Laptop"; Price = 999.99M }
           { Id = 2; Name = "Smartphone"; Price = 499.99M }
       ]

       [<HttpGet>]
       member _.Get() = products

       [<HttpGet("{id}")>]
       member _.Get(id: int) =
           products |> List.tryFind (fun p -> p.Id = id)
   ```

3. **Routing**: ASP.NET Core uses attribute routing to map HTTP requests to controller actions.

### Data Access with Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a popular ORM for .NET applications. It simplifies data access by allowing developers to work with a database using .NET objects.

#### Setting Up EF Core with F#

1. **Install EF Core Packages**: Add the necessary NuGet packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
   ```

2. **Define a DbContext**: Create a context class to manage entity objects:
   ```fsharp
   namespace MyFSharpWebApp.Data

   open Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
   open MyFSharpWebApp.Models

   type AppDbContext() =
       inherit DbContext()

       [<DefaultValue>]
       val mutable products: DbSet<Product>
       member this.Products with get() = this.products and set v = this.products <- v
   ```

3. **Configure the DbContext**: In `Startup.fs`, configure the DbContext:
   ```fsharp
   services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(fun options ->
       options.UseSqlServer("YourConnectionString") |> ignore
   ) |> ignore
   ```

### Authentication and Authorization

Implementing authentication and authorization is crucial for securing web applications.

#### Implementing Authentication

1. **Add Identity Services**: Configure identity services in `Startup.fs`:
   ```fsharp
   services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>()
           .AddEntityFrameworkStores<AppDbContext>()
           .AddDefaultTokenProviders() |> ignore
   ```

2. **Configure Authentication Middleware**: Use authentication middleware in the request pipeline:
   ```fsharp
   app.UseAuthentication()
      .UseAuthorization() |> ignore
   ```

#### Implementing Authorization

1. **Define Policies**: Create authorization policies:
   ```fsharp
   services.AddAuthorization(fun options ->
       options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policyBuilder ->
           policyBuilder.RequireRole("Admin") |> ignore
       ) |> ignore
   ) |> ignore
   ```

2. **Apply Policies**: Use policies in controllers:
   ```fsharp
   [<Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")>]
   member _.AdminAction() = "Admin content"
   ```

### Testing Web Applications

Testing is an integral part of web development. Let's explore techniques for unit testing and integration testing in F#.

#### Unit Testing

1. **Set Up a Test Project**: Create a new test project using the .NET CLI:
   ```bash
   dotnet new xunit -lang F# -o MyFSharpWebApp.Tests
   ```

2. **Write Unit Tests**: Use xUnit to write unit tests for your application:
   ```fsharp
   open Xunit
   open MyFSharpWebApp.Controllers

   module ProductsControllerTests =

       [<Fact>]
       let ``Get should return all products`` () =
           let controller = ProductsController()
           let result = controller.Get()
           Assert.Equal(2, List.length result)
   ```

#### Integration Testing

1. **Set Up an Integration Test Project**: Use the .NET CLI to create an integration test project:
   ```bash
   dotnet new xunit -lang F# -o MyFSharpWebApp.IntegrationTests
   ```

2. **Write Integration Tests**: Test the application as a whole:
   ```fsharp
   open Xunit
   open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing
   open System.Net.Http

   module IntegrationTests =

       [<Fact>]
       let ``GET /api/products should return OK`` () =
           use appFactory = new WebApplicationFactory<Startup>()
           use client = appFactory.CreateClient()

           let response = client.GetAsync("/api/products").Result
           Assert.Equal(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode)
   ```

### Deployment Strategies

Deploying F# web applications can be done using various strategies. Let's discuss hosting on Azure and Docker.

#### Hosting on Azure

1. **Create an Azure App Service**: Use the Azure portal to create an App Service for your application.

2. **Deploy the Application**: Use the Azure CLI to deploy your application:
   ```bash
   az webapp up --name MyFSharpWebApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup
   ```

3. **Configure the App Service**: Set environment variables and configure scaling options in the Azure portal.

#### Hosting with Docker

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Define a Dockerfile for your application:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
   WORKDIR /app
   EXPOSE 80

   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
   WORKDIR /src
   COPY . .
   RUN dotnet restore "MyFSharpWebApp.fsproj"
   RUN dotnet build "MyFSharpWebApp.fsproj" -c Release -o /app/build

   FROM build AS publish
   RUN dotnet publish "MyFSharpWebApp.fsproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

   FROM base AS final
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
   ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyFSharpWebApp.dll"]
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Docker Image**: Use Docker CLI to build and run your application:
   ```bash
   docker build -t myfsharpwebapp .
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 myfsharpwebapp
   ```
