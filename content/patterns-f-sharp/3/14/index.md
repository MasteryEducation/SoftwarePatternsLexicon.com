## 3.14 Records and Discriminated Unions

In the world of F#, records and discriminated unions stand as foundational pillars for data modeling. These constructs not only enhance the expressiveness and readability of your code but also align closely with functional programming paradigms, making them indispensable tools for expert software engineers and architects. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of records and discriminated unions, exploring their syntax, usage, and the powerful patterns they enable.

### Importance of Records and Discriminated Unions

Records and discriminated unions are essential for modeling complex data structures in a declarative manner. They allow developers to define data types that are both expressive and concise, facilitating the creation of robust and maintainable systems. By leveraging these constructs, you can represent domain concepts more naturally and ensure your codebase remains adaptable to changing requirements.

### Records in F#

Records in F# are immutable by default, providing a straightforward way to define data structures with named fields. They are akin to tuples but with named fields, which enhances code readability and maintainability.

#### Defining Records

To define a record in F#, you use the `type` keyword followed by the record name and its fields enclosed in curly braces.

```fsharp
type Person = {
    FirstName: string
    LastName: string
    Age: int
}
```

This simple definition creates a `Person` type with three fields: `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age`.

#### Creating and Using Records

Creating an instance of a record is straightforward:

```fsharp
let johnDoe = { FirstName = "John"; LastName = "Doe"; Age = 30 }
```

Accessing fields is equally intuitive:

```fsharp
let fullName = johnDoe.FirstName + " " + johnDoe.LastName
```

#### Immutability and Copy-and-Update Expressions

Records are immutable by default, meaning once a record is created, its fields cannot be changed. However, you can create modified copies using the copy-and-update syntax.

```fsharp
let olderJohn = { johnDoe with Age = johnDoe.Age + 1 }
```

This expression creates a new `Person` record with the same `FirstName` and `LastName` but an incremented `Age`.

#### Mutable Records

While immutability is a key feature of functional programming, there are cases where mutable records are necessary. You can define mutable fields using the `mutable` keyword.

```fsharp
type MutablePerson = {
    mutable Age: int
}

let mutablePerson = { Age = 30 }
mutablePerson.Age <- 31
```

Use mutable records judiciously, as they can introduce side effects that complicate reasoning about your code.

### Discriminated Unions

Discriminated unions (DUs) are a powerful feature in F# for representing data that can take on multiple forms. They are ideal for modeling scenarios where a value can be one of several distinct cases.

#### Defining Discriminated Unions

A discriminated union is defined using the `type` keyword, followed by the union name and its cases.

```fsharp
type Shape =
    | Circle of radius: float
    | Rectangle of width: float * height: float
    | Triangle of base: float * height: float
```

This `Shape` type can represent a circle, rectangle, or triangle, each with its associated data.

#### Pattern Matching with Discriminated Unions

Pattern matching is a powerful feature that allows you to deconstruct and work with discriminated unions.

```fsharp
let describeShape shape =
    match shape with
    | Circle radius -> sprintf "Circle with radius %f" radius
    | Rectangle (width, height) -> sprintf "Rectangle with width %f and height %f" width height
    | Triangle (base, height) -> sprintf "Triangle with base %f and height %f" base height
```

This function uses pattern matching to describe a `Shape` based on its case.

#### Nested Patterns and Active Patterns

F# supports nested patterns and active patterns, which enable more complex matching scenarios.

```fsharp
let (|Even|Odd|) input =
    if input % 2 = 0 then Even else Odd

let describeNumber number =
    match number with
    | Even -> "Even number"
    | Odd -> "Odd number"
```

Active patterns allow you to define custom matching logic, enhancing the flexibility of pattern matching.

#### Single-Case Discriminated Unions

Single-case discriminated unions are a technique for adding type safety to your code. They wrap a single value in a union, providing a distinct type.

```fsharp
type EmailAddress = EmailAddress of string

let sendEmail (EmailAddress email) =
    printfn "Sending email to %s" email
```

This approach ensures that only valid email addresses are passed to functions expecting an `EmailAddress` type.

### Real-World Scenarios

Records and discriminated unions simplify complex data representations in real-world applications. Consider a financial trading system where different types of trades need to be modeled. Discriminated unions can represent various trade types, while records can capture trade details.

```fsharp
type Trade =
    | Equity of symbol: string * quantity: int
    | Forex of currencyPair: string * amount: float
    | Derivative of contract: string * expiry: DateTime

type TradeDetails = {
    Trade: Trade
    Timestamp: DateTime
    Status: string
}
```

This model allows for clear and maintainable representations of trades and their associated details.

### Serialization Considerations

When working with records and discriminated unions, serialization is an important consideration, especially for data persistence and communication between systems. F# provides libraries like `FSharp.Json` for serializing these constructs.

```fsharp
open FSharp.Json

let serializedTrade = Json.serialize { Trade = Equity("AAPL", 100); Timestamp = DateTime.Now; Status = "Open" }
let deserializedTrade = Json.deserialize<TradeDetails> serializedTrade
```

Ensure that your types are compatible with the serialization library you choose, and handle versioning and compatibility carefully.

### Benefits of F#'s Syntax

F#'s syntax for records and discriminated unions promotes readability and expressiveness. By modeling data declaratively, you can create code that closely matches domain concepts, reducing the gap between the problem space and the solution space.

### Encouraging Best Practices

As you leverage records and discriminated unions in your F# projects, focus on writing clear, maintainable, and expressive code. Use these constructs to encapsulate domain logic, enforce type safety, and simplify complex data representations.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the examples provided and modify them to suit your needs. Try creating your own records and discriminated unions, and explore how pattern matching can simplify your code. Consider the following challenges:

- Create a record type for a book with fields for title, author, and publication year. Use a copy-and-update expression to create a new book with an updated publication year.
- Define a discriminated union for a payment method with cases for credit card, PayPal, and bank transfer. Implement a function that processes different payment methods using pattern matching.

### Visualizing Records and Discriminated Unions

To better understand the relationships and structures of records and discriminated unions, let's visualize them using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Record Structure

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Person {
        +string FirstName
        +string LastName
        +int Age
    }
```

This diagram represents the `Person` record with its fields.

#### Discriminated Union Structure

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        <<Union>>
        Circle
        Rectangle
        Triangle
    }
    class Circle {
        +float radius
    }
    class Rectangle {
        +float width
        +float height
    }
    class Triangle {
        +float base
        +float height
    }
    Shape --> Circle
    Shape --> Rectangle
    Shape --> Triangle
```

This diagram illustrates the `Shape` discriminated union and its cases.
