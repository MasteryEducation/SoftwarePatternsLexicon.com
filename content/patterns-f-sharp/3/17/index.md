## 3.17 Advanced Type System Features

In this section, we delve into the advanced type system features of F#, focusing on active patterns, units of measure, and computation expressions. These features allow developers to write expressive, type-safe, and maintainable code. By mastering these concepts, you can leverage the full power of F# to solve complex programming challenges effectively.

### Active Patterns

Active patterns are a powerful feature in F# that extend the capabilities of pattern matching. They allow you to define custom patterns that can be used to deconstruct and analyze data in a more flexible way. Let's explore the different types of active patterns and how they can be applied.

#### Basic Syntax and Usage

Active patterns are defined using the `let` keyword followed by a pattern name and a pattern definition. Here's a simple example:

```fsharp
let (|Even|Odd|) n =
    if n % 2 = 0 then Even else Odd

let describeNumber n =
    match n with
    | Even -> "The number is even."
    | Odd -> "The number is odd."

printfn "%s" (describeNumber 4)  // Output: The number is even.
printfn "%s" (describeNumber 5)  // Output: The number is odd.
```

In this example, the active pattern `(|Even|Odd|)` is used to classify numbers as either even or odd.

#### Partial Active Patterns

Partial active patterns allow you to match only a subset of possible inputs. They are useful when you want to handle specific cases and ignore others. Here's how you can define a partial active pattern:

```fsharp
let (|Int|_|) (input: string) =
    match System.Int32.TryParse(input) with
    | (true, value) -> Some value
    | _ -> None

let parseInput input =
    match input with
    | Int value -> sprintf "Parsed integer: %d" value
    | _ -> "Not an integer"

printfn "%s" (parseInput "123")  // Output: Parsed integer: 123
printfn "%s" (parseInput "abc")  // Output: Not an integer
```

The `Int` active pattern attempts to parse a string as an integer and returns `Some value` if successful, or `None` otherwise.

#### Parameterized Active Patterns

Parameterized active patterns take arguments, allowing for more dynamic pattern matching. Here's an example:

```fsharp
let (|DivisibleBy|_|) divisor n =
    if n % divisor = 0 then Some() else None

let checkDivisibility n =
    match n with
    | DivisibleBy 3 -> "Divisible by 3"
    | DivisibleBy 5 -> "Divisible by 5"
    | _ -> "Not divisible by 3 or 5"

printfn "%s" (checkDivisibility 9)  // Output: Divisible by 3
printfn "%s" (checkDivisibility 10) // Output: Divisible by 5
```

In this example, the `DivisibleBy` pattern checks if a number is divisible by a given divisor.

#### Multi-Case Active Patterns

Multi-case active patterns allow you to define multiple patterns within a single active pattern. This is useful for complex data extraction and decision-making logic. Here's an example:

```fsharp
type Shape =
    | Circle of float
    | Rectangle of float * float

let (|Circle|Rectangle|Unknown|) shape =
    match shape with
    | Circle radius -> Circle radius
    | Rectangle (width, height) -> Rectangle (width, height)
    | _ -> Unknown

let describeShape shape =
    match shape with
    | Circle radius -> sprintf "Circle with radius: %f" radius
    | Rectangle (width, height) -> sprintf "Rectangle with width: %f and height: %f" width height
    | Unknown -> "Unknown shape"

printfn "%s" (describeShape (Circle 5.0))  // Output: Circle with radius: 5.000000
printfn "%s" (describeShape (Rectangle (3.0, 4.0))) // Output: Rectangle with width: 3.000000 and height: 4.000000
```

The `(|Circle|Rectangle|Unknown|)` pattern matches different shapes and extracts relevant data.

### Units of Measure

Units of measure in F# provide a way to add compile-time safety to numeric calculations by associating units with numeric types. This feature helps prevent errors related to unit mismatches and improves code clarity.

#### Defining Units of Measure

To define a unit of measure, you use the `[<Measure>]` attribute. Here's a basic example:

```fsharp
[<Measure>] type m
[<Measure>] type s

let distance = 100.0<m>
let time = 9.58<s>
let speed = distance / time

printfn "Speed: %f m/s" speed  // Output: Speed: 10.438413 m/s
```

In this example, `m` and `s` are units of measure for meters and seconds, respectively.

#### Advanced Scenarios

Units of measure can be combined with generics to create flexible and safe numeric computations. Here's an example:

```fsharp
[<Measure>] type kg
[<Measure>] type m
[<Measure>] type s

let calculateForce (mass: float<kg>) (acceleration: float<m/s^2>) : float<kg m/s^2> =
    mass * acceleration

let mass = 70.0<kg>
let acceleration = 9.81<m/s^2>
let force = calculateForce mass acceleration

printfn "Force: %f N" force  // Output: Force: 686.700000 N
```

In this example, we define a function `calculateForce` that calculates force using mass and acceleration, ensuring type safety with units of measure.

#### Operator Overloading

F# allows you to overload operators to work with units of measure. Here's an example:

```fsharp
let (+) (x: float<m>) (y: float<m>) = x + y
let (-) (x: float<m>) (y: float<m>) = x - y

let length1 = 5.0<m>
let length2 = 3.0<m>
let totalLength = length1 + length2
let difference = length1 - length2

printfn "Total Length: %f m" totalLength  // Output: Total Length: 8.000000 m
printfn "Difference: %f m" difference     // Output: Difference: 2.000000 m
```

By overloading the `+` and `-` operators, we can perform arithmetic operations on values with units of measure.

### Computation Expressions

Computation expressions in F# provide a way to define custom workflows and handle side effects in a structured manner. They are a powerful tool for creating domain-specific languages (DSLs) and managing complex computations.

#### Customizing Behavior with Builder Methods

Computation expressions are defined using builder methods. Here's a simple example of a computation expression for handling option types:

```fsharp
type OptionBuilder() =
    member _.Bind(x, f) = Option.bind f x
    member _.Return(x) = Some x

let option = OptionBuilder()

let result =
    option {
        let! x = Some 5
        let! y = Some 10
        return x + y
    }

printfn "Result: %A" result  // Output: Result: Some 15
```

In this example, the `OptionBuilder` defines the `Bind` and `Return` methods to create a computation expression for option types.

#### Handling Side Effects

Computation expressions can also be used to handle side effects, such as asynchronous operations. Here's an example using the `async` computation expression:

```fsharp
let asyncComputation =
    async {
        let! data = async { return "Hello, world!" }
        printfn "%s" data
    }

Async.RunSynchronously asyncComputation  // Output: Hello, world!
```

The `async` computation expression allows you to perform asynchronous operations in a clear and concise manner.

#### Creating Domain-Specific Workflows

Computation expressions can be tailored to create domain-specific workflows. Here's an example of a computation expression for a simple state machine:

```fsharp
type StateBuilder() =
    member _.Bind(x, f) = f x
    member _.Return(x) = x

let state = StateBuilder()

let stateMachine initialState =
    state {
        let! state1 = initialState
        let! state2 = state1 + 1
        let! state3 = state2 * 2
        return state3
    }

let finalState = stateMachine 0
printfn "Final State: %d" finalState  // Output: Final State: 2
```

In this example, the `StateBuilder` defines a computation expression for a simple state machine that performs a series of state transformations.

### Combining Advanced Features

By combining active patterns, units of measure, and computation expressions, you can write highly expressive and type-safe code. Here's an example that demonstrates the integration of these features:

```fsharp
[<Measure>] type km
[<Measure>] type h

let (|Speed|_|) (distance: float<km>) (time: float<h>) =
    if time > 0.0<h> then Some(distance / time) else None

type SpeedBuilder() =
    member _.Bind(x, f) = Option.bind f x
    member _.Return(x) = Some x

let speed = SpeedBuilder()

let calculateSpeed distance time =
    speed {
        let! speed = Speed distance time
        return speed
    }

let result = calculateSpeed 100.0<km> 2.0<h>
printfn "Speed: %A km/h" result  // Output: Speed: Some 50.000000 km/h
```

In this example, we define a `Speed` active pattern to calculate speed from distance and time, and use a computation expression to handle the calculation.

### Best Practices

When using advanced type system features in F#, it's important to follow best practices to ensure code clarity and maintainability:

- **Use Active Patterns Judiciously**: Active patterns can simplify complex matching logic, but overuse can lead to increased cognitive load. Use them when they provide clear benefits.
- **Leverage Units of Measure for Safety**: Units of measure add compile-time safety to numeric calculations. Use them to prevent unit mismatch errors and improve code readability.
- **Design Computation Expressions Thoughtfully**: Computation expressions are powerful tools for creating custom workflows. Ensure they are well-designed and align with your domain's needs.
- **Balance Complexity and Readability**: Advanced features can introduce complexity. Strive for a balance between expressiveness and readability.
- **Experiment and Iterate**: Experiment with these features to solve problems in innovative ways. Iterate on your designs to find the best solutions.

### Potential Complexities

While advanced type system features offer significant benefits, they can also introduce complexities:

- **Cognitive Load**: Understanding and using advanced features requires a deep understanding of F#'s type system. Be mindful of the cognitive load they introduce.
- **Debugging Challenges**: Advanced type manipulations can make debugging more challenging. Use tools and techniques to simplify debugging.
- **Performance Considerations**: Some advanced features may have performance implications. Profile and optimize your code as needed.

### Encouragement to Experiment

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive applications. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
