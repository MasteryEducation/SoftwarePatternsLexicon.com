open System.Security.Cryptography
open System.Text

let encryptData (plainText: string) (key: string) =
    let aes = Aes.Create()
    aes.Key <- Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key)
    aes.IV <- Array.zeroCreate 16 // Initialization vector

    let encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV)
    use ms = new System.IO.MemoryStream()
    use cs = new CryptoStream(ms, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write)
    use sw = new System.IO.StreamWriter(cs)
    sw.Write(plainText)
    ms.ToArray()

let encryptedData = encryptData "Sensitive Data" "YourEncryptionKeyHere"
```

> **Explanation**: This code demonstrates how to encrypt sensitive data using AES encryption in F#. It highlights the importance of protecting user data through encryption.

#### Example 2: Algorithmic Bias Testing

```fsharp
let testAlgorithmForBias (algorithm: 'a -> 'b) (testData: ('a * 'b) list) =
    testData
    |> List.map (fun (input, expected) ->
        let result = algorithm input
        if result = expected then
            printfn "Test passed for input: %A" input
        else
            printfn "Test failed for input: %A. Expected: %A, Got: %A" input expected result)

let sampleData = [("input1", "expected1"); ("input2", "expected2")]
testAlgorithmForBias yourAlgorithm sampleData
```
