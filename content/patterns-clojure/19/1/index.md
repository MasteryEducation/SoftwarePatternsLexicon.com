## 19.1 Twelve-Factor App Principles in Clojure

The Twelve-Factor App methodology provides a set of best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and cloud-native applications. These principles are particularly relevant in the context of Clojure, a language known for its simplicity, immutability, and functional programming paradigms. In this section, we will explore how to apply each of the twelve factors using Clojure, leveraging its features and ecosystem to create robust applications.

### Codebase Management

A twelve-factor app is always tracked in a version control system like Git, with a single codebase that can be deployed in multiple environments.

- **Single Codebase:** Maintain a single codebase per application, tracked in version control, with multiple deploys (e.g., production, staging).
- **Logical Organization:** Use Clojure's namespace system to organize code logically, separating concerns into distinct modules.

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [myapp.db :as db]
            [myapp.web :as web]))

(defn start-app []
  (db/connect)
  (web/start-server))
```

### Dependencies Declaration

Explicitly declare all dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.

- **Dependency Management:** Use `deps.edn` or `project.clj` to declare dependencies, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.

```clojure
;; deps.edn
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        ring/ring-core {:mvn/version "1.9.0"}}}
```

- **Tools:** Utilize tools like Leiningen or Clojure CLI to manage dependencies effectively.

### Config Management

Store configuration in the environment, not in code, to separate config from code.

- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables or libraries like `environ` to manage configuration settings.

```clojure
;; Using environ
(require '[environ.core :refer [env]])

(def db-url (env :database-url))
```

- **Security:** Ensure secrets and credentials are not hard-coded or checked into version control.

### Backing Services as Attached Resources

Treat backing services as attached resources, accessed via configuration.

- **Configuration Access:** Use configuration to access databases, message queues, etc., allowing for easy swapping without code changes.

```clojure
(defn connect-to-db []
  (let [db-url (env :database-url)]
    (jdbc/get-connection db-url)))
```

### Build, Release, Run Separation

Separate the build, release, and run stages to streamline deployment.

- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines to automate these stages.

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Build Stage] --> B[Release Stage]
  B --> C[Run Stage]
```

### Stateless Processes

Design applications to be stateless, with any persistent data stored in backing services.

- **State Management:** Avoid storing session data on the server; use external stores like Redis if necessary.

```clojure
;; Example of using Redis for session storage
(require '[carmine :as redis])

(defn store-session [session-id data]
  (redis/wcar {} (redis/set session-id data)))
```

### Port Binding

Export services via port binding, allowing the app to be self-contained.

- **Embedded Servers:** Use embedded servers like Jetty or HTTP Kit to handle HTTP requests.

```clojure
(require '[org.httpkit.server :refer [run-server]])

(defn start-server []
  (run-server handler {:port (Integer. (env :port))}))
```

### Concurrency

Scale applications by running multiple instances rather than relying on threading.

- **Concurrency Handling:** Ensure the application can handle concurrent requests without shared mutable state.

```clojure
;; Example of using core.async for concurrency
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [go chan >! <!]])

(defn process-request [request]
  (go
    (let [response (<! (handle-request request))]
      (deliver-response response))))
```

### Disposability

Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.

- **Graceful Termination:** Handle signals for graceful termination and clean up resources during shutdown.

```clojure
(defn shutdown []
  (println "Shutting down...")
  ;; Clean up resources
  )

(.addShutdownHook (Runtime/getRuntime) (Thread. shutdown))
```

### Dev/Prod Parity

Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.

- **Environment Consistency:** Use Docker to standardize environments across all stages.

```dockerfile
FROM clojure:openjdk-11
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN lein uberjar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "target/myapp.jar"]
```

### Logs as Event Streams

Treat logs as event streams, outputting to STDOUT/STDERR for collection.

- **Log Management:** Avoid managing log files within the application; let the platform handle log aggregation.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.tools.logging :as log])

(log/info "Application started")
```

### Admin Processes

Run admin or management tasks as one-off processes using the same codebase.

- **REPL-Driven Development:** Use the REPL for tasks like database migrations or data fixes.

```clojure
;; Example of a one-off admin task
(defn migrate-db []
  (println "Running database migrations..."))
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- **Scalability:** Facilitates scaling applications across multiple environments.
- **Maintainability:** Promotes clean code organization and separation of concerns.
- **Flexibility:** Allows easy swapping of backing services and configuration changes.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity:** Requires careful management of environment variables and configuration.
- **Learning Curve:** May have a steep learning curve for developers new to cloud-native practices.

### Best Practices

- **Version Control:** Always use version control for codebase management.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for configuration to ensure flexibility and security.
- **CI/CD:** Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- **Docker:** Use Docker to ensure consistency across environments.

### Conclusion

The Twelve-Factor App methodology provides a robust framework for building cloud-native applications in Clojure. By adhering to these principles, developers can create scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications that are well-suited for modern cloud environments. Embracing these practices not only enhances the development process but also ensures that applications are resilient and adaptable to changing requirements.
