## 13.5. Authentication and Authorization with Friend and Buddy

In the realm of web development, ensuring that users are who they claim to be (authentication) and that they have the appropriate permissions to access resources (authorization) are critical components. In Clojure, libraries such as [Friend](https://github.com/cemerick/friend) and [Buddy](https://funcool.github.io/buddy-auth/latest/) provide robust solutions for implementing these security features. This section will guide you through the concepts, comparisons, and implementations of authentication and authorization using these libraries.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Common methods include:

- **Form-based Authentication**: Users provide credentials via a form.
- **Token-based Authentication**: Users receive a token after initial authentication, which is used for subsequent requests.
- **OAuth**: A protocol for token-based authentication and authorization, allowing third-party services to exchange information without exposing user credentials.

**Authorization**, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. This often involves:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users are assigned roles, and permissions are granted based on these roles.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access is granted based on attributes and policies.

### Comparing Friend and Buddy

Both Friend and Buddy are popular libraries in the Clojure ecosystem for handling authentication and authorization, but they have different strengths and use cases.

#### Friend

Friend is a comprehensive library that provides:

- **Pluggable Authentication**: Supports various authentication workflows, including form-based and OAuth.
- **Authorization**: Offers role-based access control.
- **Ease of Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with Ring, a Clojure web application library.

#### Buddy

Buddy is a more modern library that focuses on:

- **Token-Based Authentication**: Strong support for JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and session management.
- **Security Features**: Includes cryptographic functions and utilities for secure password storage.
- **Flexibility**: Provides a modular approach, allowing developers to pick and choose components as needed.

### Implementing Authentication with Friend

Let's start by implementing a simple form-based authentication using Friend.

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]
            [cemerick.friend :as friend]
            [cemerick.friend.credentials :as creds]
            [cemerick.friend.workflows :as workflows]))

;; Define a simple user database
(def users {"user1" {:username "user1"
                     :password (creds/hash-bcrypt "password")
                     :roles #{::user}}})

;; Define a simple handler
(defn handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Welcome to the secure area!"})

;; Wrap the handler with Friend's authentication middleware
(def app
  (-> handler
      (friend/authenticate {:credential-fn (partial creds/bcrypt-credential-fn users)
                            :workflows [(workflows/interactive-form)]})
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))

;; Start the server
(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app {:port 3000}))
```

In this example, we define a simple user database with bcrypt-hashed passwords and wrap our handler with Friend's authentication middleware. The `interactive-form` workflow handles form-based login.

### Implementing Authentication with Buddy

Now, let's implement token-based authentication using Buddy.

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]
            [buddy.auth :refer [authenticated?]]
            [buddy.auth.backends.token :refer [jws-backend]]
            [buddy.auth.middleware :refer [wrap-authentication]]
            [buddy.sign.jwt :as jwt]))

;; Define a secret key for signing tokens
(def secret "mysecretkey")

;; Define a simple handler
(defn handler [request]
  (if (authenticated? request)
    {:status 200
     :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
     :body "Welcome to the secure area!"}
    {:status 401
     :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
     :body "Unauthorized"}))

;; Define the authentication backend
(def backend (jws-backend {:secret secret}))

;; Wrap the handler with Buddy's authentication middleware
(def app
  (-> handler
      (wrap-authentication backend)
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))

;; Start the server
(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app {:port 3000}))
```

In this example, we use Buddy's `jws-backend` for token-based authentication. The `authenticated?` function checks if the request contains a valid token.

### Authorization Strategies

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Both Friend and Buddy support RBAC, allowing you to define roles and permissions.

**Friend Example:**

```clojure
(friend/authenticate {:credential-fn (partial creds/bcrypt-credential-fn users)
                      :workflows [(workflows/interactive-form)]
                      :authorization-fn (fn [identity]
                                          (contains? (:roles identity) ::admin))})
```

**Buddy Example:**

```clojure
(defn admin-handler [request]
  (if (some #{:admin} (:roles request))
    {:status 200 :body "Admin area"}
    {:status 403 :body "Forbidden"}))
```

### Best Practices for Securing Web Applications

1. **Use Strong Password Hashing**: Always hash passwords using strong algorithms like bcrypt.
2. **Implement HTTPS**: Ensure all data is transmitted securely using HTTPS.
3. **Validate Input**: Protect against injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user input.
4. **Use Secure Tokens**: For token-based authentication, use secure, signed tokens like JWT.
5. **Limit Session Lifetimes**: Implement session expiration and renewal strategies.
6. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep libraries and dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Session Management and Storing Credentials Securely

- **Session Management**: Use secure cookies and consider session storage mechanisms that prevent session hijacking.
- **Storing Credentials**: Never store plain-text passwords. Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive information.

### Visualizing Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    User->>Browser: Enter credentials
    Browser->>Server: Send credentials
    Server->>Server: Validate credentials
    alt Valid credentials
        Server->>Browser: Send session token
        Browser->>User: Access granted
    else Invalid credentials
        Server->>Browser: Send error message
        Browser->>User: Access denied
    end
```

This diagram illustrates the typical flow of form-based authentication, where the user submits credentials, the server validates them, and a session token is issued upon successful authentication.

### Try It Yourself
