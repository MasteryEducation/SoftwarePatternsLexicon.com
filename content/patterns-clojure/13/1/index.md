## 13.1. Overview of Web Frameworks in Clojure

Web development in Clojure offers a unique blend of functional programming paradigms and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the main web frameworks in Clojure, including Ring, Compojure, Luminus, Pedestal, and Reitit. We'll explore their core principles, compare their features, and provide guidance on selecting the right framework for your project.

### Introduction to Clojure Web Frameworks

Clojure's web development landscape is characterized by its flexibility, composability, and the ability to leverage the JVM ecosystem. The frameworks discussed here are designed to provide a robust foundation for building web applications and services, each with its unique strengths and community support.

### Key Web Frameworks in Clojure

#### Ring

**Ring** is the foundational library for web development in Clojure. It provides a simple and flexible abstraction for handling HTTP requests and responses. The core concept in Ring is the **middleware** pattern, which allows developers to compose web applications by stacking functions that process requests and responses.

- **Core Principles**: Ring is built around the idea of middleware, which are functions that wrap handlers to modify requests and responses. This composability allows for a clean separation of concerns and easy extension of functionality.
  
- **Features**: Ring provides a minimalistic approach, focusing on the HTTP protocol. It includes utilities for handling cookies, sessions, and file uploads.

- **Use Cases**: Ideal for developers who want a lightweight, customizable foundation for their web applications.

- **Community Adoption**: As the de facto standard for Clojure web applications, Ring is widely used and supported.

**Example Code**:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]))

(defn handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Hello, World!"})

(def app
  (wrap-defaults handler site-defaults))

(run-jetty app {:port 3000})
```

#### Compojure

**Compojure** is a routing library that builds on top of Ring. It provides a concise syntax for defining routes and handling HTTP requests.

- **Core Principles**: Compojure emphasizes simplicity and expressiveness in route definitions. It uses Clojure's destructuring capabilities to extract parameters from requests.

- **Features**: Compojure supports RESTful routing, route composition, and middleware integration.

- **Use Cases**: Suitable for applications where clear and concise routing is a priority.

- **Community Adoption**: Compojure is one of the most popular routing libraries in the Clojure ecosystem.

**Example Code**:

```clojure
(ns myapp.routes
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Welcome to Compojure!")
  (GET "/hello/:name" [name] (str "Hello, " name))
  (route/not-found "Page not found"))

(def app
  (wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults))
```

#### Luminus

**Luminus** is a full-featured web framework that provides a cohesive development experience by integrating various libraries and tools.

- **Core Principles**: Luminus aims to simplify web development by providing a comprehensive set of features out of the box, including database integration, templating, and authentication.

- **Features**: Luminus includes support for various databases, templating engines, and authentication mechanisms. It also provides a project template to quickly bootstrap new applications.

- **Use Cases**: Ideal for developers looking for a complete solution with minimal configuration.

- **Community Adoption**: Luminus has a strong community and extensive documentation, making it a popular choice for new projects.

**Example Code**:

```clojure
;; Luminus projects are typically generated using the Luminus template.
;; Here's a simple example of a Luminus route definition.

(defn home-page [request]
  (layout/render request "home.html"))

(defroutes home-routes
  (GET "/" [] home-page))
```

#### Pedestal

**Pedestal** is a framework designed for building high-performance web applications. It emphasizes asynchronous processing and is well-suited for real-time applications.

- **Core Principles**: Pedestal is built around the concept of interceptors, which are similar to middleware but offer more control over the request/response lifecycle.

- **Features**: Pedestal supports asynchronous processing, WebSockets, and server-sent events.

- **Use Cases**: Best suited for applications that require high concurrency and real-time capabilities.

- **Community Adoption**: Pedestal is favored by developers building complex, high-performance applications.

**Example Code**:

```clojure
(ns myapp.service
  (:require [io.pedestal.http :as http]
            [io.pedestal.http.route :as route]))

(defn home-page [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "Welcome to Pedestal!"})

(def routes
  (route/expand-routes
   #{["/" :get home-page]}))

(def service
  {:env :prod
   ::http/routes routes
   ::http/type :jetty
   ::http/port 8080})

(http/create-server service)
```

#### Reitit

**Reitit** is a fast and flexible routing library that supports both Ring and Pedestal. It offers a rich set of features for defining routes and handling requests.

- **Core Principles**: Reitit focuses on performance and flexibility, providing a data-driven approach to routing.

- **Features**: Reitit supports route parameter coercion, data-driven routing, and integration with various middleware.

- **Use Cases**: Suitable for applications that require complex routing logic and high performance.

- **Community Adoption**: Reitit is gaining popularity due to its performance and flexibility.

**Example Code**:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [reitit.ring :as ring]))

(def app
  (ring/ring-handler
   (ring/router
    [["/" {:get (fn [_] {:status 200 :body "Hello from Reitit!"})}]
     ["/hello/:name" {:get (fn [{{:keys [name]} :path-params}]
                             {:status 200 :body (str "Hello, " name)})}]])))

;; To run the app, use a Ring-compatible server like Jetty.
```

### Comparing Clojure Web Frameworks

When choosing a web framework for your Clojure project, consider the following factors:

- **Features**: Determine the features you need, such as routing, templating, database integration, and real-time capabilities.

- **Performance**: Consider the performance requirements of your application. Pedestal and Reitit are known for their high performance.

- **Community and Support**: Evaluate the community support and documentation available for each framework. Luminus and Compojure have strong community backing.

- **Flexibility**: Assess how much flexibility you need in terms of customization and integration with other libraries.

- **Use Cases**: Match the framework to your specific use case. For example, use Pedestal for real-time applications and Luminus for full-featured web applications.

### Selecting the Right Framework

To select the appropriate framework for your project, start by defining your project requirements. Consider the following questions:

- What are the core features your application needs?
- How important is performance and scalability?
- Do you need a full-featured framework or a lightweight solution?
- What is your team's familiarity with each framework?

By answering these questions, you can narrow down your options and choose a framework that aligns with your project's goals.

### Flexibility and Composability in Clojure Web Development

One of the strengths of the Clojure web development ecosystem is its flexibility and composability. The use of middleware and interceptors allows developers to build applications by composing small, reusable components. This approach encourages clean code and separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend applications over time.

### Conclusion

Clojure offers a rich set of web frameworks, each with its unique strengths and use cases. By understanding the core principles and features of Ring, Compojure, Luminus, Pedestal, and Reitit, you can make informed decisions about which framework best suits your project needs. Remember, the key to successful web development in Clojure is leveraging the flexibility and composability of the ecosystem to build robust and scalable applications.
