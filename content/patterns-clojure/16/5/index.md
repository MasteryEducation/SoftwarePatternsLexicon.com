## 16.5 Mocking and Stubbing in Clojure

In the realm of software testing, particularly unit testing, mocking and stubbing are essential techniques used to simulate external dependencies and control the behavior of the code under test. This section delves into how these techniques can be effectively applied in Clojure, leveraging its functional nature and powerful testing libraries.

### Introduction to Mocking and Stubbing

**Mocking** refers to the practice of creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. These mock objects are used to test the interactions between the unit under test and its dependencies. **Stubbing**, on the other hand, involves replacing a method or function with a pre-defined response, allowing you to control the environment in which the unit operates.

### Simulating Dependencies with `with-redefs`

Clojure provides a built-in mechanism called `with-redefs` that allows you to temporarily override the definitions of global vars. This is particularly useful for stubbing functions during tests.

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [myapp.core :as core]))

(deftest test-my-function
  (with-redefs [core/external-service (fn [_] "mocked response")]
    (is (= "mocked response" (core/my-function)))))
```

In this example, `external-service` is a function that interacts with an external system. By using `with-redefs`, we replace it with a mock function that returns a controlled response, allowing us to test `my-function` in isolation.

### Advanced Mocking with Libraries

For more complex scenarios, Clojure offers libraries such as `clojure.test/mock` that provide advanced mocking capabilities. These libraries allow you to create mocks that can verify interactions, such as the number of times a function was called or the arguments it was called with.

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [clojure.test.mock :as mock]
            [myapp.core :as core]))

(deftest test-my-function-with-mock
  (mock/with-mocks [core/external-service]
    (mock/stub! core/external-service (fn [_] "mocked response"))
    (is (= "mocked response" (core/my-function)))
    (mock/verify-call-times-for core/external-service 1)))
```

Here, `mock/with-mocks` is used to create a mock for `external-service`, and `mock/stub!` is used to define its behavior. The `mock/verify-call-times-for` function checks that `external-service` was called exactly once.

### Stubbing Out Side Effects

Stubbing is particularly useful for isolating side effects, such as database calls or network requests, which are not the focus of the test.

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [myapp.core :as core]))

(deftest test-function-with-side-effects
  (with-redefs [core/save-to-database (fn [_] :success)]
    (is (= :success (core/process-data)))))
```

In this test, `save-to-database` is stubbed to always return `:success`, allowing us to focus on testing `process-data` without worrying about the actual database interaction.

### Best Practices for Mocking and Stubbing

1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation:** Focus on verifying the behavior of the code rather than its implementation details. This ensures that tests remain robust against refactoring.

2. **Use Mocks and Stubs Sparingly:** Overuse of mocks and stubs can lead to brittle tests that are tightly coupled to the implementation. Use them judiciously to maintain test readability and reliability.

3. **Keep Tests Simple:** Avoid complex mocking setups that can make tests difficult to understand. Aim for simplicity and clarity.

4. **Verify Interactions When Necessary:** Use mocking libraries to verify interactions only when it is crucial to the test's purpose. Avoid excessive verification that can lead to false positives.

5. **Document Mocked Behavior:** Clearly document the behavior of mocks and stubs within the test to provide context for future maintainers.

### Importance of Testing Behavior

Testing the behavior of your code ensures that it meets the specified requirements and handles various scenarios correctly. By focusing on behavior, you can write tests that are more resilient to changes in the codebase, as they are not tied to specific implementation details.

### Conclusion

Mocking and stubbing are powerful techniques in the Clojure testing toolkit, enabling developers to isolate units of code and simulate complex interactions with external dependencies. By adhering to best practices and focusing on behavior-driven testing, you can create a robust test suite that enhances the reliability and maintainability of your Clojure applications.

> **Explanation:** Mocking is used to simulate the behavior of real objects, allowing you to test interactions between the unit under test and its dependencies.

### Which Clojure construct is used to temporarily override the definitions of global vars?

- [ ] def
- [x] with-redefs
- [ ] let
- [ ] defn

> **Explanation:** `with-redefs` is used to temporarily override the definitions of global vars in Clojure.

### What is the role of stubbing in unit testing?

- [ ] To verify the number of times a function was called
- [x] To replace a function with a pre-defined response
- [ ] To simulate the behavior of real objects
- [ ] To increase test coverage

> **Explanation:** Stubbing involves replacing a function with a pre-defined response, allowing you to control the environment for the unit under test.

### Which library provides advanced mocking capabilities in Clojure?

- [ ] clojure.core
- [ ] clojure.test
- [x] clojure.test/mock
- [ ] clojure.spec
