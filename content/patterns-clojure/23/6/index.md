## 23.6. Input Validation and Sanitization

In today's interconnected world, applications are constantly exposed to various forms of user input, making them vulnerable to injection attacks and data corruption. Input validation and sanitization are critical practices in software development, especially in languages like Clojure, which are often used for building robust, scalable systems. This section will guide you through the best practices for validating and sanitizing input in Clojure, using powerful tools like Spec and Schema.

### Understanding the Risks of Unvalidated Input

Before diving into the techniques, it's essential to understand why input validation and sanitization are crucial. Unvalidated input can lead to:

- **Injection Attacks**: Such as SQL injection, where malicious users can manipulate queries to access unauthorized data.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Where attackers inject scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- **Data Corruption**: Invalid data can cause application crashes or incorrect processing.
- **Security Breaches**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems.

### Key Concepts in Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Validation**: The process of checking if the input meets certain criteria before processing it. This ensures that the data is in the expected format and within acceptable ranges.
- **Sanitization**: The process of cleaning input to remove or escape potentially harmful content, making it safe to use within the application.

### Validation with Clojure Spec

Clojure's Spec library provides a powerful way to define and validate data structures. It allows you to specify the shape of your data and enforce constraints.

#### Defining Specifications

Let's start by defining a simple specification for a user entity:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.spec.alpha :as s])

(s/def ::username (s/and string? #(re-matches #"\w+" %)))
(s/def ::email (s/and string? #(re-matches #".+@.+\..+" %)))
(s/def ::age (s/and int? #(> % 0)))

(s/def ::user (s/keys :req [::username ::email ::age]))
```

- **Explanation**: Here, we define specs for `username`, `email`, and `age`. The `::user` spec combines these into a map with required keys.

#### Validating Data

To validate data against these specs, use `s/valid?`:

```clojure
(defn validate-user [user]
  (if (s/valid? ::user user)
    (println "User data is valid.")
    (println "User data is invalid.")))

(validate-user {:username "john_doe" :email "john@example.com" :age 30})
```

- **Explanation**: This function checks if the user data conforms to the `::user` spec and prints the result.

#### Generating Test Data

Spec can also generate test data, which is useful for testing:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen])

(gen/sample (s/gen ::user))
```

- **Explanation**: This generates sample data that conforms to the `::user` spec, aiding in testing and development.

### Validation with Schema

Schema is another popular library for data validation in Clojure. It provides a more declarative approach compared to Spec.

#### Defining Schemas

Here's how you can define a schema for a user:

```clojure
(require '[schema.core :as sch])

(def User
  {:username sch/Str
   :email sch/Str
   :age sch/Int})
```

- **Explanation**: We define a `User` schema with string and integer types for the fields.

#### Validating Data

To validate data against a schema, use `sch/validate`:

```clojure
(defn validate-user-schema [user]
  (try
    (sch/validate User user)
    (println "User data is valid.")
    (catch Exception e
      (println "User data is invalid:" (.getMessage e)))))

(validate-user-schema {:username "john_doe" :email "john@example.com" :age 30})
```

- **Explanation**: This function attempts to validate the user data and catches exceptions if the data is invalid.

### Sanitizing Input

Sanitization is crucial for removing or escaping potentially harmful content. Here are some techniques:

#### String Sanitization

For strings, you can remove or escape special characters:

```clojure
(defn sanitize-string [input]
  (clojure.string/escape input {\< "&lt;" \> "&gt;" \& "&amp;" \" "&quot;" \' "&#39;"}))

(sanitize-string "<script>alert('xss');</script>")
```

- **Explanation**: This function escapes HTML special characters to prevent XSS attacks.

#### File Upload Sanitization

When handling file uploads, ensure the file type and size are within acceptable limits:

```clojure
(defn sanitize-file [file]
  (let [allowed-types #{"image/png" "image/jpeg"}
        max-size 1048576] ; 1 MB
    (and (contains? allowed-types (:content-type file))
         (<= (:size file) max-size))))
```

- **Explanation**: This function checks if the file type is allowed and the size is within limits.

### Best Practices for Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Validate at All Entry Points**: Ensure validation occurs at every point where data enters the system, including APIs, user interfaces, and external integrations.
- **Use Whitelisting**: Prefer whitelisting over blacklisting for allowed values, as it's more secure.
- **Keep Validation and Sanitization Separate**: While they are related, keep these processes distinct to maintain clarity and flexibility.
- **Regularly Update Validation Rules**: As your application evolves, so should your validation rules to accommodate new requirements and threats.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Use automated tests to ensure your validation and sanitization logic is robust and handles edge cases.

### Visualizing the Validation and Sanitization Process

To better understand the flow of validation and sanitization, let's visualize it using a flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Receive Input] --> B{Validate Input};
    B -->|Valid| C[Process Data];
    B -->|Invalid| D[Reject Input];
    C --> E{Sanitize Data};
    E -->|Safe| F[Store/Use Data];
    E -->|Unsafe| D;
```

- **Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of receiving input, validating it, sanitizing it, and then either processing or rejecting it based on the outcome.
