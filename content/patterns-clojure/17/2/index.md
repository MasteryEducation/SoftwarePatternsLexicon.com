## 17.2. Libraries and Tools for Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) and data science are rapidly evolving fields that require robust tools and libraries to handle complex computations and data manipulations. Clojure, with its functional programming paradigm and seamless Java interoperability, offers a unique ecosystem for building machine learning applications. In this section, we will explore some of the key libraries and tools available in the Clojure ecosystem for machine learning, including their functionalities, use cases, and integration with Clojure.
