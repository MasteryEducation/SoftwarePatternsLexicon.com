## 17.9. Case Studies and Practical Examples

In this section, we delve into real-world examples and case studies that showcase the application of Clojure in machine learning and data science. These case studies highlight the problem statements, solutions, and outcomes, providing insights into the practical use of Clojure's unique features and design patterns. We will explore code excerpts, architectural diagrams, and discuss lessons learned and best practices derived from these projects.

### Case Study 1: Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing

#### Problem Statement

In the manufacturing industry, equipment downtime can lead to significant financial losses. Predictive maintenance aims to predict when equipment will fail, allowing for timely maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime. The challenge was to develop a predictive maintenance system using machine learning to analyze sensor data from manufacturing equipment.

#### Solution

The solution involved building a machine learning pipeline in Clojure to process and analyze sensor data. The pipeline included data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and deployment. Clojure's functional programming paradigm and immutable data structures were leveraged to ensure robustness and maintainability.

**Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**

```clojure
(ns predictive-maintenance.data
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.data.csv :as csv]))

(defn read-csv [file-path]
  (with-open [reader (io/reader file-path)]
    (doall
     (csv/read-csv reader))))

(defn preprocess-data [data]
  (map #(update % :timestamp parse-timestamp) data))

;; Example usage
(def raw-data (read-csv "sensor_data.csv"))
(def processed-data (preprocess-data raw-data))
```

**Feature Extraction and Model Training**

```clojure
(ns predictive-maintenance.model
  (:require [clojure.core.matrix :as m]
            [clojure.core.matrix.dataset :as ds]
            [clojure.ml :as ml]))

(defn extract-features [data]
  (map #(select-keys % [:temperature :vibration :pressure]) data))

(defn train-model [features labels]
  (ml/train :linear-regression features labels))

;; Example usage
(def features (extract-features processed-data))
(def labels (map :failure-time processed-data))
(def model (train-model features labels))
```

**Deployment and Monitoring**

The trained model was deployed as a RESTful API using Clojure's Ring and Compojure libraries, allowing integration with existing systems for real-time predictions.

```clojure
(ns predictive-maintenance.api
  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]]
            [cheshire.core :as json]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/predict" [temperature vibration pressure]
    (let [features {:temperature (Double/parseDouble temperature)
                    :vibration (Double/parseDouble vibration)
                    :pressure (Double/parseDouble pressure)}
          prediction (predict model features)]
      (json/generate-string {:prediction prediction}))))

(run-jetty app-routes {:port 8080})
```

#### Outcome

The predictive maintenance system successfully reduced equipment downtime by 30%, leading to significant cost savings. The use of Clojure's functional programming features ensured that the system was easy to maintain and extend.

#### Lessons Learned

### Case Study 2: Real-Time Sentiment Analysis for Social Media

#### Problem Statement

A social media analytics company wanted to perform real-time sentiment analysis on tweets to gauge public opinion on various topics. The challenge was to build a scalable system that could process and analyze large volumes of tweets in real-time.

#### Solution

The solution involved using Clojure's core.async library for concurrent processing and Kafka for message streaming. The system was designed to ingest tweets, perform sentiment analysis using a pre-trained model, and visualize the results in real-time.

**System Architecture**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Tweet Ingestion] --> B[Kafka Stream];
    B --> C[Sentiment Analysis];
    C --> D[Real-Time Dashboard];
```

**Tweet Ingestion and Streaming**

```clojure
(ns sentiment-analysis.ingestion
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [chan go-loop >!]]
            [clj-kafka.consumer :as kafka]))

(defn start-consumer [topic]
  (let [ch (chan)]
    (go-loop []
      (let [message (kafka/consume topic)]
        (>! ch message)
        (recur)))
    ch))

;; Example usage
(def tweet-channel (start-consumer "tweets"))
```

**Sentiment Analysis**

```clojure
(ns sentiment-analysis.core
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [<! go-loop]]
            [sentiment-model.core :as model]))

(defn analyze-sentiment [tweet]
  (model/predict-sentiment tweet))

(go-loop []
  (let [tweet (<! tweet-channel)
        sentiment (analyze-sentiment tweet)]
    (println "Sentiment:" sentiment)
    (recur)))
```

**Real-Time Dashboard**

The sentiment analysis results were visualized using a real-time dashboard built with ClojureScript and Reagent, providing insights into public opinion trends.

#### Outcome

The real-time sentiment analysis system enabled the company to provide timely insights to their clients, enhancing their decision-making processes. The system was able to handle thousands of tweets per second, demonstrating its scalability.

#### Lessons Learned

- **Concurrency**: Clojure's core.async library facilitated the handling of concurrent tweet processing, ensuring high throughput.
- **Scalability**: The use of Kafka for message streaming allowed the system to scale horizontally, accommodating increasing tweet volumes.
- **Visualization**: ClojureScript and Reagent provided a powerful combination for building interactive and responsive dashboards.

### Case Study 3: Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions

#### Problem Statement

A financial institution needed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time to prevent financial losses. The challenge was to build an anomaly detection system capable of analyzing transaction data and identifying suspicious activities.

#### Solution

The solution involved using Clojure's machine learning libraries to build an anomaly detection model. The system was designed to process transaction data, extract relevant features, and classify transactions as normal or anomalous.

**Feature Extraction and Model Training**

```clojure
(ns anomaly-detection.model
  (:require [clojure.core.matrix :as m]
            [clojure.ml :as ml]))

(defn extract-features [transaction]
  (select-keys transaction [:amount :location :time :merchant]))

(defn train-anomaly-model [transactions]
  (let [features (map extract-features transactions)
        labels (map :label transactions)]
    (ml/train :isolation-forest features labels)))

;; Example usage
(def transactions (read-csv "transactions.csv"))
(def anomaly-model (train-anomaly-model transactions))
```

**Real-Time Anomaly Detection**

```clojure
(ns anomaly-detection.core
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [chan go-loop >!]]
            [anomaly-detection.model :as model]))

(defn detect-anomalies [transaction]
  (let [features (extract-features transaction)]
    (model/predict anomaly-model features)))

(go-loop []
  (let [transaction (<! transaction-channel)
        anomaly? (detect-anomalies transaction)]
    (when anomaly?
      (println "Anomalous transaction detected:" transaction))
    (recur)))
```

#### Outcome

The anomaly detection system successfully identified fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, reducing financial losses for the institution. The system's real-time capabilities allowed for immediate response to suspicious activities.

#### Lessons Learned

- **Accuracy**: The use of isolation forest models provided high accuracy in detecting anomalies, minimizing false positives.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Clojure's core.async library enabled efficient real-time processing of transaction data.
