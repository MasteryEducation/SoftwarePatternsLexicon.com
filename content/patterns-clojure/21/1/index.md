## 21.1 Integrating with Pedestal for Web Applications

### Introduction to Pedestal

Pedestal is a powerful set of libraries designed to facilitate the development of fast, robust web applications and services in Clojure. It emphasizes immutability, simplicity, and modularity, making it an ideal choice for developers who value these principles in their software design.

### Framework Overview

Pedestal provides a comprehensive framework for building web applications that are both performant and maintainable. It leverages Clojure's strengths in functional programming and immutability to offer a robust platform for web development.

- **Immutability:** Pedestal encourages the use of immutable data structures, which leads to safer and more predictable code.
- **Simplicity:** The framework is designed to be straightforward, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with complex configurations.
- **Modularity:** Pedestal's architecture promotes modularity, enabling developers to compose applications from reusable components.

### Core Concepts

#### Services and Routes

In Pedestal, services and routes are fundamental concepts that define how incoming requests are processed and routed to the appropriate handlers.

- **Services:** A service in Pedestal is a collection of routes, interceptors, and configurations that define the behavior of your application.
- **Routes:** Routes map incoming HTTP requests to handler functions. They can be defined using a route table or routing functions.

```clojure
(def routes
  #{["/hello" :get `hello-handler]})
```

#### Interceptors

Interceptors are middleware components that process requests and responses. They provide a mechanism to implement cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

- **Enter:** Pre-process the request before it reaches the handler.
- **Leave:** Post-process the response after it leaves the handler.
- **Error:** Handle any errors that occur during request processing.

```clojure
(def my-interceptor
  {:name ::my-interceptor
   :enter (fn [context]
            ;; pre-processing
            context)
   :leave (fn [context]
            ;; post-processing
            context)})
```

### Setting Up a Pedestal Project

#### Dependencies

To get started with Pedestal, you need to add the necessary dependencies to your project. This typically includes `io.pedestal/pedestal.service` and a server adapter such as Jetty.

```clojure
:dependencies [[io.pedestal/pedestal.service "0.5.9"]
               [io.pedestal/pedestal.jetty "0.5.9"]]
```

#### Project Structure

Organize your Pedestal project into logical namespaces to maintain clarity and separation of concerns:

- **service:** Contains the main service definition and server configuration.
- **routes:** Defines the application's routing logic.
- **handlers:** Implements the request handlers.
- **interceptors:** Contains custom interceptors for request/response processing.

### Defining Routes and Handlers

#### Routes

Routes in Pedestal map URLs and HTTP methods to handler functions. They are defined in a route table, which is a set of route specifications.

```clojure
(def routes
  #{["/hello" :get `hello-handler]})
```

#### Handlers

Handlers are functions that accept a request map and return a response map. They are the core of your application's business logic.

```clojure
(defn hello-handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
   :body "Hello, World!"})
```

### Working with Interceptors

#### Built-in Interceptors

Pedestal provides a variety of built-in interceptors for common tasks such as JSON parsing and parameter extraction. These can be easily integrated into your application to handle routine processing.

#### Custom Interceptors

You can define custom interceptors to implement specific logic for your application. A custom interceptor consists of `:enter`, `:leave`, and `:error` functions.

```clojure
(def my-interceptor
  {:name ::my-interceptor
   :enter (fn [context]
            ;; pre-processing
            context)
   :leave (fn [context]
            ;; post-processing
            context)})
```

#### Applying Interceptors

Interceptors can be attached to individual routes or applied globally to the entire service. This flexibility allows you to tailor request processing to your application's needs.

### Starting the Server

#### Service Map

The service map is a configuration map that defines the service's routes, interceptors, and server options. It is the central configuration point for your Pedestal application.

```clojure
(def service
  {:env :prod
   ::http/routes routes
   ::http/interceptors interceptors
   ::http/type :jetty
   ::http/port 8080})
```

#### Running the Service

To start the server, use the `io.pedestal.http/start` function. This launches the server with the specified configuration.

```clojure
(defn -main [& args]
  (http/start (http/create-server service)))
```

### Design Patterns in Pedestal

#### Middleware Implementation

Interceptors in Pedestal serve as a powerful mechanism for implementing middleware. They allow you to add functionality such as authentication and logging in a modular and reusable manner.

#### Asynchronous Processing

Pedestal supports asynchronous request handling, enabling you to build responsive applications that can handle high loads efficiently.

#### Content Negotiation

Implement content negotiation to serve different response formats (e.g., JSON, XML) based on client preferences. This enhances the flexibility and usability of your API.

### Best Practices

#### Immutable Data Structures

Maintain immutability in request and response transformations to ensure thread safety and predictability.

#### Error Handling

Use error interceptors to manage exceptions and generate meaningful responses. This improves the robustness and user experience of your application.

#### Testing

Write unit tests for handlers and integration tests for the full service to ensure reliability and correctness.

### Performance Optimization

#### Thread Management

Configure thread pools appropriately for your workload to optimize performance and resource utilization.

#### Caching

Implement caching strategies using interceptors or external services to reduce latency and improve response times.

### Monitoring and Logging

#### Structured Logging

Use logging libraries to capture structured logs, which facilitate debugging and monitoring.

#### Metrics Collection

Integrate with monitoring tools to collect performance metrics and gain insights into your application's behavior.
