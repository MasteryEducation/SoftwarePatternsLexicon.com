## 21.5. Mocks and Stubs with `mock`

In the realm of software testing, especially unit testing, the concepts of mocks and stubs play a crucial role in isolating the code under test from its dependencies. This isolation ensures that tests are reliable, fast, and focused solely on the functionality of the unit being tested. In this section, we will delve into the use of mocks and stubs in Clojure, leveraging the [`mock`](https://github.com/circleci/mocked/blob/master/doc/user_guide.md) library to achieve effective testing practices.

### Understanding Mocks and Stubs

Before diving into the specifics of the `mock` library, let's clarify what mocks and stubs are and why they are essential in testing.

- **Mocks**: These are objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. They are used to verify interactions between the object under test and its dependencies. Mocks can be programmed to expect certain calls and can assert that these calls were made.

- **Stubs**: These are simplified implementations of interfaces or classes that return predefined responses. Unlike mocks, stubs do not verify interactions; they simply provide canned responses to method calls.

### The Purpose of Mocks and Stubs

Mocks and stubs are primarily used to:

- **Isolate the Unit Under Test**: By replacing real dependencies with mocks or stubs, we can ensure that the test focuses solely on the unit's behavior without interference from external systems.

- **Simulate External Dependencies**: Mocks and stubs allow us to simulate interactions with external systems such as databases, web services, or file systems, which might be unavailable or costly to use during testing.

- **Improve Test Performance**: By avoiding real interactions with external systems, tests run faster and are more reliable.

- **Facilitate Testing of Edge Cases**: Mocks and stubs can be configured to simulate rare or difficult-to-reproduce scenarios, enabling thorough testing of edge cases.

### Introducing the `mock` Library

The `mock` library in Clojure provides a straightforward way to create mocks and stubs. It allows you to define expectations for function calls, simulate return values, and verify that interactions occurred as expected.

#### Key Features of the `mock` Library

- **Function Mocking**: Easily mock Clojure functions to simulate their behavior.
- **Expectation Setting**: Define what calls are expected and what responses should be returned.
- **Verification**: Check that the expected interactions occurred during the test.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of mocking scenarios, including HTTP calls and database operations.

### Creating and Using Mocks with `mock`

Let's explore how to create and use mocks in Clojure tests using the `mock` library.

#### Setting Up the `mock` Library

First, ensure that the `mock` library is included in your project dependencies. Add the following to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[circleci/mocked "0.1.0"]]
```

#### Mocking Functions

To mock a function, use the `mock` macro provided by the library. Here's a simple example:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [mocked.core :refer :all]))

(defn fetch-data [url]
  ;; Simulate a function that fetches data from a URL
  (println "Fetching data from" url))

(deftest test-fetch-data
  (mock [fetch-data (fn [url] "mocked response")]
    (is (= "mocked response" (fetch-data "http://example.com")))))
```

In this example, we mock the `fetch-data` function to return a "mocked response" instead of executing its real implementation.

#### Mocking HTTP Calls

Mocking HTTP calls is a common requirement in testing. Here's how you can mock an HTTP call using the `mock` library:

```clojure
(ns myapp.http-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [mocked.core :refer :all]
            [clj-http.client :as client]))

(defn get-user [user-id]
  (client/get (str "http://api.example.com/users/" user-id)))

(deftest test-get-user
  (mock [client/get (fn [url] {:status 200 :body "mocked user data"})]
    (let [response (get-user 123)]
      (is (= 200 (:status response)))
      (is (= "mocked user data" (:body response))))))
```

In this test, we mock the `client/get` function to return a predefined response, simulating a successful HTTP call.

#### Mocking Database Operations

Database operations can also be mocked to test how your code interacts with a database without requiring a real database connection:

```clojure
(ns myapp.db-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [mocked.core :refer :all]))

(defn fetch-user-from-db [user-id]
  ;; Simulate a database fetch operation
  (println "Fetching user from database"))

(deftest test-fetch-user-from-db
  (mock [fetch-user-from-db (fn [user-id] {:id user-id :name "Mocked User"})]
    (let [user (fetch-user-from-db 123)]
      (is (= 123 (:id user)))
      (is (= "Mocked User" (:name user))))))
```

Here, we mock the `fetch-user-from-db` function to return a mock user object.

### Importance of Isolation in Unit Testing

Isolation is a fundamental principle in unit testing. By isolating the unit under test from its dependencies, we ensure that tests are:

- **Deterministic**: Tests produce the same results every time they are run, regardless of external factors.
- **Fast**: Tests execute quickly because they do not rely on slow external systems.
- **Focused**: Tests concentrate on the functionality of the unit under test, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

### Visualizing Mocking and Stubbing

To better understand the flow of mocking and stubbing, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Test
    participant Mock
    participant RealObject

    Test->>Mock: Define expectations
    Test->>Mock: Call mocked function
    Mock->>Test: Return mock response
    Test->>RealObject: Verify interactions
```

This diagram illustrates how the test interacts with the mock, which in turn simulates the behavior of the real object.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples provided:

- Change the mocked responses to simulate different scenarios.
- Add more complex logic to the mocked functions.
- Experiment with verifying interactions using the `verify` function from the `mock` library.
