## 4.9. The Build Tools: Leiningen and Tools.deps

In the Clojure ecosystem, managing dependencies and building projects efficiently are crucial tasks that can significantly impact the development workflow. Two primary tools facilitate these tasks: **Leiningen** and **Tools.deps**. Each offers unique features and capabilities, catering to different needs and preferences. In this section, we'll explore these tools in detail, compare their functionalities, and guide you on choosing the right tool for your project.

### Introduction to Leiningen

Leiningen is a popular build automation tool for Clojure, designed to simplify the management of projects, dependencies, and tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of features that streamline the development process, making it a go-to choice for many Clojure developers.

#### Key Features of Leiningen

- **Dependency Management**: Leiningen uses a `project.clj` file to specify project dependencies, which are automatically resolved and downloaded.
- **Task Automation**: It supports a wide range of tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Leiningen boasts a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, allowing developers to customize their build processes.
- **REPL Integration**: It offers seamless integration with the Clojure REPL, enhancing interactive development.
- **Profiles**: Leiningen supports profiles, enabling different configurations for various environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

#### Common Leiningen Commands

Here are some of the most frequently used Leiningen commands:

- `lein new app <project-name>`: Creates a new Clojure application project.
- `lein deps`: Downloads and installs project dependencies.
- `lein run`: Runs the main function of the project.
- `lein test`: Executes the project's test suite.
- `lein uberjar`: Packages the project into a standalone JAR file.

#### Setting Up a Project with Leiningen

To create a new Clojure project using Leiningen, follow these steps:

1. **Install Leiningen**: Follow the instructions on the [Leiningen website](https://leiningen.org/) to install Leiningen on your system.

2. **Create a New Project**: Use the `lein new` command to generate a new project structure.

   ```bash
   lein new app my-clojure-app
   ```

   This command creates a directory named `my-clojure-app` with the necessary files and folders.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the newly created project directory.

   ```bash
   cd my-clojure-app
   ```

4. **Run the Project**: Use the `lein run` command to execute the main function.

   ```bash
   lein run
   ```

5. **Add Dependencies**: Edit the `project.clj` file to include any additional dependencies your project requires.

   ```clojure
   (defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
     :description "A simple Clojure application"
     :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                    [compojure "1.6.2"]])
   ```

6. **Download Dependencies**: Run `lein deps` to download and install the specified dependencies.

   ```bash
   lein deps
   ```

### Introduction to Tools.deps

Tools.deps, also known as the Clojure CLI, is a lightweight tool for managing dependencies and running Clojure programs. It emphasizes simplicity and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for developers who prefer a more hands-on approach to dependency management.

#### Key Features of Tools.deps

- **Dependency Management**: Tools.deps uses a `deps.edn` file to define dependencies, allowing for fine-grained control over dependency versions and sources.
- **Simplicity**: It provides a minimalistic approach, focusing on dependency resolution and execution without additional build automation features.
- **Interoperability**: Tools.deps integrates seamlessly with other tools and libraries, making it easy to incorporate into existing workflows.
- **Customizable Classpaths**: It allows developers to define custom classpaths, enabling precise control over the runtime environment.

#### Setting Up a Project with Tools.deps

To create a new Clojure project using Tools.deps, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Clojure CLI**: Follow the instructions on the [Clojure website](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) to install the Clojure CLI tools.

2. **Create a Project Directory**: Manually create a directory for your project.

   ```bash
   mkdir my-clojure-app
   cd my-clojure-app
   ```

3. **Create a `deps.edn` File**: Define your project's dependencies in a `deps.edn` file.

   ```clojure
   {:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
           compojure {:mvn/version "1.6.2"}}}
   ```

4. **Run the REPL**: Use the `clj` command to start a Clojure REPL with the specified dependencies.

   ```bash
   clj
   ```

5. **Run a Script**: Create a Clojure script file (e.g., `main.clj`) and execute it using the `clj` command.

   ```bash
   clj -M -m my-clojure-app.core
   ```

### Comparing Leiningen and Tools.deps

Both Leiningen and Tools.deps serve the purpose of managing dependencies and facilitating project development, but they differ in their approach and capabilities.
