## 4.19. Versioning and Release Management

In the world of software development, versioning and release management are critical components that ensure the smooth evolution and deployment of applications. This section delves into the strategies and tools available for versioning Clojure applications and libraries, with a focus on semantic versioning, project versioning in Leiningen and Deps.edn, and best practices for release management.

### Introduction to Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme that conveys meaning about the underlying changes in a release. It follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- **MAJOR** version increments indicate incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version increments add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version increments are for backward-compatible bug fixes.

**Importance of Semantic Versioning:**

- **Predictability**: Users can anticipate the impact of an upgrade.
- **Compatibility**: Developers can manage dependencies more effectively.
- **Communication**: It provides a clear communication channel between developers and users.

For more information on semantic versioning, you can refer to the [official SemVer website](https://semver.org/).

### Versioning Projects in Leiningen

Leiningen is a popular build automation tool for Clojure, and it provides robust support for versioning projects.

#### Setting Up Versioning in Leiningen

To version a project in Leiningen, you define the version in the `project.clj` file. Here's an example:

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "1.0.0"
  :description "A sample Clojure application"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]])
```

**Key Points:**

- The version string follows the SemVer format.
- Update the version string manually or use plugins to automate this process.

#### Automating Versioning with Leiningen Plugins

Leiningen supports plugins that can automate versioning tasks. One such plugin is [lein-release](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/PROFILES.md#release), which simplifies the process of preparing a release.

**Using lein-release:**

1. **Add the plugin to your project:**

   ```clojure
   :plugins [[lein-release "1.0.9"]]
   ```

2. **Configure the release process:**

   ```clojure
   :release-tasks [["vcs" "assert-committed"]
                   ["change" "version" "leiningen.release/bump-version" "release"]
                   ["vcs" "commit"]
                   ["vcs" "tag"]
                   ["deploy"]]
   ```

3. **Run the release command:**

   ```bash
   lein release
   ```

This command sequence ensures that your code is committed, tagged, and deployed, following the version bump.

### Versioning Projects with Deps.edn

Deps.edn is another tool for managing Clojure projects, particularly those that use the Clojure CLI tools.

#### Setting Up Versioning in Deps.edn

Unlike Leiningen, Deps.edn does not have a built-in versioning mechanism, as it focuses on dependency management. However, you can manage versions by using tags in your version control system or by integrating with external tools.

**Example Deps.edn File:**

```clojure
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}}}
```

**Version Management Strategies:**

- **Git Tags**: Use Git tags to manage versions. For example, tag a commit with `v1.0.0` to indicate a release.
- **External Tools**: Use tools like `git-version` to extract version information from Git tags.

### Release Management Practices

Release management involves planning, scheduling, and controlling the build, testing, and deployment of releases. Here are some best practices:

#### Establish a Release Process

1. **Define Release Criteria**: Set clear criteria for what constitutes a release, including code quality, testing, and documentation standards.
2. **Automate Builds and Tests**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and test process, ensuring consistency and reliability.
3. **Document Changes**: Maintain a changelog to document changes in each release, aiding transparency and communication.

#### Tools for Automated Releases

Automated release processes reduce human error and increase efficiency. Here are some tools and strategies:

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Use platforms like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions to automate the release pipeline.
- **Leiningen Plugins**: As mentioned, plugins like `lein-release` can automate versioning and deployment tasks.
- **Git Hooks**: Use Git hooks to trigger scripts for versioning and deployment upon certain actions, like committing or pushing code.

### Example: Setting Up Automated Releases with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

**Sample GitHub Actions Workflow:**

```yaml
name: Clojure CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: '11'
    - name: Install Clojure CLI
      run: sudo apt-get install -y clojure
    - name: Run tests
      run: clojure -M:test
    - name: Deploy
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: |
        lein release
```

This workflow checks out the code, sets up the Java environment, installs Clojure, runs tests, and deploys the application when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Conclusion

Versioning and release management are essential practices in software development, ensuring that applications evolve predictably and reliably. By leveraging tools like Leiningen, Deps.edn, and CI/CD platforms, you can automate and streamline these processes, allowing you to focus on building robust and feature-rich applications.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the examples provided by setting up a simple Clojure project and configuring versioning and release management using Leiningen or Deps.edn. Modify the GitHub Actions workflow to suit your project's needs and observe how automation can enhance your development workflow.
