## 15.6. RESTful Services and HTTP Clients with `clj-http` and `http-kit`

In the modern software landscape, integrating with RESTful services is a common requirement. Clojure, with its rich ecosystem, provides powerful libraries like `clj-http` and `http-kit` to facilitate HTTP communication. This section will guide you through the essentials of using these libraries to interact with RESTful APIs, covering everything from basic requests to advanced asynchronous handling and performance optimization.

### Introduction to `clj-http` and `http-kit`

**`clj-http`** is a Clojure HTTP client inspired by the Apache HttpClient. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for making synchronous HTTP requests.

**`http-kit`**, on the other hand, is a high-performance HTTP server and client library. It is designed for both synchronous and asynchronous operations, providing a flexible solution for building web applications and consuming APIs.

#### Use Cases

- **`clj-http`**: Ideal for applications where simplicity and ease of use are prioritized, and synchronous requests are sufficient.
- **`http-kit`**: Suitable for high-performance applications requiring asynchronous request handling and server capabilities.

### Making HTTP Requests

Let's explore how to perform basic HTTP operations using `clj-http` and `http-kit`.

#### GET Request

**`clj-http` Example:**

```clojure
(require '[clj-http.client :as client])

(defn fetch-data [url]
  (let [response (client/get url)]
    (println (:status response))
    (println (:body response))))
```

**`http-kit` Example:**

```clojure
(require '[org.httpkit.client :as http])

(defn fetch-data [url]
  (http/get url
            (fn [{:keys [status body]}]
              (println status)
              (println body))))
```

#### POST Request

**`clj-http` Example:**

```clojure
(defn post-data [url data]
  (let [response (client/post url {:body (json/write-str data)
                                   :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json"}})]
    (println (:status response))
    (println (:body response))))
```

**`http-kit` Example:**

```clojure
(defn post-data [url data]
  (http/post url
             {:body (json/write-str data)
              :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json"}}
             (fn [{:keys [status body]}]
               (println status)
               (println body))))
```

#### PUT and DELETE Requests

Both libraries support PUT and DELETE requests similarly to GET and POST. You can specify the method and options accordingly.

### Handling Headers, Query Parameters, and Request Bodies

#### Headers and Query Parameters

**`clj-http` Example:**

```clojure
(defn fetch-with-params [url params headers]
  (client/get url {:query-params params
                   :headers headers}))
```

**`http-kit` Example:**

```clojure
(defn fetch-with-params [url params headers]
  (http/get url {:query-params params
                 :headers headers}
            (fn [{:keys [status body]}]
              (println status)
              (println body))))
```

#### Request Bodies

For POST and PUT requests, you can include a body in the request. Ensure the content type is set appropriately, such as `application/json` for JSON data.

### Best Practices for Managing Connections and Timeouts

- **Connection Management**: Use connection pooling to manage resources efficiently.
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging requests. Both libraries allow you to specify timeouts in milliseconds.

**`clj-http` Example:**

```clojure
(client/get url {:socket-timeout 1000
                 :conn-timeout 1000})
```

**`http-kit` Example:**

```clojure
(http/get url {:timeout 1000}
          (fn [response] ...))
```

### Asynchronous Requests and Performance Considerations

**`http-kit`** excels in handling asynchronous requests, making it suitable for high-performance applications. It uses a non-blocking architecture, allowing you to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking threads.

#### Asynchronous Example with `http-kit`

```clojure
(defn async-fetch [url]
  (http/get url
            {:timeout 5000}
            (fn [{:keys [status body error]}]
              (if error
                (println "Failed, exception is " error)
                (println "Async HTTP GET: " status body)))))
```

### Visualizing HTTP Request Flow

To better understand the flow of HTTP requests and responses, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    Client->>Server: HTTP Request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
    Server-->>Client: HTTP Response (Status, Body)
```

This diagram illustrates the basic interaction between a client and a server during an HTTP request.
