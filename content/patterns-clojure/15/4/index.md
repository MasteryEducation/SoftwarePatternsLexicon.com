## 15.4. Working with Databases Using JDBC and Datahike

In modern software development, databases play a crucial role in storing and managing data. Clojure, with its functional programming paradigm, provides robust tools for interacting with both relational and graph databases. In this section, we will explore how to work with databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and Datahike, a durable Datalog database. We will cover connecting to databases, executing queries, managing transactions, and leveraging Datahike's graph-based data capabilities.

### Introduction to JDBC in Clojure

JDBC is a Java-based API that allows you to connect to a wide range of relational databases. Clojure, being a JVM language, can leverage JDBC to interact with databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

#### Connecting to a Database Using JDBC

To connect to a database using JDBC in Clojure, you need to include the necessary dependencies in your project. For example, to connect to a PostgreSQL database, you would add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
               [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.12"]
               [org.postgresql/postgresql "42.2.18"]]
```

Next, you can establish a connection using the `clojure.java.jdbc` library:

```clojure
(ns myapp.database
  (:require [clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc]))

(def db-spec
  {:dbtype "postgresql"
   :dbname "mydatabase"
   :host "localhost"
   :port 5432
   :user "myuser"
   :password "mypassword"})

(defn connect-to-db []
  (jdbc/get-connection db-spec))
```

#### Executing Queries and Managing Transactions

Once connected, you can execute SQL queries and manage transactions. The `clojure.java.jdbc` library provides functions like `query`, `insert!`, `update!`, and `delete!` to interact with the database.

```clojure
(defn fetch-users []
  (jdbc/query db-spec ["SELECT * FROM users"]))

(defn add-user [user]
  (jdbc/insert! db-spec :users user))

(defn update-user [id user]
  (jdbc/update! db-spec :users user ["id=?" id]))

(defn delete-user [id]
  (jdbc/delete! db-spec :users ["id=?" id]))

(defn transaction-example []
  (jdbc/with-db-transaction [tx db-spec]
    (jdbc/insert! tx :users {:name "Alice" :email "alice@example.com"})
    (jdbc/insert! tx :users {:name "Bob" :email "bob@example.com"})))
```

### Introduction to Datahike

Datahike is a durable Datalog database that provides graph-based data capabilities. It is built on top of Datomic's architecture and offers features like schema definition, immutability, and time travel.

#### Setting Up Datahike

To use Datahike, you need to add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
               [com.github.replikativ/datahike "0.3.6"]]
```

#### Defining a Schema in Datahike

Datahike requires a schema to define the structure of your data. A schema is a collection of attributes that describe the types and constraints of your data.

```clojure
(ns myapp.datahike
  (:require [datahike.api :as d]))

(def schema
  [{:db/ident :person/name
    :db/valueType :db.type/string
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
   {:db/ident :person/age
    :db/valueType :db.type/long
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
   {:db/ident :person/friends
    :db/valueType :db.type/ref
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many}])

(def config
  {:store {:backend :file
           :path "/path/to/datahike"}})

(defn setup-database []
  (d/create-database config)
  (d/connect config)
  (d/transact conn {:tx-data schema}))
```

#### Querying Data with Datahike

Datahike uses Datalog, a declarative query language, to interact with the database. You can perform complex queries using Datalog syntax.

```clojure
(defn find-persons-by-name [name]
  (d/q '[:find ?e
         :in $ ?name
         :where [?e :person/name ?name]]
       (d/db conn) name))

(defn add-person [name age]
  (d/transact conn {:tx-data [{:person/name name
                               :person/age age}]}))
```

### Best Practices for Performance and Security

When working with databases, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure performance and security.

- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Indexing**: Create indexes on frequently queried fields to improve query performance.
- **Schema Design**: Design your schema carefully to accommodate future changes and scalability.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

### Visualizing Database Interactions

To better understand the interaction between Clojure, JDBC, and Datahike, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Clojure Application
    participant J as JDBC
    participant DB as Database
    participant D as Datahike

    C->>J: Connect to Database
    J->>DB: Establish Connection
    C->>J: Execute SQL Query
    J->>DB: Run Query
    DB-->>J: Return Results
    J-->>C: Return Data

    C->>D: Connect to Datahike
    D->>D: Setup Schema
    C->>D: Execute Datalog Query
    D-->>C: Return Results
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics, it's time to try it yourself. Experiment with the code examples provided, and try modifying them to suit your needs. For instance, you can:

- Add more attributes to the Datahike schema.
- Implement additional SQL queries using JDBC.
- Explore Datahike's time travel feature by querying historical data.
