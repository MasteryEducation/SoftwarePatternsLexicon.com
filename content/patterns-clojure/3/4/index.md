## 3.4. Higher-Order Functions and Function Composition

In the realm of functional programming, higher-order functions and function composition are foundational concepts that empower developers to write concise, reusable, and expressive code. Clojure, as a functional language, embraces these principles, providing a rich set of tools to manipulate functions and data seamlessly. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of higher-order functions and function composition, exploring their significance and application in Clojure.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This capability allows for a high degree of abstraction and modularity in code. In Clojure, higher-order functions are ubiquitous, enabling developers to build complex operations from simple, reusable components.

#### Key Characteristics of Higher-Order Functions

1. **Function as Argument**: A higher-order function can accept one or more functions as parameters.
2. **Function as Return Value**: It can return a function as its result.
3. **Abstraction and Reusability**: By abstracting common patterns, higher-order functions promote code reuse and reduce redundancy.

#### Common Higher-Order Functions in Clojure

Clojure provides several built-in higher-order functions that are essential for data processing and transformation. Let's explore some of these functions with examples.

##### `map`

The `map` function applies a given function to each element of a collection, returning a new collection of results.

```clojure
;; Example: Using map to square each number in a list
(def numbers [1 2 3 4 5])

(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

(def squared-numbers (map square numbers))
;; => (1 4 9 16 25)

;; Using an anonymous function
(def squared-numbers-anon (map #( * % %) numbers))
;; => (1 4 9 16 25)
```

##### `filter`

The `filter` function selects elements from a collection that satisfy a predicate function, returning a new collection of those elements.

```clojure
;; Example: Filtering even numbers from a list
(defn even? [x]
  (zero? (mod x 2)))

(def even-numbers (filter even? numbers))
;; => (2 4)

;; Using an anonymous function
(def even-numbers-anon (filter #(zero? (mod % 2)) numbers))
;; => (2 4)
```

##### `reduce`

The `reduce` function processes elements of a collection using a binary function, accumulating a single result.

```clojure
;; Example: Summing numbers in a list
(def sum (reduce + numbers))
;; => 15

;; Using a custom function
(defn sum-fn [acc x]
  (+ acc x))

(def sum-custom (reduce sum-fn 0 numbers))
;; => 15
```

### Function Composition in Clojure

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. This technique is invaluable for creating complex operations from simpler ones, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

#### The `comp` Function

The `comp` function in Clojure is used to compose multiple functions into a single function. The composed function applies the rightmost function first and the leftmost function last.

```clojure
;; Example: Composing functions to convert a string to uppercase and then reverse it
(defn uppercase [s]
  (.toUpperCase s))

(defn reverse-str [s]
  (apply str (reverse s)))

(def transform (comp reverse-str uppercase))

(def result (transform "clojure"))
;; => "ERUJOLC"
```

#### The `partial` Function

The `partial` function creates a new function by pre-filling some arguments of an existing function. This is useful for creating specialized versions of more general functions.

```clojure
;; Example: Creating a partially applied function to add 10 to a number
(def add (partial + 10))

(def result (add 5))
;; => 15
```

### Advantages of Function Composition

1. **Code Reusability**: By composing functions, we can reuse existing functions to create new functionality without rewriting code.
2. **Improved Readability**: Composed functions often express the intent of the code more clearly, making it easier to understand.
3. **Modularity**: Function composition encourages breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions.

### Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to solidify our understanding of higher-order functions and function composition in Clojure.

#### Example 1: Data Transformation Pipeline

Suppose we have a list of numbers, and we want to filter out odd numbers, square the remaining numbers, and then sum them up.

```clojure
(def numbers [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])

(defn process-numbers [nums]
  (->> nums
       (filter even?)
       (map square)
       (reduce +)))

(def result (process-numbers numbers))
;; => 220
```

In this example, we use the threading macro `->>` to create a pipeline that processes the numbers step by step.

#### Example 2: Composing String Manipulations

Let's create a composed function that trims whitespace, converts a string to lowercase, and then replaces spaces with hyphens.

```clojure
(defn trim [s]
  (.trim s))

(defn lowercase [s]
  (.toLowerCase s))

(defn replace-spaces [s]
  (clojure.string/replace s " " "-"))

(def transform-string (comp replace-spaces lowercase trim))

(def result (transform-string "  Hello World  "))
;; => "hello-world"
```

### Visualizing Function Composition

To better understand function composition, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input String] --> B[Trim];
    B --> C[Lowercase];
    C --> D[Replace Spaces];
    D --> E[Output String];
```

This flowchart represents the sequence of transformations applied to the input string, resulting in the final output.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the functions or creating new compositions to see how they behave. For instance, you could:

- Change the predicate in the `filter` function to select odd numbers instead.
- Create a new composed function that first reverses a string and then converts it to uppercase.
- Use `partial` to create a function that multiplies a number by a fixed factor.

### Knowledge Check

To reinforce your understanding, let's test your knowledge with some questions.

- [x] 10
- [ ] 24
- [ ] 0
- [ ] 1

> **Explanation:** The `reduce` function processes elements of a collection using a binary function, accumulating a single result. In this case, it sums the numbers, resulting in 10.

### Which of the following is NOT a higher-order function?

- [ ] map
- [ ] filter
- [ ] reduce
- [x] println

> **Explanation:** `println` is not a higher-order function because it does not take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
