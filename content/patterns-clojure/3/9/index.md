## 3.9. The Expression-Oriented Nature of Clojure

In the realm of programming languages, Clojure stands out with its expression-oriented nature, a feature that significantly influences how developers write and reason about code. This characteristic means that almost everything in Clojure is an expression that returns a value, promoting a style of programming that is both declarative and composable. In this section, we will delve into what it means for a language to be expression-oriented, explore the implications for control flow constructs, and demonstrate how this leads to more concise and readable code. We will also highlight the benefits for function composition and encourage you to embrace this mindset in your Clojure development.

### What Does It Mean to Be Expression-Oriented?

In an expression-oriented language, every construct, including control flow statements, is an expression that evaluates to a value. This contrasts with statement-oriented languages, where some constructs do not return values and are used primarily for their side effects. In Clojure, the emphasis on expressions allows for a more functional approach to programming, where the focus is on what to compute rather than how to compute it.

#### Expressions vs. Statements

To understand the distinction, let's compare expressions and statements:

- **Expressions**: These are constructs that produce a value. For example, `(+ 1 2)` is an expression that evaluates to `3`.
- **Statements**: These are constructs that perform an action but do not produce a value. In languages like Java or C, `if` and `for` are statements.

In Clojure, even constructs like `if`, `when`, and `doseq` are expressions, meaning they return values. This allows for more flexible and concise code, as you can nest expressions and pass them as arguments to functions.

### Implications for Control Flow Constructs

The expression-oriented nature of Clojure has profound implications for control flow constructs. Let's explore how common control flow constructs behave as expressions in Clojure.

#### The `if` Expression

In Clojure, `if` is an expression that evaluates to one of two values based on a condition. Here's a simple example:

```clojure
(defn check-number [n]
  (if (even? n)
    "Even"
    "Odd"))

;; Usage
(check-number 4) ;=> "Even"
(check-number 5) ;=> "Odd"
```

In this example, `if` returns either "Even" or "Odd" based on whether the number is even or odd.

#### The `when` Expression

The `when` expression is similar to `if`, but it is used when there is only one branch of execution. It returns `nil` if the condition is false:

```clojure
(defn print-even [n]
  (when (even? n)
    (println "Even number")))

;; Usage
(print-even 4) ; Prints "Even number"
(print-even 5) ; Does nothing
```

#### The `doseq` Expression

The `doseq` expression is used for iterating over collections, and it returns `nil`. However, it is still considered an expression because it can be composed with other expressions:

```clojure
(doseq [n (range 5)]
  (println n))
```

This prints numbers from 0 to 4, but the entire `doseq` expression evaluates to `nil`.

### Conciseness and Readability

The expression-oriented nature of Clojure leads to more concise and readable code. By treating control flow constructs as expressions, you can nest them and pass them as arguments to functions, reducing the need for temporary variables and intermediate steps.

#### Example: Calculating Factorials

Consider the task of calculating a factorial. In a statement-oriented language, you might write:

```java
int factorial(int n) {
  int result = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
}
```

In Clojure, you can achieve the same result with a more concise expression:

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (reduce * (range 1 (inc n))))

;; Usage
(factorial 5) ;=> 120
```

Here, `reduce` is used to multiply all numbers in the range, and the entire operation is an expression that returns the factorial.

### Benefits for Function Composition

The ability to treat everything as an expression enhances function composition, a core principle of functional programming. In Clojure, you can compose functions by passing the result of one expression as the input to another, creating pipelines of transformations.

#### Example: Data Transformation Pipeline

Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to filter out odd numbers, square the remaining numbers, and then sum them. In Clojure, you can achieve this with a composition of expressions:

```clojure
(defn process-numbers [numbers]
  (->> numbers
       (filter even?)
       (map #(* % %))
       (reduce +)))

;; Usage
(process-numbers [1 2 3 4 5 6]) ;=> 56
```

In this example, `->>` is a threading macro that helps in composing functions by passing the result of each expression to the next.

### Embracing the Expression-Oriented Mindset

To fully leverage the power of Clojure, it's essential to embrace the expression-oriented mindset. This involves thinking in terms of values and transformations rather than actions and side effects. Here are some tips to help you adopt this mindset:

- **Think Declaratively**: Focus on what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it. Use expressions to describe transformations and computations.
- **Compose Functions**: Use function composition to build complex operations from simple expressions. This leads to more modular and reusable code.
- **Avoid Side Effects**: Minimize side effects by using pure functions and immutable data structures. This makes your code easier to reason about and test.
- **Leverage Clojure's Features**: Take advantage of Clojure's rich set of core functions and macros to express your logic concisely and clearly.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of Clojure's expression-oriented nature, try modifying the examples provided. Experiment with different control flow constructs and see how they can be composed to achieve various tasks. Here are some suggestions:

- Modify the `check-number` function to return a custom message for negative numbers.
- Extend the `process-numbers` function to include additional transformations, such as filtering numbers greater than a certain value.
- Create a new function that uses `doseq` to iterate over a collection and perform a side effect, such as logging each element.

### Visualizing Expression-Oriented Programming

To better understand how expressions flow in Clojure, let's visualize a simple program using a flowchart. This diagram illustrates the flow of data through a series of expressions:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Check if number is even]
    B -->|Yes| C[Return "Even"]
    B -->|No| D[Return "Odd"]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E
```

This flowchart represents the logic of the `check-number` function, showing how the decision point (checking if a number is even) leads to different outcomes based on the condition.
