## 8.5. Template Method Pattern Using Protocols

### Introduction

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. In Clojure, we can leverage protocols to implement this pattern, providing a flexible yet controlled way to define algorithms.

### Intent of the Template Method Pattern

The primary intent of the Template Method Pattern is to define the overall structure of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to implement specific steps. This pattern promotes code reuse and enforces a consistent algorithm structure across different implementations.

### Protocols in Clojure

In Clojure, protocols provide a mechanism for polymorphism, allowing us to define a set of functions that can be implemented by different types. Protocols are similar to interfaces in object-oriented languages but are more flexible and dynamic.

### Using Protocols to Implement the Template Method Pattern

In the context of the Template Method Pattern, protocols can be used to define the fixed structure of an algorithm. Implementations of the protocol can then provide the specific details for each step of the algorithm.

#### Example: Data Processing Pipeline

Let's consider a data processing pipeline where we want to define a fixed sequence of steps, but allow different implementations to provide the details for each step.

```clojure
(defprotocol DataProcessor
  (fetch-data [this])
  (process-data [this data])
  (save-results [this results]))

(defn execute-pipeline [processor]
  (let [data (fetch-data processor)
        processed-data (process-data processor data)]
    (save-results processor processed-data)))
```

In this example, `DataProcessor` is a protocol that defines three steps: `fetch-data`, `process-data`, and `save-results`. The `execute-pipeline` function defines the fixed structure of the algorithm, calling each step in sequence.

#### Implementing the Protocol

Now, let's implement the `DataProcessor` protocol for a specific type of data processing.

```clojure
(defrecord CsvProcessor []
  DataProcessor
  (fetch-data [this]
    ;; Fetch data from a CSV file
    (println "Fetching data from CSV")
    ;; Simulate data fetching
    ["row1" "row2" "row3"])
  (process-data [this data]
    ;; Process the CSV data
    (println "Processing CSV data")
    ;; Simulate data processing
    (map clojure.string/upper-case data))
  (save-results [this results]
    ;; Save the processed results
    (println "Saving results")
    ;; Simulate saving results
    (doseq [result results]
      (println "Saved:" result))))

(def csv-processor (->CsvProcessor))

(execute-pipeline csv-processor)
```

In this implementation, `CsvProcessor` is a record that implements the `DataProcessor` protocol. Each method provides the specific details for fetching, processing, and saving data.

### Balancing Flexibility and Control

The Template Method Pattern using protocols strikes a balance between flexibility and control. The fixed structure of the algorithm ensures consistency, while the protocol implementations provide flexibility to customize each step.

### Differences from Object-Oriented Implementations

In object-oriented languages, the Template Method Pattern is typically implemented using inheritance, where a base class defines the template method and subclasses override specific steps. In Clojure, we use protocols to achieve a similar effect, but with more flexibility and less coupling between the template and its implementations.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

Let's visualize the Template Method Pattern using a class diagram to illustrate the relationship between the protocol and its implementations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DataProcessor {
        <<protocol>>
        +fetch-data()
        +process-data(data)
        +save-results(results)
    }
    class CsvProcessor {
        +fetch-data()
        +process-data(data)
        +save-results(results)
    }
    DataProcessor <|-- CsvProcessor
```

This diagram shows the `DataProcessor` protocol and its implementation by the `CsvProcessor` record. The arrows indicate that `CsvProcessor` implements the `DataProcessor` protocol.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by creating a new implementation of the `DataProcessor` protocol. For example, you could implement a `JsonProcessor` that fetches data from a JSON file and processes it differently.
