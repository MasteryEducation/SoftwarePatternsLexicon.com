## 11.3. Integration with External Systems

In today's interconnected world, software systems rarely operate in isolation. They must communicate with databases, web services, legacy systems, and more. This section explores how Clojure, with its functional programming paradigm and JVM interoperability, excels in integrating with external systems. We'll cover databases, web services, message queues, and best practices for resilience and error handling.

### Importance of Interoperability in Enterprise Environments

Interoperability is crucial in enterprise environments where diverse systems need to work together seamlessly. Clojure's ability to run on the JVM makes it a powerful tool for integration, allowing it to leverage existing Java libraries and frameworks. This capability is essential for:

- **Connecting to Databases**: Accessing and manipulating data stored in relational and non-relational databases.
- **Consuming and Producing Web Services**: Interacting with RESTful and SOAP-based services for data exchange.
- **Interacting with Message Queues**: Facilitating asynchronous communication between distributed systems.
- **Integrating with Legacy Systems**: Bridging the gap between modern applications and older technologies.

### Connecting to Databases

Databases are the backbone of most applications, storing critical data that applications need to access and manipulate. Clojure provides several ways to connect to databases, with JDBC being the most common method.

#### Using JDBC with Clojure

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a standard Java API for database access. Clojure can leverage JDBC to interact with databases, allowing developers to execute SQL queries and manage transactions.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec
  {:dbtype "h2" :dbname "test"})

;; Create a table
(jdbc/execute! db-spec ["CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50))"])

;; Insert a record
(jdbc/insert! db-spec :users {:id 1 :name "Alice"})

;; Query the database
(jdbc/query db-spec ["SELECT * FROM users"])
```

In this example, we define a database specification and use `clojure.java.jdbc` to create a table, insert a record, and query the database.

#### Leveraging `next.jdbc`

[next.jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc) is a modern, idiomatic Clojure wrapper for JDBC. It offers a more functional approach to database interaction, emphasizing immutability and simplicity.

```clojure
(require '[next.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec
  {:dbtype "h2" :dbname "test"})

;; Create a connection
(def ds (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec))

;; Execute a query
(jdbc/execute! ds ["CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50))"])

;; Insert data
(jdbc/execute! ds ["INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (?, ?)" 1 "Alice"])

;; Fetch data
(jdbc/execute! ds ["SELECT * FROM users"])
```

`next.jdbc` provides a more streamlined API, making it easier to work with databases in a functional style.

### Consuming and Producing Web Services

Web services are essential for enabling communication between applications over the internet. Clojure can consume and produce both RESTful and SOAP-based services.

#### Consuming RESTful Services

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for web services. Clojure can consume RESTful services using libraries like `clj-http`.

```clojure
(require '[clj-http.client :as client])

;; GET request
(def response (client/get "https://api.example.com/users"))

;; Parse JSON response
(def users (json/parse-string (:body response) true))
```

In this example, we use `clj-http` to send a GET request to a RESTful API and parse the JSON response.

#### Producing RESTful Services

Clojure can also produce RESTful services using libraries like Ring and Compojure.

```clojure
(require '[ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
         '[compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]])

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/users" [] "List of users"))

(run-jetty app-routes {:port 3000})
```

This code sets up a simple RESTful service that responds to GET requests at the `/users` endpoint.

#### Interacting with SOAP Services

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is another protocol for web services. Clojure can interact with SOAP services using libraries like `clj-soap`.

```clojure
(require '[clj-soap.core :as soap])

(def client (soap/client "http://example.com/soap?wsdl"))

;; Call a SOAP method
(soap/call client :GetUser {:id 1})
```

This example demonstrates how to create a SOAP client and call a method using `clj-soap`.

### Interacting with Message Queues

Message queues facilitate asynchronous communication between distributed systems. Clojure can interact with message queues using libraries like `clojurewerkz/machine_head` for MQTT or `langohr` for RabbitMQ.

#### Using RabbitMQ with Langohr

RabbitMQ is a popular message broker that supports various messaging protocols. `langohr` is a Clojure library for interacting with RabbitMQ.

```clojure
(require '[langohr.core :as rmq]
         '[langohr.channel :as lch]
         '[langohr.queue :as lq]
         '[langohr.basic :as lb])

(def conn (rmq/connect))
(def ch (lch/open conn))

;; Declare a queue
(lq/declare ch "test-queue")

;; Publish a message
(lb/publish ch "" "test-queue" "Hello, World!")

;; Consume messages
(lb/consume ch "test-queue" (fn [ch {:keys [delivery-tag]} ^bytes payload]
                              (println "Received:" (String. payload "UTF-8"))
                              (lb/ack ch delivery-tag)))
```

This example shows how to connect to RabbitMQ, declare a queue, publish a message, and consume messages using `langohr`.

### Best Practices for Resilience and Error Handling

When integrating with external systems, resilience and error handling are critical. Here are some best practices to consider:

- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for transient errors, such as network timeouts or temporary service unavailability.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Use the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when a service is down.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design your application to degrade gracefully when external systems are unavailable.
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for network requests to avoid hanging indefinitely.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and diagnose issues with external integrations.

### Visualizing Clojure's Integration with External Systems

To better understand how Clojure integrates with external systems, let's visualize the architecture using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ClojureApp
    participant Database
    participant RESTService
    participant MessageQueue

    ClojureApp->>Database: Connect and Query
    Database-->>ClojureApp: Return Data

    ClojureApp->>RESTService: Send HTTP Request
    RESTService-->>ClojureApp: Return Response

    ClojureApp->>MessageQueue: Publish Message
    MessageQueue-->>ClojureApp: Acknowledge Receipt
```

This diagram illustrates the interactions between a Clojure application and various external systems, including a database, a RESTful service, and a message queue.
