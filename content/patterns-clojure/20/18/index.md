## 20.18. Integrating WebAssembly (WASM) with ClojureScript

### Introduction to WebAssembly (WASM)

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust. It enables the execution of code at near-native speed in web browsers, providing a significant performance boost for web applications. WASM is supported by all major browsers, making it a powerful tool for developers looking to enhance the performance of their web applications.

#### The Role of WebAssembly in Web Development

WebAssembly was created to address the limitations of JavaScript in terms of performance, especially for compute-intensive tasks. While JavaScript is versatile and widely used, it can struggle with tasks that require heavy computation or real-time processing. WASM allows developers to write performance-critical code in languages that compile to WASM, which can then be executed alongside JavaScript in the browser.

### Compiling Performance-Critical Code to WASM

To leverage WASM, developers typically write code in a language that can be compiled to WASM. Popular choices include:

- **C/C++**: These languages are often used for their performance and control over system resources.
- **Rust**: Known for its safety and concurrency features, Rust is increasingly popular for WASM development.
- **AssemblyScript**: A TypeScript-like language that compiles to WASM, making it accessible for JavaScript developers.

#### Example: Compiling Rust to WASM

Let's explore how to compile a simple Rust function to WASM. First, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed, along with the `wasm-pack` tool.

```bash
# Install wasm-pack
cargo install wasm-pack
```

Create a new Rust library project:

```bash
cargo new --lib my_wasm_project
cd my_wasm_project
```

Edit the `Cargo.toml` to include the `wasm-bindgen` dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```

Write a simple Rust function in `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// This function will be exposed to JavaScript
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

Compile the Rust code to WASM:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

This command generates a `pkg` directory containing the WASM module and JavaScript bindings.

### Interacting with WASM Modules in ClojureScript

ClojureScript, being a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript, can interact with WASM modules using JavaScript interop. This allows ClojureScript applications to call functions defined in WASM modules, enabling performance-critical operations to be offloaded to WASM.

#### Loading and Using WASM in ClojureScript

To use a WASM module in ClojureScript, you typically load the module using JavaScript's `WebAssembly` API and then call the exported functions.

Here's how you can integrate the previously compiled Rust WASM module into a ClojureScript application:

1. **Include the WASM Module**: Ensure the `pkg` directory generated by `wasm-pack` is accessible to your ClojureScript application.

2. **Load the WASM Module**: Use JavaScript interop to load the WASM module.

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [cljs.js :as js]))

(defn load-wasm []
  (let [wasm-url "path/to/pkg/my_wasm_project_bg.wasm"]
    (-> (js/WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming (js/fetch wasm-url))
        (.then (fn [result]
                 (let [exports (.-exports (.-instance result))]
                   (println "WASM module loaded")
                   (println "Result of add(2, 3):" ((.-add exports) 2 3))))))))
```

3. **Call WASM Functions**: Once the module is loaded, you can call its functions using the exported object.

### Benefits of Integrating WASM with ClojureScript

Integrating WASM with ClojureScript offers several benefits:

- **Performance**: Offload compute-intensive tasks to WASM for faster execution.
- **Interoperability**: Use existing libraries and codebases written in languages like C/C++ and Rust.
- **Security**: WASM runs in a sandboxed environment, reducing security risks.
- **Portability**: WASM modules can run in any environment that supports WebAssembly, including browsers and Node.js.

### Example: A Practical Use Case

Consider a ClojureScript application that performs image processing. Image processing can be computationally expensive, making it a perfect candidate for WASM.

#### Rust Code for Image Processing

Let's write a simple Rust function to invert the colors of an image:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use image::{ImageBuffer, Rgba};

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn invert_colors(width: u32, height: u32, data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut img = ImageBuffer::<Rgba<u8>, _>::from_raw(width, height, data).unwrap();
    for pixel in img.pixels_mut() {
        let channels = pixel.0;
        pixel.0 = [255 - channels[0], 255 - channels[1], 255 - channels[2], channels[3]];
    }
    img.into_raw()
}
```

Compile this Rust code to WASM using `wasm-pack`.

#### ClojureScript Integration

In your ClojureScript application, load the WASM module and use the `invert_colors` function:

```clojure
(ns my-app.image
  (:require [cljs.js :as js]))

(defn invert-image [width height data]
  (let [wasm-url "path/to/pkg/my_wasm_project_bg.wasm"]
    (-> (js/WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming (js/fetch wasm-url))
        (.then (fn [result]
                 (let [exports (.-exports (.-instance result))
                       inverted-data ((.-invert_colors exports) width height data)]
                   (println "Image colors inverted")
                   inverted-data))))))
```

### Visualizing the Integration Process

To better understand the interaction between ClojureScript and WASM, let's visualize the process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ClojureScript
    participant JavaScript
    participant WASM

    ClojureScript->>JavaScript: Load WASM Module
    JavaScript->>WASM: Instantiate WASM
    WASM-->>JavaScript: Export Functions
    JavaScript-->>ClojureScript: Provide Exports
    ClojureScript->>JavaScript: Call WASM Function
    JavaScript->>WASM: Execute Function
    WASM-->>JavaScript: Return Result
    JavaScript-->>ClojureScript: Deliver Result
```

### Challenges and Considerations

While integrating WASM with ClojureScript can offer significant performance benefits, there are challenges to consider:

- **Debugging**: Debugging WASM can be more complex than JavaScript due to its binary nature.
- **Tooling**: Ensure you have the necessary tools and build systems in place to compile and manage WASM modules.
- **Interoperability**: Consider the overhead of data conversion between JavaScript and WASM.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided examples by modifying the Rust code to perform different image processing tasks, such as grayscale conversion or edge detection. Observe how the performance compares to a pure ClojureScript implementation.
