## 24.13. Common Mistakes with Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming and is widely used in Clojure. However, it can be a source of common pitfalls if not used correctly. In this section, we will explore how recursion works in Clojure, identify common mistakes, and provide best practices to avoid these pitfalls.

### Understanding Recursion in Clojure

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In Clojure, recursion is often used to process lists, trees, and other data structures. Clojure supports recursion through regular function calls and a special form called `recur`, which is used for tail recursion optimization.

#### How Recursion Works

When a function calls itself, it creates a new frame on the call stack for each call. This stack grows with each recursive call, which can lead to a stack overflow if the recursion is too deep. Tail recursion is a special form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function, allowing the stack frame to be reused.

### Common Mistakes with Recursion

#### 1. Missing `recur` for Tail Recursion

One of the most common mistakes is not using `recur` for tail-recursive functions. Without `recur`, each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, which can lead to a stack overflow.

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (dec n))))) ; Not tail-recursive

;; Corrected with recur
(defn factorial [n]
  (letfn [(fact [acc n]
            (if (<= n 1)
              acc
              (recur (* acc n) (dec n))))]
    (fact 1 n)))
```

In the corrected version, `recur` is used to ensure that the recursive call is in the tail position, allowing the stack frame to be reused.

#### 2. Inefficient Recursive Patterns

Another common mistake is using inefficient recursive patterns that do not take advantage of Clojure's strengths, such as lazy sequences and higher-order functions.

```clojure
(defn sum-list [lst]
  (if (empty? lst)
    0
    (+ (first lst) (sum-list (rest lst))))) ; Inefficient

;; Alternative using reduce
(defn sum-list [lst]
  (reduce + lst))
```

Using `reduce` is more efficient because it processes the list in a single pass without creating additional stack frames.

#### 3. Not Handling Base Cases Properly

Failing to handle base cases correctly can lead to infinite recursion and stack overflow errors.

```clojure
(defn countdown [n]
  (when (> n 0)
    (println n)
    (countdown (dec n)))) ; Missing base case for n = 0
```

Ensure that all base cases are covered to prevent infinite recursion.

#### 4. Overusing Recursion

While recursion is powerful, it is not always the best solution. Overusing recursion can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code. Consider using loops or higher-order functions when appropriate.

```clojure
;; Recursive approach
(defn find-max [lst]
  (if (empty? lst)
    nil
    (let [max-rest (find-max (rest lst))]
      (if (or (nil? max-rest) (> (first lst) max-rest))
        (first lst)
        max-rest))))

;; Using reduce
(defn find-max [lst]
  (reduce max lst))
```

### Alternatives to Recursion

#### 1. Using Loops

Clojure provides loop constructs that can be used as an alternative to recursion. The `loop` and `recur` combination allows for efficient iteration without the risk of stack overflow.

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (loop [acc 1, n n]
    (if (<= n 1)
      acc
      (recur (* acc n) (dec n)))))
```

#### 2. Leveraging Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` can often replace recursive solutions with more concise and efficient code.

```clojure
(defn even-numbers [lst]
  (filter even? lst))
```

### Visualizing Recursion

To better understand how recursion works, let's visualize the call stack for a simple recursive function.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Function Call] --> B[Recursive Call 1];
  B --> C[Recursive Call 2];
  C --> D[Base Case];
  D --> C;
  C --> B;
  B --> A;
```

This diagram illustrates how each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack until the base case is reached, at which point the stack unwinds.

### Best Practices for Recursion in Clojure

1. **Use `recur` for Tail Recursion**: Always use `recur` for tail-recursive functions to prevent stack overflow.
2. **Prefer Higher-Order Functions**: Use higher-order functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` for common operations.
3. **Handle Base Cases Carefully**: Ensure all base cases are covered to prevent infinite recursion.
4. **Avoid Overusing Recursion**: Consider alternatives like loops or higher-order functions for better readability and performance.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code examples to deepen your understanding of recursion in Clojure. Try modifying the base cases, using `recur`, and replacing recursion with higher-order functions.

```clojure
;; Recursive Fibonacci
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    n
    (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))

;; Tail-recursive Fibonacci
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (letfn [(fib [a b n]
            (if (zero? n)
              a
              (recur b (+ a b) (dec n))))]
    (fib 0 1 n)))

;; Using loop and recur
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (loop [a 0, b 1, n n]
    (if (zero? n)
      a
      (recur b (+ a b) (dec n)))))
```
