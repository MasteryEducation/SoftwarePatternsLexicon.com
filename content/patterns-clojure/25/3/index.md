## 25.3. Design Pattern Reference Cheat Sheet

Welcome to the Clojure Design Patterns Reference Cheat Sheet, a quick-reference guide summarizing the design patterns discussed in our comprehensive guide. This section is designed to provide you with a concise overview of each pattern, including its intent, structure, key points, and unique features in Clojure. Whether you're revisiting a pattern or exploring new ones, this cheat sheet will serve as a handy tool for quick recall and application.

### Creational Design Patterns

#### Factory Function Pattern

- **Intent**: Provide a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- **Structure**: Use functions to encapsulate the creation logic.
- **Key Participants**: Factory function, product.
- **Applicability**: Use when a system must be independent of how its objects are created.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (defn create-person [name age]
    {:name name :age age})
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Leverages Clojure's first-class functions and maps for flexible object creation.

#### Builder Pattern Using Functions and Maps

- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Structure**: Use functions to incrementally build a map.
- **Key Participants**: Builder function, product.
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to construct a complex object step-by-step.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (defn build-car [make model year]
    {:make make :model model :year year})
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Utilizes immutable data structures for safe and predictable object construction.

#### Singleton Pattern and Managing Global State

- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Structure**: Use atoms or refs to manage state.
- **Key Participants**: Singleton instance.
- **Applicability**: Use when exactly one instance of a class is needed.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (defonce instance (atom nil))
  (defn get-instance []
    (when (nil? @instance)
      (reset! instance (create-resource)))
    @instance)
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Atoms provide a thread-safe way to manage global state.

### Structural Design Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern Using Protocols

- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- **Structure**: Use protocols to define expected behavior.
- **Key Participants**: Adapter, adaptee, client.
- **Applicability**: Use to integrate classes with incompatible interfaces.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (defprotocol Shape
    (draw [this]))

  (defrecord Circle [radius]
    Shape
    (draw [this] (println "Drawing a circle with radius" radius)))
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Protocols provide a flexible way to define and implement interfaces.

#### Decorator Pattern with Function Wrapping

- **Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Structure**: Use higher-order functions to wrap behavior.
- **Key Participants**: Component, decorator.
- **Applicability**: Use to add behavior to individual objects.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (defn logging-decorator [f]
    (fn [& args]
      (println "Calling function with args" args)
      (apply f args)))
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Higher-order functions make it easy to compose and extend behavior.

### Behavioral Design Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern with Higher-Order Functions

- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- **Structure**: Use higher-order functions to pass algorithms.
- **Key Participants**: Strategy, context.
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to switch between different algorithms.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (defn execute-strategy [strategy x y]
    (strategy x y))

  (defn add [x y] (+ x y))
  (defn subtract [x y] (- x y))
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Functions as first-class citizens allow easy strategy swapping.

#### Observer Pattern Using Core.Async Channels

- **Intent**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- **Structure**: Use channels to broadcast changes.
- **Key Participants**: Subject, observer.
- **Applicability**: Use for event-driven systems.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (require '[clojure.core.async :as async])

  (defn create-observable []
    (let [ch (async/chan)]
      {:channel ch
       :notify (fn [msg] (async/>!! ch msg))}))

  (defn create-observer [observable]
    (async/go-loop []
      (when-let [msg (async/<! (:channel observable))]
        (println "Received update:" msg)
        (recur))))
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Core.async provides powerful tools for asynchronous programming.

### Concurrency and Parallelism Patterns

#### Software Transactional Memory (STM) with Refs

- **Intent**: Manage shared state with transactions.
- **Structure**: Use refs and transactions to ensure consistency.
- **Key Participants**: Refs, transactions.
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to manage complex state changes.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (def account (ref 100))

  (dosync
    (alter account + 50))
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: STM provides a robust model for managing concurrency.

#### Core.Async and Channels

- **Intent**: Facilitate asynchronous programming.
- **Structure**: Use channels to communicate between processes.
- **Key Participants**: Channels, go blocks.
- **Applicability**: Use for non-blocking I/O and concurrency.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (require '[clojure.core.async :as async])

  (defn producer [ch]
    (async/go
      (async/>! ch "Hello, World!")))

  (defn consumer [ch]
    (async/go
      (println "Received:" (async/<! ch))))
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Core.async channels simplify complex asynchronous workflows.

### Functional Programming Patterns

#### Immutability and Its Benefits

- **Intent**: Ensure data cannot be changed after creation.
- **Structure**: Use immutable data structures.
- **Key Participants**: Immutable collections.
- **Applicability**: Use to avoid side effects and improve concurrency.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (def my-map {:a 1 :b 2})
  (assoc my-map :c 3) ; Returns a new map
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Built-in immutable data structures enhance safety and predictability.

#### Higher-Order Functions and Function Composition

- **Intent**: Use functions as first-class citizens.
- **Structure**: Compose functions to build complex behavior.
- **Key Participants**: Functions, composition.
- **Applicability**: Use to build reusable and modular code.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:
  ```clojure
  (defn square [x] (* x x))
  (defn increment [x] (+ x 1))

  (def composed-fn (comp square increment))
  (composed-fn 2) ; Returns 9
  ```
- **Clojure Unique Features**: Clojure's `comp` function makes function composition straightforward.

### Visualizing Design Patterns

#### Factory Function Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class FactoryFunction {
        +createObject() Object
    }
    class Product {
        +operation()
    }
    FactoryFunction --> Product
```

#### Adapter Pattern Using Protocols

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    class Client {
        +doWork()
    }
    Adapter --> Adaptee
    Client --> Adapter
```

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use Patterns**: Consider the complexity and scalability of your application. Patterns can introduce overhead if used unnecessarily.
- **Clojure-Specific Features**: Leverage Clojure's functional programming paradigm, immutability, and concurrency models to implement patterns effectively.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoid overusing patterns, which can lead to unnecessary complexity. Ensure patterns align with the problem you're solving.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Factory vs. Builder**: Both are creational patterns, but Factory focuses on object creation, while Builder constructs complex objects step-by-step.
- **Adapter vs. Decorator**: Adapter changes an interface, while Decorator adds behavior.
