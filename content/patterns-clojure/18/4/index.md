## 18.4 Encryption and Decryption Patterns in Clojure

In today's digital landscape, securing sensitive information is paramount. Encryption and decryption are fundamental techniques used to protect data from unauthorized access. This article explores encryption and decryption patterns in Clojure, providing insights into symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, secure communication, and best practices.

### Fundamentals of Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format. Two primary types of encryption are symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is efficient and suitable for encrypting large amounts of data, such as data at rest in databases or files.

**Use Cases:**
- Encrypting files and databases.
- Securing data backups.

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is ideal for secure communication, such as transmitting sensitive data over the internet.

**Use Cases:**
- Secure email communication.
- Digital signatures for verifying authenticity.

### Symmetric Encryption Techniques

#### Implementing Symmetric Encryption

In Clojure, the `buddy-core` library provides robust tools for implementing symmetric encryption using the AES algorithm.

```clojure
(ns encryption-example
  (:require [buddy.core.crypto :as crypto]
            [buddy.core.codecs :as codecs]))

(def secret-key (crypto/generate-secret-key "AES" 256))

(defn encrypt-data [plaintext]
  (let [ciphertext (crypto/encrypt plaintext secret-key)]
    (codecs/bytes->hex ciphertext)))

(defn decrypt-data [ciphertext]
  (let [cipher-bytes (codecs/hex->bytes ciphertext)]
    (crypto/decrypt cipher-bytes secret-key)))
```

In this example, we generate a 256-bit AES key and use it to encrypt and decrypt data.

#### Key Management

Secure key management is crucial. Keys should never be hardcoded in the source code. Instead, use environment variables or dedicated key management services like AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault to store keys securely.

### Asymmetric Encryption Techniques

#### Public/Private Key Encryption

Asymmetric encryption in Clojure can be implemented using the `clojure.java.crypto` library for RSA encryption.

```clojure
(ns asymmetric-encryption
  (:require [clojure.java.crypto :as crypto]))

(defn generate-key-pair []
  (crypto/generate-key-pair "RSA" 2048))

(defn encrypt-with-public-key [public-key plaintext]
  (crypto/encrypt plaintext public-key))

(defn decrypt-with-private-key [private-key ciphertext]
  (crypto/decrypt ciphertext private-key))
```

This code demonstrates generating an RSA key pair and using it for encryption and decryption.

#### Digital Signatures

Digital signatures ensure data integrity and authenticity. Here's how to sign data and verify signatures:

```clojure
(defn sign-data [private-key data]
  (crypto/sign data private-key "SHA256withRSA"))

(defn verify-signature [public-key data signature]
  (crypto/verify data signature public-key "SHA256withRSA"))
```

### Hashing and Salting

#### Secure Hash Algorithms

Hashing is a one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters. Use `buddy-core` for secure hashing with SHA-256.

```clojure
(ns hashing-example
  (:require [buddy.core.hash :as hash]))

(defn hash-password [password]
  (hash/sha256 password))
```

#### Salting Passwords

Salting adds random data to passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks. `buddy-hashers` handles salting automatically.

```clojure
(ns salting-example
  (:require [buddy.hashers :as hashers]))

(defn hash-password-with-salt [password]
  (hashers/derive password))

(defn verify-password [password hash]
  (hashers/check password hash))
```

### Secure Communication

#### TLS/SSL Setup

Ensure all communication occurs over HTTPS. Configure HTTP clients and servers to enforce TLS, using libraries like `http-kit` or `aleph`.

#### Certificate Management

Proper SSL certificate management is essential. Regularly renew certificates and ensure they are issued by trusted authorities.

### Encryption Best Practices

#### Algorithm Selection

Always use industry-standard algorithms like AES and RSA. Avoid deprecated algorithms such as DES or MD5.

#### Key Lengths

Choose appropriate key sizes to ensure security. For AES, use at least 256 bits.

#### Avoiding Common Mistakes

- Do not invent custom encryption algorithms.
- Prefer GCM mode over ECB for AES encryption to ensure data integrity.

### Data Encryption at Rest

Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases and file systems. Consider both filesystem-level encryption and application-level encryption based on your security requirements.

### Compliance and Legal Considerations

Be aware of regulations like GDPR that mandate data encryption. Understand your obligations for data breach notifications if encrypted data is compromised.

### Example Implementations

Here's a complete example of encrypting, storing, and decrypting data:

```clojure
(defn store-encrypted-data [data]
  (let [encrypted (encrypt-data data)]
    ;; Store encrypted data in a database or file
    ))

(defn retrieve-and-decrypt-data []
  (let [encrypted-data ;; Retrieve encrypted data from storage
        ]
    (decrypt-data encrypted-data)))
```

### Testing and Verification

#### Automated Tests

Write tests to verify encryption and decryption processes, ensuring they work as expected.

```clojure
(ns encryption-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [encryption-example :refer :all]))

(deftest test-encryption-decryption
  (let [data "Sensitive Information"
        encrypted (encrypt-data data)
        decrypted (decrypt-data encrypted)]
    (is (= data decrypted))))
```

#### Regular Audits

Perform regular security reviews and audits of your encryption implementations to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
