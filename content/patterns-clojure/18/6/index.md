## 18.6. React Native Integration with Re-Natal and Expo

In this section, we will explore how to integrate ClojureScript with React Native using Re-Natal and Expo. This integration allows developers to leverage the power of ClojureScript's functional programming paradigm while building mobile applications with React Native's robust framework. We'll cover setup instructions, feature implementation, debugging techniques, and platform-specific considerations.

### Introduction to Re-Natal and Expo

**Re-Natal** is a tool that simplifies the process of creating React Native applications using ClojureScript. It provides a seamless way to work with React Native's ecosystem while taking advantage of ClojureScript's features like immutability and functional programming.

**Expo** is a framework and platform for universal React applications. It provides a set of tools and services that simplify the development and deployment of React Native apps. With Expo, you can build apps for both iOS and Android from the same codebase without needing to deal with native code.

### Setting Up Your Environment

To get started with Re-Natal and Expo, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth setup process:

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Yarn**: Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript. Install it by following the instructions on [Yarn's website](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- **Clojure and Leiningen**: Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and Leiningen is a build automation tool for Clojure. Install them by following the instructions on [Clojure's website](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).
- **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally by running the command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

#### Installing Re-Natal

1. **Install Re-Natal**: Use the following command to install Re-Natal globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g re-natal
   ```

2. **Create a New Project**: Create a new React Native project using Re-Natal:
   ```bash
   re-natal init MyApp
   ```

3. **Set Up Expo**: Navigate to your project directory and initialize Expo:
   ```bash
   cd MyApp
   expo init
   ```

### Implementing Features

Once your environment is set up, you can start implementing features in your mobile application. We'll cover navigation, state management, and asynchronous data fetching.

#### Navigation

React Navigation is a popular library for managing navigation in React Native apps. To use it with Re-Natal, follow these steps:

1. **Install React Navigation**: Add React Navigation to your project:
   ```bash
   yarn add @react-navigation/native
   yarn add @react-navigation/stack
   ```

2. **Configure Navigation**: Create a navigation stack in your `core.cljs` file:
   ```clojure
   (ns my-app.core
     (:require
       [reagent.core :as r]
       [reagent.react-native :as rn]
       [reagent-navigation.core :as nav]))

   (defn home-screen []
     [rn/view
      [rn/text "Welcome to the Home Screen"]])

   (defn details-screen []
     [rn/view
      [rn/text "Details Screen"]])

   (defn app []
     [nav/stack-navigator
      {:initial-route-name "Home"}
      [nav/screen {:name "Home" :component home-screen}]
      [nav/screen {:name "Details" :component details-screen}]])

   (defn init []
     (r/render [app] (.-body js/document)))
   ```

#### State Management

For state management, we can use Reagent, a ClojureScript interface to React. Reagent provides a simple way to manage state using atoms.

1. **Define State**: Create an atom to hold your application's state:
   ```clojure
   (def app-state (r/atom {:count 0}))
   ```

2. **Update State**: Create functions to update the state:
   ```clojure
   (defn increment []
     (swap! app-state update :count inc))

   (defn decrement []
     (swap! app-state update :count dec))
   ```

3. **Display State**: Use Reagent components to display and modify the state:
   ```clojure
   (defn counter []
     (let [count (:count @app-state)]
       [rn/view
        [rn/text (str "Count: " count)]
        [rn/button {:title "Increment" :on-press increment}]
        [rn/button {:title "Decrement" :on-press decrement}]]))
   ```

#### Asynchronous Data Fetching

Fetching data asynchronously is a common requirement in mobile applications. We can use ClojureScript's `cljs-http` library to make HTTP requests.

1. **Install cljs-http**: Add the library to your project:
   ```bash
   yarn add cljs-http
   ```

2. **Fetch Data**: Create a function to fetch data from an API:
   ```clojure
   (ns my-app.api
     (:require [cljs-http.client :as http]
               [cljs.core.async :refer [<!]]))

   (defn fetch-data []
     (go
       (let [response (<! (http/get "https://api.example.com/data"))]
         (println "Data fetched:" (:body response)))))
   ```

### Debugging Techniques and Tooling

Debugging is an essential part of the development process. Here are some techniques and tools to help you debug your ClojureScript and React Native applications:

#### Using React Native Debugger

React Native Debugger is a standalone app for debugging React Native applications. It provides a powerful set of tools for inspecting your app's state and performance.

1. **Install React Native Debugger**: Download and install it from [React Native Debugger's GitHub page](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger).

2. **Connect to Your App**: Open React Native Debugger and connect it to your running app by enabling remote debugging in the developer menu.

#### Debugging ClojureScript

ClojureScript provides several tools for debugging, including the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and Figwheel.

1. **Use the REPL**: Start a REPL session to interactively test and debug your code.

2. **Figwheel**: Use Figwheel to automatically reload your code as you make changes, providing instant feedback.

### Platform-Specific Considerations

When developing mobile applications, it's important to consider platform-specific differences. Here are some considerations for iOS and Android:

#### iOS Considerations

- **App Store Guidelines**: Ensure your app complies with Apple's App Store guidelines.
- **Push Notifications**: Implement push notifications using Apple's Push Notification Service (APNs).

#### Android Considerations

- **Google Play Policies**: Ensure your app complies with Google Play's policies.
- **Permissions**: Manage permissions carefully to provide a smooth user experience.
