## 18.3. Cross-Platform Development with ClojureScript and React Native

### Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of mobile application development, creating apps that work seamlessly across multiple platforms is a significant advantage. **React Native** has emerged as a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android devices, leveraging native components for performance and a native look and feel.

**ClojureScript**, a variant of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript, offers a functional programming paradigm that can be integrated with React Native. This integration is facilitated by tools like **Re-Natal** and **Expo**, which streamline the development process and enhance productivity.

In this section, we will explore how to harness the power of ClojureScript and React Native to build robust, cross-platform mobile applications. We will delve into the setup process, component creation, navigation, and the development workflow, including hot-reloading features.

### Understanding React Native

React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook. It allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Native bridges the gap between web and mobile development by enabling the use of React's declarative UI paradigm to create native mobile applications.

#### Key Features of React Native

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Write once, run on both iOS and Android.
- **Native Components**: Use native components for better performance and a native look.
- **Hot Reloading**: See changes instantly without recompiling the entire application.
- **Large Community and Ecosystem**: Access a vast array of libraries and tools.

For more information, visit the [React Native official website](https://reactnative.dev/).

### Integrating ClojureScript with React Native

ClojureScript brings the power of Clojure's functional programming to JavaScript environments. By integrating ClojureScript with React Native, developers can leverage immutable data structures, first-class functions, and a robust concurrency model in their mobile applications.

#### Re-Natal: Bridging ClojureScript and React Native

**Re-Natal** is a tool that simplifies the process of using ClojureScript with React Native. It provides a set of scripts and configurations to set up a ClojureScript-based React Native project quickly.

##### Setting Up Re-Natal

1. **Install Node.js and React Native CLI**: Ensure you have Node.js and the React Native CLI installed on your machine.

2. **Install Re-Natal**: Use npm to install Re-Natal globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g re-natal
   ```

3. **Initialize a New Project**: Create a new React Native project with Re-Natal:
   ```bash
   re-natal init MyApp
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: Launch the development server and open the app in a simulator or on a device:
   ```bash
   re-natal use-figwheel
   react-native run-ios
   ```

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Re-Natal GitHub repository](https://github.com/drapanjanas/re-natal).

### Building Components with ClojureScript

React Native applications are built using components. In ClojureScript, we can define components using functions and leverage React Native's component library.

#### Example: Creating a Simple Component

Let's create a simple "Hello World" component in ClojureScript:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [reagent.core :as r]))

(defn hello-world []
  [:> react-native/View
   [:> react-native/Text "Hello, World!"]])

(defn init []
  (r/render [hello-world]
            (.getElementById js/document "app")))
```

- **Reagent**: A minimalistic ClojureScript interface to React, used here to define components.
- **react-native/View** and **react-native/Text**: Native components provided by React Native.

### Navigation in React Native Apps

Navigation is a crucial aspect of mobile applications. React Native provides several libraries for navigation, with **React Navigation** being one of the most popular choices.

#### Setting Up React Navigation

1. **Install React Navigation**: Use npm to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install @react-navigation/native
   npm install @react-navigation/stack
   ```

2. **Configure Navigation**: Define a stack navigator in your ClojureScript code:

```clojure
(ns my-app.navigation
  (:require [reagent.core :as r]
            [reagent.react-native :as rn]
            ["@react-navigation/native" :refer [NavigationContainer]]
            ["@react-navigation/stack" :refer [createStackNavigator]]))

(def stack (createStackNavigator))

(defn home-screen []
  [:> rn/View
   [:> rn/Text "Home Screen"]])

(defn details-screen []
  [:> rn/View
   [:> rn/Text "Details Screen"]])

(defn app []
  [:> NavigationContainer
   [:> (.-Navigator stack)
    [:> (.-Screen stack) {:name "Home" :component home-screen}]
    [:> (.-Screen stack) {:name "Details" :component details-screen}]]])

(defn init []
  (r/render [app]
            (.getElementById js/document "app")))
```

- **NavigationContainer**: A container for managing navigation state.
- **createStackNavigator**: Creates a stack-based navigation system.

### Hot-Reloading and Development Workflow

One of the standout features of React Native is its hot-reloading capability, which allows developers to see changes instantly without restarting the application. This feature is supported in ClojureScript through tools like **Figwheel**.

#### Using Figwheel for Hot-Reloading

Figwheel is a ClojureScript tool that provides live code reloading. It enhances the development workflow by automatically reloading code changes in the browser or simulator.

1. **Configure Figwheel**: Ensure your `project.clj` is set up to use Figwheel.

2. **Start Figwheel**: Launch Figwheel alongside your React Native app:
   ```bash
   lein figwheel
   ```

3. **Make Changes and See Results**: Edit your ClojureScript code and see the changes reflected immediately in your app.

### Development Tools and Resources

- **Expo**: A framework and platform for universal React applications. It provides a set of tools and services for building, deploying, and testing React Native apps. Learn more at [Expo's official website](https://expo.dev/).
