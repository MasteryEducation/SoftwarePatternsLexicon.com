## 18.3 Input Validation and Sanitization in Clojure

In the realm of software security, input validation and sanitization are critical practices that help safeguard applications from a myriad of vulnerabilities. This section delves into the importance of these practices within the Clojure ecosystem, offering insights into techniques, libraries, and best practices to ensure robust and secure applications.

### Importance of Input Validation

Improper input handling is a common source of security vulnerabilities, including injection attacks, data corruption, and application crashes. By validating all external inputs—whether from users, APIs, or third-party services—developers can significantly reduce the risk of such vulnerabilities.

#### Key Points:
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unvalidated input can lead to severe security issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that only valid data enters the system, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
- **System Stability:** Prevents unexpected behavior and crashes by ensuring inputs conform to expected formats and types.

### Validation Techniques

Clojure offers several powerful tools and libraries for input validation, allowing developers to define precise validation rules and enforce them consistently.

#### Type Validation

Type validation ensures that inputs match expected data types, preventing type-related errors and vulnerabilities.

- **Clojure.spec:** A powerful library for defining specifications for data and functions. It allows for runtime validation, generative testing, and more.
  
  ```clojure
  (require '[clojure.spec.alpha :as s])

  (s/def ::email (s/and string? #(re-matches #".+@.+\..+" %)))

  (s/valid? ::email "example@example.com") ; => true
  (s/valid? ::email "invalid-email") ; => false
  ```

- **Malli:** An alternative to `clojure.spec`, offering a more data-driven approach to schema definitions and validation.

  ```clojure
  (require '[malli.core :as m])

  (def email-schema [:and string? [:re #".+@.+\..+"]])

  (m/validate email-schema "example@example.com") ; => true
  (m/validate email-schema "invalid-email") ; => false
  ```

#### Range and Format Checks

Validating numeric ranges, string lengths, and specific formats is crucial for ensuring data validity.

- **Numeric Ranges:** Use predicates to enforce numeric constraints.

  ```clojure
  (defn valid-age? [age]
    (and (integer? age) (<= 0 age 120)))

  (valid-age? 25) ; => true
  (valid-age? -5) ; => false
  ```

- **String Formats:** Regular expressions or custom validation functions can enforce specific string formats.

  ```clojure
  (defn valid-username? [username]
    (re-matches #"[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,16}" username))

  (valid-username? "user_123") ; => true
  (valid-username? "u!") ; => false
  ```

### Sanitization Methods

Sanitization involves cleaning input data to prevent malicious content from causing harm, particularly in contexts like HTML rendering or database queries.

#### Escaping Special Characters

Escaping special characters is essential to prevent injection attacks.

- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries to safely interact with databases.

  ```clojure
  (require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

  (defn get-user [db username]
    (jdbc/query db ["SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?" username]))
  ```

- **HTML Escaping:** Use libraries that automatically escape HTML to prevent XSS.

  ```clojure
  (require '[hiccup.core :refer [html]])

  (defn render-comment [comment]
    (html [:div.comment comment]))
  ```

#### Whitelist Approach

The whitelist approach allows only known good input values or patterns, rejecting anything that doesn't match the criteria.

- **Example:** Restricting input to a predefined set of values.

  ```clojure
  (def valid-countries #{"USA" "Canada" "UK"})

  (defn valid-country? [country]
    (contains? valid-countries country))

  (valid-country? "USA") ; => true
  (valid-country? "Mars") ; => false
  ```

### Preventing Common Attacks

By implementing robust validation and sanitization practices, developers can prevent common security attacks.

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Sanitize outputs when rendering user-provided content and use frameworks that auto-escape HTML.

- **Example:** Using Hiccup for HTML rendering, which escapes content by default.

  ```clojure
  (html [:div.comment (hiccup.util/escape-html user-input)])
  ```

#### SQL Injection

Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries to safely interact with databases, as shown in the previous example.

#### Command Injection

Avoid constructing shell commands with untrusted input and use safe APIs for system interactions.

- **Example:** Using `clojure.java.shell` for safe command execution.

  ```clojure
  (require '[clojure.java.shell :refer [sh]])

  (defn list-files [directory]
    (sh "ls" directory))
  ```

### Using Validation Libraries

Clojure provides several libraries to simplify the creation and enforcement of validation rules.

- **Struct:** A library for defining and validating data structures.
- **Valip:** Offers a collection of common validation functions.
- **Bouncer:** Provides a simple way to define and apply validation rules.

#### Example: Using Bouncer for Validation

```clojure
(require '[bouncer.core :as b]
         '[bouncer.validators :as v])

(defn validate-user [user]
  (b/validate user
              :username v/required
              :email [v/required v/email]
              :age [v/required (v/in-range 0 120)]))

(validate-user {:username "user123" :email "user@example.com" :age 25})
; => {:valid? true, :errors nil}

(validate-user {:username "" :email "invalid-email" :age 130})
; => {:valid? false, :errors {:username ["required"], :email ["email"], :age ["in-range"]}}
```

### Error Handling

When validation fails, it's crucial to handle errors gracefully, providing informative but secure error messages.

- **Avoid Exposing Details:** Do not expose stack traces or system details to end-users.
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Provide clear messages that guide users to correct their input without revealing internal logic.

### Logging Invalid Input Attempts

Keeping records of invalid input submissions can help identify potential attack patterns.

- **Log Analysis:** Regularly analyze logs to detect suspicious activities or repeated invalid attempts.
- **Security Monitoring:** Use logging as part of a broader security monitoring strategy.

### Best Practices

- **Consistent Validation:** Apply validation consistently across all input sources.
- **Layered Security:** Combine validation with other security measures like authentication and authorization.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep libraries and frameworks up-to-date to benefit from security patches and improvements.

### Conclusion

Input validation and sanitization are foundational practices for building secure and robust Clojure applications. By leveraging Clojure's powerful libraries and adhering to best practices, developers can effectively mitigate security risks and ensure data integrity.
