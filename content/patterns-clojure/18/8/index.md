- **Expo**: To streamline the development and deployment process.

#### Implementation Details
The application was structured around Re-frame's event-driven architecture, which allowed for a clear separation of concerns. The core components included:
- **Event Handlers**: To manage user interactions and application state changes.
- **Subscriptions**: For reactive data flow, ensuring that UI components automatically update in response to state changes.
- **Effects and Co-effects**: To handle side effects such as API calls and local storage access.

```clojure
(ns day8.core
  (:require [re-frame.core :as re-frame]))

;; Define an event handler
(re-frame/reg-event-db
 :initialize-db
 (fn [_ _]
   {:counter 0}))

;; Define a subscription
(re-frame/reg-sub
 :counter
 (fn [db _]
   (:counter db)))

;; Define a component
(defn counter-component []
  (let [counter (re-frame/subscribe [:counter])]
    [:div
     [:h1 "Counter: " @counter]
     [:button {:on-click #(re-frame/dispatch [:increment-counter])} "Increment"]]))
```

#### Successes and Challenges
The use of Re-frame allowed Day8 to build a highly maintainable and scalable application. The reactive data flow ensured that the UI remained consistent with the application state, reducing bugs and improving user satisfaction. However, the team faced challenges with integrating native modules in React Native, which required custom bridging code.

#### Lessons Learned
- **Leverage Re-frame's architecture**: The separation of concerns and reactive data flow are powerful tools for building complex applications.
- **Plan for native integration**: Anticipate the need for custom native modules and plan accordingly.

### Case Study 2: Metabase Mobile

- **UI Components**: Built with Reagent, leveraging React Native's component library for a native look and feel.
- **State Management**: Using Re-frame to manage application state and synchronize it with the server.

```clojure
(ns metabase.mobile
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent]
            [re-frame.core :as re-frame]))

;; Define a component for displaying a dashboard
(defn dashboard-component [dashboard-id]
  (let [dashboard (re-frame/subscribe [:get-dashboard dashboard-id])]
    (fn []
      [:div
       [:h1 (:title @dashboard)]
       [:div (:content @dashboard)]])))
```

#### Successes and Challenges
The Metabase team successfully delivered a mobile app that extended the functionality of their web platform. The use of ClojureScript allowed for code reuse and consistency across platforms. However, optimizing performance for mobile devices required significant effort, particularly in managing large datasets.

#### Lessons Learned
- **Optimize for mobile performance**: Pay attention to data fetching and rendering performance to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Reuse code where possible**: ClojureScript's interoperability with JavaScript allows for significant code reuse between web and mobile applications.

### Case Study 3: CircleCI Mobile

#### Project Goals
CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform, aimed to provide its users with a mobile application to monitor and manage their builds and deployments. The goal was to create a responsive and intuitive interface using ClojureScript.

#### Technical Stack
- **ClojureScript**: For application logic and state management.
- **Re-frame**: To handle application state and side effects.
- **React Native**: For building the mobile user interface.
- **GraphQL**: For efficient data querying and manipulation.

#### Implementation Details
The CircleCI mobile app was built with a focus on real-time updates and user interaction. Key features included:
- **Real-time Notifications**: Using GraphQL subscriptions to provide users with instant updates on build status.
- **User Interface**: Built with React Native components, styled for a consistent look and feel.
- **State Management**: Managed with Re-frame, ensuring a responsive and consistent user experience.

```clojure
(ns circleci.mobile
  (:require [re-frame.core :as re-frame]
            [reagent.core :as reagent]))

;; Define a component for displaying build status
(defn build-status-component [build-id]
  (let [build-status (re-frame/subscribe [:get-build-status build-id])]
    (fn []
      [:div
       [:h2 "Build Status"]
       [:p (:status @build-status)]])))
```

#### Successes and Challenges
The CircleCI mobile app successfully provided users with a powerful tool for managing their CI/CD pipelines on the go. The use of GraphQL allowed for efficient data fetching and real-time updates. However, integrating GraphQL with Re-frame required custom solutions to handle subscriptions and mutations.
