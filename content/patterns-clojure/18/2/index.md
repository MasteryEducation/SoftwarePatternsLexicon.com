## 18.2 Authentication and Authorization Patterns in Clojure

In today's digital landscape, securing applications is paramount. Authentication and authorization are two critical components that ensure only legitimate users gain access to resources. This article delves into various authentication and authorization patterns in Clojure, providing insights and practical examples to help you secure your applications effectively.

### Understanding Authentication vs. Authorization

Before diving into specific patterns, it's essential to distinguish between authentication and authorization:

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?" Common methods include passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication.
- **Authorization** determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What can you do?" This involves checking permissions and roles to grant or deny access to resources.

Both processes are crucial for securing applications, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

### Authentication Methods

#### Password-Based Authentication

Handling passwords securely is a fundamental aspect of authentication. Clojure provides robust libraries to facilitate this process.

- **Password Hashing with bcrypt:**

  Passwords should never be stored in plain text. Instead, use hashing algorithms like bcrypt to securely hash passwords. The `buddy-hashers` library in Clojure is a popular choice for this purpose.

  ```clojure
  (ns myapp.auth
    (:require [buddy.hashers :as hashers]))

  ;; Hashing a password
  (def hashed-password (hashers/derive "my-secret-password"))

  ;; Verifying a password
  (defn verify-password [input-password stored-hash]
    (hashers/check input-password stored-hash))
  ```

  This approach ensures that even if the database is compromised, the actual passwords remain secure.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**

  MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification steps. This can include one-time passwords (OTPs) sent via SMS or email, or using external services like Google Authenticator.

  ```clojure
  ;; Example of integrating MFA using a hypothetical library
  (defn send-otp [user]
    ;; Logic to send OTP to the user
    )

  (defn verify-otp [user input-otp]
    ;; Logic to verify the OTP
    )
  ```

  Integrating MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.

- **OAuth2 and OpenID Connect:**

  These protocols allow users to authenticate using third-party providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub. Libraries such as `friend` or `ring-oauth2` simplify the implementation of social login in Clojure applications.

  ```clojure
  (ns myapp.oauth
    (:require [ring-oauth2.core :as oauth2]))

  ;; Configuration for OAuth2
  (def config
    {:client-id "your-client-id"
     :client-secret "your-client-secret"
     :redirect-uri "http://yourapp.com/callback"
     :authorization-uri "https://provider.com/oauth2/auth"
     :token-uri "https://provider.com/oauth2/token"})

  ;; Middleware for handling OAuth2
  (defn oauth2-middleware [handler]
    (oauth2/wrap-oauth2 handler config))
  ```

  This method offloads the authentication process to trusted providers, enhancing security and user convenience.

### Authorization Strategies

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is a widely used strategy where permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to these roles. This simplifies permission management and enhances security.

- **Defining Roles and Permissions:**

  ```clojure
  (def roles
    {:admin #{:read :write :delete}
     :user #{:read}})

  (defn has-permission? [user-role permission]
    (contains? (get roles user-role) permission))
  ```

  By defining roles and their associated permissions, you can easily enforce access control based on user roles.

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC uses user attributes and policies to make dynamic authorization decisions. This approach offers more flexibility than RBAC.

- **Implementing ABAC:**

  ```clojure
  (defn abac-policy [user resource action]
    ;; Define policies based on user attributes and resource properties
    (and (= (:department user) (:department resource))
         (contains? (:allowed-actions resource) action)))

  (defn authorize [user resource action]
    (abac-policy user resource action))
  ```

  ABAC allows for fine-grained control, considering various attributes and conditions.

#### Permission-Based Access Control

This strategy involves assigning specific permissions to users or roles, providing fine-grained control over access.

- **Assigning Permissions:**

  ```clojure
  (def user-permissions
    {:alice #{:read :write}
     :bob #{:read}})

  (defn can-access? [user permission]
    (contains? (get user-permissions user) permission))
  ```

  Permission-based access control is ideal for applications requiring detailed access management.

### Implementing Middleware for Security

Middleware plays a crucial role in integrating authentication and authorization checks in web applications. Using Ring middleware, you can protect routes and resources effectively.

```clojure
(ns myapp.middleware
  (:require [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]
            [myapp.auth :refer [verify-password]]
            [myapp.oauth :refer [oauth2-middleware]]))

(defn wrap-authentication [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [user (get-in request [:session :user])]
      (if user
        (handler request)
        {:status 401 :body "Unauthorized"}))))

(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-authentication
      oauth2-middleware
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))
```

This setup ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes, enhancing the application's security posture.

### Session Management

Managing user sessions securely is vital for maintaining user state and preventing unauthorized access.

- **Stateful Sessions vs. Stateless Tokens:**

  Stateful sessions store user data on the server, while stateless tokens (e.g., JWTs) store user data in the token itself. Each approach has its pros and cons.

  - **Stateful Sessions:**

    ```clojure
    ;; Example of managing stateful sessions
    (defn login [user]
      ;; Store user data in session
      )

    (defn logout [session]
      ;; Invalidate session
      )
    ```

  - **Stateless Tokens:**

    ```clojure
    ;; Example of using JWTs
    (defn generate-token [user]
      ;; Create JWT token
      )

    (defn verify-token [token]
      ;; Verify JWT token
      )
    ```

  Stateless tokens are more scalable, especially in distributed systems, but require careful handling to ensure security.

### Password Security Best Practices

Ensuring password security is crucial for protecting user accounts. Here are some best practices:

- Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt with salt to hash passwords.
- Enforce password complexity and rotation policies to encourage strong passwords.
- Regularly audit and update password handling mechanisms to address emerging threats.

### Error Handling and User Feedback

Proper error handling and user feedback are essential for maintaining security and user experience.

- **Generic Error Messages:**

  Avoid leaking sensitive information through error messages. Provide generic messages for authentication failures.

  ```clojure
  (defn handle-login-error []
    {:status 401 :body "Invalid credentials"})
  ```

- **Graceful Handling of Access Denials:**

  Ensure that access denials are handled gracefully, providing users with clear instructions on how to proceed.

### Logging and Monitoring

Logging and monitoring are critical for detecting and responding to security incidents.

- **Log Authentication Attempts:**

  Track successful and failed authentication attempts to identify potential security threats.

  ```clojure
  (defn log-authentication [user success?]
    ;; Log authentication attempt
    )
  ```

- **Set Up Alerts for Suspicious Activities:**

  Implement alerts for activities like brute-force attacks to enable timely responses.

### Conclusion

Authentication and authorization are foundational to application security. By implementing robust patterns and best practices in Clojure, you can protect your applications from unauthorized access and ensure a secure user experience. From password hashing to OAuth2 integration, and from RBAC to ABAC, Clojure offers powerful tools and libraries to enhance your security posture.
