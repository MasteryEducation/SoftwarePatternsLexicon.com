## Definition
The Competing Consumers pattern enables multiple consumers to concurrently process messages from the same message queue, thereby sharing the load and increasing throughput.

## Intent
The primary goal is to improve scalability and ensure that messages are processed efficiently by distributing them among a set of consumers.

## Also Known As
- Concurrent Consumers

## Detailed Definitions and Explanations
In the Competing Consumers pattern, multiple instances of a consumer application retrieve and process messages from a single message queue. The messages are distributed among these consumer instances, which process the messages concurrently, enhancing scalability.

```mermaid
graph TB
    MQ[Message Queue] --> |Message 1| C1[Consumer 1]
    MQ[Message Queue] --> |Message 2| C2[Consumer 2]
    MQ[Message Queue] --> |Message 3| C3[Consumer 3]

    subgraph Server Cluster
        C1[Consumer 1]
        C2[Consumer 2]
        C3[Consumer 3]
    end
```

## Key Features
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes workload efficiently among available consumer instances.
- **Fault Tolerance:** If one consumer fails, messages can still be processed by other consumers.
- **Scalability:** Increases processing throughput by adding more consumer instances.

## Code Examples

### Java using Spring Boot and Apache Kafka
```java
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MessageConsumer {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group")
    public void listen(String message) {
        System.out.println("Consumed message: " + message);
        // Process the message
    }
}
```

### Scala using Akka Streams and Apache Kafka
```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.kafka.ConsumerSettings
import akka.kafka.scaladsl.Consumer
import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer

implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("example")
implicit val materializer: ActorMaterializer = ActorMaterializer()

val consumerSettings = ConsumerSettings(system, new StringDeserializer, new StringDeserializer)
  .withBootstrapServers("localhost:9092")
  .withGroupId("my-group")

val source = Consumer.plainSource(consumerSettings, Subscriptions.topics("my-topic"))

source.runForeach { record => 
  println(s"Consumed message: ${record.value}")
  // Process the message
}
```

## Example Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class MessageQueue {
        +List<String> messages
        +sendMessage(String message)
        +String receiveMessage()
    }

    class Consumer {
        +void listen(String message)
    }

    MessageQueue o-- Consumer
```

## Example Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant MQ as Message Queue
    participant C1 as Consumer 1
    participant C2 as Consumer 2
    participant C3 as Consumer 3

    Producer->>+MQ: sendMessage("message 1")
    MQ->>+C1: receiveMessage()
    C1->>C1: processMessage("message 1")

    Producer->>+MQ: sendMessage("message 2")
    MQ->>+C2: receiveMessage()
    C2->>C2: processMessage("message 2")

    Producer->>+MQ: sendMessage("message 3")
    MQ->>+C3: receiveMessage()
    C3->>C3: processMessage("message 3")
```

## Benefits
- **Improved Throughput:** More messages can be processed in parallel.
- **Resilience:** System continues functioning even if some consumers fail.
- **Scalability:** Easily scaled by adding more consumers.

## Trade-offs
- **Consistency Issues:** Could lead to processing races or out-of-order messages.
- **Higher Complexity:** Requires managing and orchestrating multiple consumers.

## When to Use
- When processing a high volume of messages needing concurrent processing.
- When system throughput needs to be increased without deploying more producers.

## Example Use Cases
- Microservices architectures for processing distributed messages.
- Log processing systems where logs must be processed in real-time.

## When Not to Use and Anti-patterns
- When strict message ordering is required, as consumers process messages out of order.
- When the overhead of managing multiple consumers outweighs the benefits.

## Related Design Patterns
### Message Queue
Manages the delivery of messages and ensures they reach the consumer correctly.

### Publish/Subscribe
Consumers subscribe to messages and are notified when messages are available, but they do not compete for messages.

### Guidance:
To address high-throughput processing, combining the *Message Queue* pattern with *Competing Consumers* and possibly a *Publish/Subscribe* model offers a robust solution. Utilizing frameworks like **Apache Kafka** can assist in implementing these patterns effectively.
