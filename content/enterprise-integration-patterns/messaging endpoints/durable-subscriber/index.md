## Definition

A **Durable Subscriber** is a type of message consumer that keeps track of messages published while the subscriber is inactive. Once the subscriber reconnects, it receives all missed messages, ensuring no data loss.

## Intent

The primary intent of the **Durable Subscriber** pattern is to provide reliability and guarantee message delivery to subscribers even if they are temporarily unavailable.

## Also Known As

- Persistent Subscriber
- Reliable Subscriber

## Detailed Explanation

### Key Features

- **Message Persistence**: Messages are stored and not discarded until they are consumed.
- **Guaranteed Delivery**: Ensures no messages are missed.
- **Resilience**: Supports fault tolerance by allowing subscribers to recover from downtime.

### Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Publisher --> MessagingBroker
    MessagingBroker --> Subscriber : Delivers Messages
    class Publisher {
        +sendMessage(message: Message)
    }
    class MessagingBroker {
        +registerSubscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)
        +storeMessage(message: Message)
        +deliverMessages(subscriber: Subscriber)
    }
    class Subscriber {
        +subscribe(broker: MessagingBroker)
        +receive(message: Message)
    }
```
**Explanation**: The diagram represents the flow where the Publisher sends messages to the MessagingBroker, which then stores and delivers messages to the Subscriber.

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Publisher
    participant MessagingBroker
    participant Subscriber

    Publisher ->> MessagingBroker: Publishes message
    alt Subscriber is active
        MessagingBroker ->> Subscriber: Delivers message
    else Subscriber is inactive
        MessagingBroker ->> MessagingBroker: Stores message
    end
    Subscriber ->> MessagingBroker: Subscribes to receive messages
    MessagingBroker ->> Subscriber: Delivers stored messages
```

**Explanation**: The sequence shows how the broker handles message delivery differently based on the subscriber's availability.

### Code Example in Java

```java
import org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory;
import javax.jms.*;

public class DurableSubscriberExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws JMSException {
        String url = "tcp://localhost:61616";
        ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(url);
        Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
        connection.setClientID("durable_subscriber");
        Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
        Topic topic = session.createTopic("messageTopic");

        MessageConsumer consumer = session.createDurableSubscriber(topic, "durable_subscriber");
        connection.start();

        while (true) {
            Message message = consumer.receive();
            if (message instanceof TextMessage) {
                TextMessage textMessage = (TextMessage) message;
                System.out.println("Received: " + textMessage.getText());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Code Example in Scala

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.kafka.{ConsumerSettings, Subscriptions}
import akka.kafka.scaladsl.Consumer
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
import akka.stream.scaladsl.Sink

object DurableSubscriberExample extends App {
  implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("DurableSubscriberExample")

  val consumerSettings = ConsumerSettings(system, new StringDeserializer, new StringDeserializer)
    .withBootstrapServers("localhost:9092")
    .withGroupId("durable_subscriber_group")

  Consumer.plainSource(consumerSettings, Subscriptions.topics("messageTopic"))
    .runWith(Sink.foreach(record => println(s"Received: ${record.value}")))
}
```

### Benefits

- **Reliability**: Ensures no messages are lost due to subscriber downtime.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supports recovery and continued message processing after failures.
- **Consistency**: Ensures message order and consistency.

### Trade-offs

- **Storage Overhead**: Requires additional storage to persist messages.
- **Complexity**: More complex implementation compared to non-durable subscribers.
- **Resource Consumption**: Can consume more CPU and memory resources.

### When to Use

- When order and delivery of messages are critical.
- When there is a risk of subscriber downtime.
- In systems where message loss is unacceptable.

### Example Use Cases

- Financial transactions.
- Order processing systems.
- Real-time data feeds (e.g., stock trading).

### When Not to Use and Anti-Patterns

- When the order of messages is non-critical.
- In resource-constrained environments where storage overhead is too high.
