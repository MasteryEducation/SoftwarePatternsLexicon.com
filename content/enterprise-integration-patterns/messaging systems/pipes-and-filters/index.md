The **Pipes and Filters** pattern enables complex processing by dividing the overall process into a series of independent steps (filters) connected by channels (pipes). Each filter performs a specific transformation, enhancing flexibility and reusability.

## Intent

To structure the processing of complex tasks by breaking them down into sequences of independent filters connected by pipes, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

## Usages

**Also Known As**: Data Flow Architecture

## Key Features

- **Modularity**: Separate processing into independent stages.
- **Reusability**: Use filters across different contexts.
- **Scalability**: Add or remove filters to adjust the pipeline.
- **Maintainability**: Change individual filters without affecting others.

## Detailed Explanation

A filter processes the incoming message, performs a specific task, and produces an output. Multiple filters connected by pipes form a pipeline, facilitating complex data processing.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Message Source] -->|Pipe| B[Filter 1]
    B -->|Pipe| C[Filter 2]
    C -->|Pipe| D[Filter 3]
    D -->|Pipe| E[Message Sink]
```

### Code Examples

#### Java with Apache Camel

```java
import org.apache.camel.CamelContext;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultCamelContext;

public class PipesAndFiltersExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
        context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() {
                from("file:input")
                  .to("file:filter1")
                  .to("file:filter2")
                  .to("file:output");
            }
        });

        context.start();
        Thread.sleep(10000);
        context.stop();
    }
}
```

#### Scala with Akka Streams

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{Flow, Sink, Source}

object PipesAndFiltersApp extends App {
  implicit val system = ActorSystem("PipesAndFiltersSystem")
  implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()

  val source = Source(List("message1", "message2"))
  val filter1 = Flow[String].map(msg => s"filter1: $msg")
  val filter2 = Flow[String].map(msg => s"filter2: $msg")
  val sink = Sink.foreach[String](println)

  val stream = source.via(filter1).via(filter2).to(sink)
  stream.run()
}
```

## Example Class and Sequence Diagrams

### Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Pipe {
        <<Interface>>
    }
    class Filter {
        <<Interface>>
        + process(message: Message): Message
    }
    class FilterA {
        + process(message: Message): Message
    }
    class FilterB {
        + process(message: Message): Message
    }
    class Message {
        - content: String
        + getContent(): String
        + setContent(content: String): void
    }

    Pipe <|.. Filter
    Filter <|-- FilterA
    Filter <|-- FilterB
    FilterA "1" --> "1..*" Message
    FilterB "1" --> "1..*" Message
```

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Participant Source
    Participant Filter1
    Participant Filter2
    Participant Sink

    Source ->> Filter1: Message
    Filter1 ->> Filter2: Transformed Message
    Filter2 ->> Sink: Further Transformed Message
```

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Easily add, remove, or rearrange filters.
- **Modularity**: Each filter has a single responsibility.
- **Flexibility**: Different pipelines can share filters.

## Trade-offs

- **Latency**: Increased processing time due to multiple stages.
- **Complexity in Orchestration**: Managing the sequence and state of filters.

## When to Use

- Complex data processing requiring multiple steps.
- Stream processing where data flows through independent transformations.
- Scenarios requiring modular and reusable processing components.

## Example Use Cases

- **ETL Pipelines**: Transform, filter, and load data in stages.
- **Image Processing**: Apply a series of transformations to process images.
- **Log Aggregation**: Collect, filter, and analyze log data from various sources.

## When Not to Use and Anti-patterns

- Simple tasks solvable with a single processing step (adds unnecessary complexity).
- Too fine-grained filters causing splitting of simple transformations (increased orchestration complexity).

## Related Design Patterns

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Similar but passes control to the next handler dynamically.
- **Mediator**: Manages the interaction between several objects by introducing a mediator.
- **Message Router**: Routes the message to different endpoints based on specific conditions.
