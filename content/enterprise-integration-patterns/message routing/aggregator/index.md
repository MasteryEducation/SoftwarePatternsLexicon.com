## Aggregator Pattern

The Aggregator pattern handles combining the results of individual, but related messages to process them as a whole.

### Intent

The intent of the Aggregator pattern is to collect and combine related messages, process them as a single entity, and produce an aggregated result. This pattern is often used when you need to combine pieces of data into a single composite message to forward to the next processing stage.

### Also Known As

- Combine
- Collector

### Detailed Definitions and Explanations

The Aggregator is a stateful filter that receives a stream of related but partially processed messages. It maintains a state to collect and store these messages until a condition is met (e.g., receiving all expected messages), then it compiles the messages into a single, composite message.


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Message 1] --> B[Aggregrator]
    A2[Input Message 2] --> B[Aggregrator]
    A3[Input Message 3] --> B[Aggregrator]
    B --> C[Aggregated Output Message]
```

### Key Features

1. **Stateful Message Handling**: Maintains state to collect and store incoming messages.
2. **Condition-based Aggregation**: Triggers aggregation based on specific conditions (e.g., message count, time window).
3. **Composite Message Creation**: Produces a single message from a collection of related messages.

### Code Examples

#### Java Example with Apache Camel

```java
public class AggregatorRoute extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("direct:input")
            .aggregate(header("groupId"), new GroupedBodyAggregationStrategy())
            .completionSize(3)
            .to("mock:output");
    }
}

class GroupedBodyAggregationStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {
    @Override
    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {
        if (oldExchange == null) {
            return newExchange;
        }
        String oldBody = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        String newBody = newExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        oldExchange.getIn().setBody(oldBody + " + " + newBody);
        return oldExchange;
    }
}
```

#### Scala Example with Akka Streams

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
import akka.stream.scaladsl._

object AggregatorExample extends App {
  implicit val system = ActorSystem("AggregatorSystem")
  implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()

  val input = Source(List(
    (1, "first"),
    (1, "second"),
    (1, "third")
  ))

  input
    .groupBy(100, _._1)
    .fold(("", Seq.empty[String])) {
      case ((_, acc), (_, value)) => ("group", acc :+ value)
    }
    .mergeSubstreams
    .map { case (_, combined) => combined.mkString(" + ") }
    .runForeach(println)

  system.terminate()
}
```

### Example Class Diagrams

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Aggregator {
        +Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange)
    }

    class GroupedBodyAggregationStrategy {
        +Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange)
    }

    Aggregator <|-- GroupedBodyAggregationStrategy
```

### Example Sequence Diagrams

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Source
    participant Aggregator
    participant Output

    Source->>+Aggregator: Message 1
    Source->>+Aggregator: Message 2
    Source->>+Aggregator: Message 3
    Aggregator-->>-Output: Aggregated Message
```

### Benefits

- Efficient message processing.
- Simplifies downstream processing by reducing the number of messages.
- Increases data consistency by grouping related data.

### Trade-offs

- Increased complexity in maintaining state.
- Potential performance bottlenecks if aggregation conditions are too stringent.
- Additional memory usage for storing intermediary messages.

### When to Use

- When multiple related messages need to be processed together.
- To ensure data consistency from multiple inputs.
- In event-driven architectures that need stateful message processing.

### Example Use Cases

- Combining sensor readings for a period of time.
- Collecting user actions for batch processing.
- Aggregating order items before payment processing.

### When Not to Use and Anti-patterns

- For single, independent messages that do not need combination.
- Instead of transforming or routing messages (use Transformer or Router patterns for those tasks).

### Related Design Patterns

- **Splitter**: The opposite of Aggregator, used to split a message into multiple parts.
- **Filter**: Can be used in conjunction to filter out non-relevant messages before aggregation.

### Grouped Patterns for Data Processing

You can utilize different patterns in combination for addressing specific application's needs, such as:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Filter] --> B[Splitter]
    B --> C[Aggregator]
    C --> D[Composed Message]
```

**Filter** can remove irrelevant data before sending it to **Splitter** that divides data into manageable pieces, which **Aggregator** then combines into a **Composed Message**.
