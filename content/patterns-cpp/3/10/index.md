## 3.10 Templates, Metaprogramming, and SFINAE

Welcome to the fascinating world of C++ templates, metaprogramming, and SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error). In this section, we'll delve deep into these advanced topics, which are essential for crafting efficient, reusable, and flexible code. Whether you're building complex libraries or optimizing performance-critical applications, mastering these concepts will elevate your C++ programming skills to new heights.

### Understanding C++ Templates

Templates are a powerful feature of C++ that allow you to write generic and reusable code. They enable the creation of functions and classes that work with any data type, providing a foundation for generic programming.

#### Function Templates

Function templates allow you to define a function without specifying the exact data types. The compiler generates the appropriate function based on the types of arguments passed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function template to find the maximum of two values
template <typename T>
T max(T a, T b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Max of 3 and 7: " << max(3, 7) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Max of 3.5 and 2.1: " << max(3.5, 2.1) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `max` function template works with both integers and floating-point numbers. The compiler generates the appropriate version of the function based on the argument types.

#### Class Templates

Class templates allow you to create classes that can handle any data type. This is particularly useful for creating container classes like vectors, stacks, and queues.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Class template for a simple pair
template <typename T1, typename T2>
class Pair {
public:
    T1 first;
    T2 second;
    
    Pair(T1 f, T2 s) : first(f), second(s) {}
    
    void display() const {
        std::cout << "Pair: (" << first << ", " << second << ")" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Pair<int, double> p(42, 3.14);
    p.display();
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `Pair` class template can hold any two types of data, demonstrating the flexibility of class templates.

### Template Metaprogramming Basics

Template metaprogramming is a technique that uses templates to perform computations at compile time. This can lead to more efficient code by reducing runtime overhead.

#### Compile-Time Factorial

Let's explore a simple example of template metaprogramming by calculating the factorial of a number at compile time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Template metaprogramming to calculate factorial
template <int N>
struct Factorial {
    static const int value = N * Factorial<N - 1>::value;
};

// Base case specialization
template <>
struct Factorial<0> {
    static const int value = 1;
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5: " << Factorial<5>::value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Factorial` struct template recursively calculates the factorial of a number at compile time. The base case specialization for `Factorial<0>` ensures that the recursion terminates.

### Using SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)

SFINAE is a powerful feature of C++ templates that allows you to enable or disable template instantiations based on certain conditions. This is particularly useful for creating generic algorithms that work with a wide range of types.

#### SFINAE with Function Overloading

Let's see how SFINAE can be used to conditionally enable function overloads based on type traits.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

// Function to handle integral types
template <typename T>
typename std::enable_if<std::is_integral<T>::value, void>::type
process(T value) {
    std::cout << "Processing integral type: " << value << std::endl;
}

// Function to handle floating-point types
template <typename T>
typename std::enable_if<std::is_floating_point<T>::value, void>::type
process(T value) {
    std::cout << "Processing floating-point type: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    process(42);        // Calls the integral version
    process(3.14);      // Calls the floating-point version
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::enable_if` to conditionally enable different versions of the `process` function based on whether the type is integral or floating-point.

### Implementing Generic Algorithms with Templates

Templates allow you to implement algorithms that work with any data type, making your code more flexible and reusable.

#### Generic Sorting Algorithm

Let's implement a simple generic sorting algorithm using templates.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Function template for bubble sort
template <typename T>
void bubbleSort(std::vector<T>& arr) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; ++i) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < arr.size() - i - 1; ++j) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                std::swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6};
    bubbleSort(numbers);
    for (int num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a generic bubble sort algorithm that can sort vectors of any data type.

### `std::enable_if` and Type Traits

`std::enable_if` is a utility that allows you to conditionally enable template instantiations based on compile-time conditions. Combined with type traits, it provides a powerful mechanism for creating flexible and type-safe code.

#### Using `std::enable_if` with Type Traits

Let's explore how `std::enable_if` can be used with type traits to create a function that only accepts certain types.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

// Function template that only accepts arithmetic types
template <typename T>
typename std::enable_if<std::is_arithmetic<T>::value, T>::type
add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Sum of 3 and 4: " << add(3, 4) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Sum of 3.5 and 2.5: " << add(3.5, 2.5) << std::endl;
    // add("Hello", "World"); // This line would cause a compilation error
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `add` function template is only enabled for arithmetic types, preventing compilation errors for unsupported types.

### Visualizing Template Metaprogramming

To better understand how template metaprogramming works, let's visualize the process using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Template Definition] --> B[Template Instantiation]
    B --> C[Compile-Time Evaluation]
    C --> D[Generated Code]
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of template metaprogramming, from defining templates to generating code at compile time.

### Try It Yourself

1. **Create a Template Function**: Write a template function that calculates the power of a number using recursion.
2. **Implement a Type Trait**: Create a custom type trait that checks if a type is a pointer.
3. **Use SFINAE**: Implement a function that only accepts types with a specific member function.
