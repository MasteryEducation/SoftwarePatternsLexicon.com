## 3.1 Modern C++ Features (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20)

The evolution of C++ over the past decade has been nothing short of revolutionary. With the introduction of C++11, followed by C++14, C++17, and C++20, the language has embraced modern programming paradigms, improved performance, and enhanced developer productivity. In this section, we will explore the key features introduced in these versions, providing you with the knowledge to harness the full potential of modern C++.

### Lambda Functions

Lambda functions, introduced in C++11, allow you to define anonymous functions directly within your code. This feature is particularly useful for short snippets of code that are used only once or twice, such as in algorithms or event handling.

#### Syntax and Usage

A lambda function is defined using the following syntax:

```cpp
auto lambda = [](int x, int y) -> int {
    return x + y;
};
```

- **Capture Clause (`[]`)**: Specifies which variables from the surrounding scope are accessible within the lambda.
- **Parameter List (`(int x, int y)`)**: Similar to regular functions, defines the parameters.
- **Return Type (`-> int`)**: Optional; if omitted, the compiler deduces it.
- **Body (`{ return x + y; }`)**: Contains the code to be executed.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int factor = 2;

    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [factor](int& n) {
        n *= factor;
    });

    for (int n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a lambda function is used to multiply each element of a vector by a factor. The lambda captures the `factor` variable by value.

### Move Semantics and Rvalue References

Move semantics, introduced in C++11, optimize the performance of C++ programs by eliminating unnecessary copying of objects. This is achieved through rvalue references, which allow the transfer of resources from temporary objects.

#### Rvalue References

An rvalue reference is declared using `&&`:

```cpp
void processResource(Resource&& res) {
    // Use the resource
}
```

Rvalue references are used to implement move constructors and move assignment operators, enabling the efficient transfer of resources.

#### Move Constructor Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Resource {
public:
    Resource() : data(new int[100]) {}
    ~Resource() { delete[] data; }

    // Move constructor
    Resource(Resource&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr;
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    Resource& operator=(Resource&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            data = other.data;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

private:
    int* data;
};

int main() {
    Resource res1;
    Resource res2 = std::move(res1); // Move constructor
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Resource` class uses move semantics to efficiently transfer ownership of its internal data.

### `auto` and Type Inference

The `auto` keyword, introduced in C++11, allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable from its initializer. This feature reduces verbosity and improves code readability.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    auto x = 42; // int
    auto y = 3.14; // double
    auto z = "Hello"; // const char*

    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (auto n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `auto` is used to infer the types of variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, as well as the loop variable `n`.

### `decltype` and `constexpr`

#### `decltype`

`decltype` is a keyword introduced in C++11 that inspects the declared type of an expression. It is particularly useful for template programming and type deduction.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T1, typename T2>
auto add(T1 a, T2 b) -> decltype(a + b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << add(1, 2.5) << std::endl; // Output: 3.5
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `decltype` is used to deduce the return type of the `add` function.

#### `constexpr`

`constexpr` is a keyword introduced in C++11 that allows functions and variables to be evaluated at compile time, improving performance by reducing runtime computations.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    constexpr int result = square(5); // Computed at compile time
    std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output: 25
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `square` function is evaluated at compile time, resulting in a more efficient program.

### Uniform Initialization

Uniform initialization, introduced in C++11, provides a consistent syntax for initializing variables and objects, reducing ambiguity and potential errors.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Point {
public:
    int x, y;
    Point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
};

int main() {
    int a{5};
    double b{3.14};
    Point p{1, 2};
    std::vector<int> numbers{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    std::cout << "a: " << a << ", b: " << b << ", p: (" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, uniform initialization is used to initialize variables of different types, as well as a custom class `Point`.

### `std::async` and Futures

`std::async` and futures, introduced in C++11, provide a high-level abstraction for asynchronous programming, allowing you to execute tasks concurrently without dealing directly with threads.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>

int computeSquare(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    std::future<int> result = std::async(computeSquare, 5);

    std::cout << "The square of 5 is: " << result.get() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::async` is used to execute the `computeSquare` function asynchronously, and a `std::future` is used to retrieve the result.

### Structured Bindings

Structured bindings, introduced in C++17, allow you to decompose objects into individual variables, improving code readability and reducing boilerplate.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>

std::tuple<int, double, std::string> getData() {
    return {1, 3.14, "Hello"};
}

int main() {
    auto [i, d, s] = getData();
    std::cout << "i: " << i << ", d: " << d << ", s: " << s << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, structured bindings are used to unpack the elements of a `std::tuple` into individual variables.

### Concepts (C++20)

Concepts, introduced in C++20, provide a way to specify constraints on template parameters, improving code readability and error messages.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <concepts>

template <typename T>
concept Addable = requires(T a, T b) {
    { a + b } -> std::convertible_to<T>;
};

template <Addable T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << add(1, 2) << std::endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a concept `Addable` is defined to constrain the `add` function template to types that support addition.

### Modules (C++20)

Modules, introduced in C++20, provide a new way to organize and manage code, improving compile times and reducing dependencies.

#### Example

```cpp
// math.ixx
export module math;

export int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// main.cpp
import math;
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << add(1, 2) << std::endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a module `math` is defined and imported in `main.cpp`, demonstrating the use of modules to encapsulate functionality.

### Coroutines (C++20)

Coroutines, introduced in C++20, provide a powerful mechanism for asynchronous programming, allowing functions to be suspended and resumed.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <coroutine>

struct Generator {
    struct promise_type {
        int current_value;
        std::suspend_always yield_value(int value) {
            current_value = value;
            return {};
        }
        std::suspend_always initial_suspend() { return {}; }
        std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept { return {}; }
        Generator get_return_object() { return Generator{this}; }
        void return_void() {}
        void unhandled_exception() { std::terminate(); }
    };

    struct iterator {
        std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> handle;
        bool operator!=(std::default_sentinel_t) const { return !handle.done(); }
        iterator& operator++() {
            handle.resume();
            return *this;
        }
        int operator*() const { return handle.promise().current_value; }
    };

    iterator begin() { return iterator{handle}; }
    std::default_sentinel_t end() { return {}; }

    Generator(promise_type* p) : handle(std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(*p)) {}
    ~Generator() { handle.destroy(); }

private:
    std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> handle;
};

Generator sequence(int start, int end) {
    for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
        co_yield i;
    }
}

int main() {
    for (int value : sequence(1, 5)) {
        std::cout << value << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a coroutine `sequence` generates a sequence of numbers, demonstrating the use of coroutines for lazy evaluation.

### Ranges (C++20)

The Ranges library, introduced in C++20, provides a new way to work with sequences, offering a more expressive and flexible approach to algorithms and iterators.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int n : numbers | std::views::filter([](int x) { return x % 2 == 0; }) | std::views::transform([](int x) { return x * x; })) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the Ranges library is used to filter and transform a sequence of numbers, demonstrating the power of ranges for composing operations.
