## 10.2 Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic memory allocation is a cornerstone of C++ programming, enabling developers to manage memory efficiently and flexibly. Understanding how to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically is crucial for building robust and performant applications. In this section, we will explore the intricacies of dynamic memory allocation in C++, including the use of `new` and `delete`, overloading allocation operators, and creating allocator-aware data structures.

### Understanding Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic memory allocation allows programs to request memory from the heap at runtime, which is essential for applications that require variable amounts of memory or need to manage complex data structures. Unlike stack memory, which is automatically managed and limited in size, heap memory provides greater flexibility but requires explicit management by the programmer.

#### Key Concepts

- **Heap Memory**: A large pool of memory available for dynamic allocation. Unlike stack memory, heap memory is not automatically freed when a function exits.
- **Pointers**: Variables that store memory addresses, used to access dynamically allocated memory.
- **Memory Leaks**: Occur when dynamically allocated memory is not properly deallocated, leading to wasted resources.

### Using `new` and `delete`

In C++, the `new` operator is used to allocate memory dynamically, while the `delete` operator is used to deallocate memory. Let's delve into how these operators work and how to use them effectively.

#### Allocating Memory with `new`

The `new` operator allocates memory on the heap and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. It can be used to allocate memory for a single object or an array of objects.

```cpp
// Allocating memory for a single integer
int* ptr = new int;

// Allocating memory for an array of integers
int* arr = new int[10];
```

#### Deallocating Memory with `delete`

The `delete` operator frees the memory allocated by `new`. It is crucial to use `delete` to prevent memory leaks.

```cpp
// Deallocating memory for a single integer
delete ptr;

// Deallocating memory for an array of integers
delete[] arr;
```

#### Best Practices

- Always pair `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- Set pointers to `nullptr` after deleting to avoid dangling pointers.
- Avoid using `delete` on pointers that were not allocated with `new`.

### Overloading Allocation Operators

C++ allows developers to overload the `new` and `delete` operators to customize memory allocation and deallocation. This can be useful for implementing custom memory management strategies, such as pooling or tracking allocations.

#### Overloading `new` and `delete`

To overload `new` and `delete`, define them as static member functions or global functions. Here's an example of overloading these operators for a class:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void* operator new(size_t size) {
        std::cout << "Custom new for MyClass\n";
        return ::operator new(size);
    }

    void operator delete(void* ptr) {
        std::cout << "Custom delete for MyClass\n";
        ::operator delete(ptr);
    }
};
```

#### Considerations

- Ensure that overloaded operators handle all cases, including exceptions.
- Use overloading judiciously, as it can complicate memory management.

### Allocator-Aware Data Structures

Allocator-aware data structures allow developers to specify custom memory allocators, providing greater control over memory allocation. This is particularly useful in performance-critical applications where memory allocation patterns can significantly impact performance.

#### The Standard Allocator Interface

The C++ Standard Library provides an allocator interface that can be used to define custom allocators. The `std::allocator` class template is the default allocator used by STL containers.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyAllocator {
public:
    using value_type = T;

    MyAllocator() = default;

    template <typename U>
    MyAllocator(const MyAllocator<U>&) {}

    T* allocate(std::size_t n) {
        std::cout << "Allocating " << n << " elements\n";
        return static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
    }

    void deallocate(T* ptr, std::size_t n) {
        std::cout << "Deallocating " << n << " elements\n";
        ::operator delete(ptr);
    }
};
```

#### Using Custom Allocators with STL Containers

STL containers can be instantiated with custom allocators, allowing fine-grained control over memory allocation.

```cpp
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int, MyAllocator<int>> vec;
    vec.push_back(10);
    vec.push_back(20);
}
```

### Visualizing Dynamic Memory Allocation

To better understand the flow of dynamic memory allocation, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Program
    participant Heap
    Program->>Heap: Request memory with new
    Heap-->>Program: Return memory address
    Program->>Heap: Release memory with delete
    Heap-->>Program: Confirm deallocation
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code by modifying the number of elements allocated or changing the custom allocator's behavior.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
class MyAllocator {
public:
    using value_type = T;

    MyAllocator() = default;

    template <typename U>
    MyAllocator(const MyAllocator<U>&) {}

    T* allocate(std::size_t n) {
        std::cout << "Allocating " << n << " elements\n";
        return static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
    }

    void deallocate(T* ptr, std::size_t n) {
        std::cout << "Deallocating " << n << " elements\n";
        ::operator delete(ptr);
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<int, MyAllocator<int>> vec;
    vec.push_back(10);
    vec.push_back(20);

    // Try changing the number of elements or the allocator's behavior
    vec.resize(5);
}
```
