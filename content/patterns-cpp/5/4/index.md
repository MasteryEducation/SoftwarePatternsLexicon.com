## 5.4 Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful when you need to work with tree-like structures where nodes can be both simple and complex objects.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Composite Pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is achieved by defining a common interface for both simple and composite objects, enabling recursive composition.

### Key Participants

1. **Component**: An abstract class that declares the interface for objects in the composition. It can include methods for accessing and managing child components.
2. **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.
3. **Composite**: Defines behavior for components having children and stores child components. It implements child-related operations in the Component interface.
4. **Client**: Manipulates objects in the composition through the Component interface.

### Applicability

Use the Composite Pattern when:
- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- You want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.
- You need to create a structure where individual objects and compositions are treated uniformly.

### Implementing Composite with Inheritance and Polymorphism

To implement the Composite Pattern in C++, we use inheritance to define the Component interface and polymorphism to allow different implementations for Leaf and Composite objects.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

// Component interface
class Component {
public:
    virtual void operation() const = 0;
    virtual void add(std::shared_ptr<Component> component) {}
    virtual void remove(std::shared_ptr<Component> component) {}
    virtual std::shared_ptr<Component> getChild(int index) { return nullptr; }
    virtual ~Component() = default;
};

// Leaf class
class Leaf : public Component {
public:
    void operation() const override {
        std::cout << "Leaf operation" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Composite class
class Composite : public Component {
private:
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Component>> children;
public:
    void operation() const override {
        std::cout << "Composite operation" << std::endl;
        for (const auto& child : children) {
            child->operation();
        }
    }

    void add(std::shared_ptr<Component> component) override {
        children.push_back(component);
    }

    void remove(std::shared_ptr<Component> component) override {
        children.erase(std::remove(children.begin(), children.end(), component), children.end());
    }

    std::shared_ptr<Component> getChild(int index) override {
        if (index < 0 || index >= children.size()) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        return children[index];
    }
};

// Client code
void clientCode(std::shared_ptr<Component> component) {
    component->operation();
}

int main() {
    auto leaf1 = std::make_shared<Leaf>();
    auto leaf2 = std::make_shared<Leaf>();
    auto composite = std::make_shared<Composite>();

    composite->add(leaf1);
    composite->add(leaf2);

    clientCode(composite);

    return 0;
}
```

### Managing Collections of Objects

In the Composite Pattern, managing collections of objects is crucial. The Composite class maintains a collection of child components and implements methods to add, remove, and access these children. This allows for flexible and dynamic composition of objects.

#### Safe and Transparent Composites

The Composite Pattern can be implemented in two ways: safe and transparent. 

- **Safe Composite**: The Component interface only includes operations that are meaningful for all components, such as `operation()`. Methods like `add()`, `remove()`, and `getChild()` are only defined in the Composite class. This prevents clients from calling these methods on leaf nodes, ensuring type safety.

- **Transparent Composite**: All methods are declared in the Component interface, allowing clients to treat all components uniformly. However, this approach can lead to runtime errors if clients attempt to add or remove children from leaf nodes.

### Design Considerations

When using the Composite Pattern, consider the following:

- **Uniformity vs. Safety**: Decide whether to prioritize uniformity (transparent composite) or type safety (safe composite).
- **Performance**: Composite structures can become complex and impact performance. Consider the cost of operations like adding or removing children.
- **Memory Management**: Use smart pointers to manage memory and avoid leaks, especially when dealing with dynamic compositions.

### Differences and Similarities

The Composite Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both involve tree structures, the Decorator Pattern focuses on adding responsibilities to objects dynamically, whereas the Composite Pattern focuses on part-whole hierarchies.

### Visualizing Composite Pattern

Below is a class diagram illustrating the Composite Pattern structure:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +operation()*
        +add(Component component)
        +remove(Component component)
        +getChild(int index) Component
    }

    class Leaf {
        +operation()
    }

    class Composite {
        +operation()
        +add(Component component)
        +remove(Component component)
        +getChild(int index) Component
        -children : List~Component~
    }

    Component <|-- Leaf
    Component <|-- Composite
    Composite o-- Component
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Composite Pattern by modifying the code example:

- **Add a new type of Leaf**: Create a new class derived from Component and implement a different operation.
- **Implement a method to count the number of children**: Add a method in the Composite class to return the number of child components.
- **Create a more complex tree structure**: Add more levels to the tree and observe how operations are propagated through the hierarchy.
