## 5.2 Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate seamlessly. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating legacy code with new systems or when using third-party libraries that do not match your application's interface requirements.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter Pattern is to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It allows classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. By using an adapter, we can reuse existing classes without modifying their source code, thus adhering to the open/closed principle.

### Key Participants

- **Target**: Defines the domain-specific interface that the Client uses.
- **Client**: Collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
- **Adaptee**: Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
- **Adapter**: Adapts the interface of the Adaptee to the Target interface.

### Class Adapter vs. Object Adapter

There are two main types of adapters: class adapters and object adapters. Let's explore each type in detail.

#### Class Adapter

A class adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another. It inherits publicly from the Target interface and privately from the Adaptee. This approach allows the adapter to override the Target's methods and implement them using the Adaptee's methods.

**Advantages:**
- Can override Adaptee's behavior since it is a subclass.
- More efficient than object adapters because it doesn't require an additional level of indirection.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires multiple inheritance, which can lead to complexity and is not supported in some languages.
- Tightly couples the adapter to the Adaptee, making it less flexible.

#### Object Adapter

An object adapter uses composition to adapt one interface to another. It contains an instance of the Adaptee and implements the Target interface by delegating calls to the Adaptee.

**Advantages:**
- More flexible as it allows the adapter to work with any subclass of Adaptee.
- Does not require multiple inheritance, making it simpler and more portable.

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly less efficient due to the additional level of indirection.

### Implementing Adapters in C++

Let's delve into implementing both class and object adapters in C++.

#### Class Adapter Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Target interface
class Target {
public:
    virtual void request() const {
        std::cout << "Target: Default behavior." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class Adaptee {
public:
    void specificRequest() const {
        std::cout << "Adaptee: Specific behavior." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Class Adapter using multiple inheritance
class ClassAdapter : public Target, private Adaptee {
public:
    void request() const override {
        specificRequest(); // Adapting the interface
    }
};

int main() {
    Target* target = new ClassAdapter();
    target->request(); // Output: Adaptee: Specific behavior.
    delete target;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `ClassAdapter` inherits from both `Target` and `Adaptee`. It overrides the `request` method of `Target` to call the `specificRequest` method of `Adaptee`, thus adapting the interface.

#### Object Adapter Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Target interface
class Target {
public:
    virtual void request() const {
        std::cout << "Target: Default behavior." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Adaptee class with an incompatible interface
class Adaptee {
public:
    void specificRequest() const {
        std::cout << "Adaptee: Specific behavior." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Object Adapter using composition
class ObjectAdapter : public Target {
private:
    Adaptee* adaptee;
public:
    ObjectAdapter(Adaptee* a) : adaptee(a) {}

    void request() const override {
        adaptee->specificRequest(); // Adapting the interface
    }
};

int main() {
    Adaptee* adaptee = new Adaptee();
    Target* target = new ObjectAdapter(adaptee);
    target->request(); // Output: Adaptee: Specific behavior.
    delete adaptee;
    delete target;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `ObjectAdapter` contains an instance of `Adaptee` and delegates the `request` call to the `specificRequest` method of `Adaptee`.

### Using Multiple Inheritance for Class Adapters

C++ supports multiple inheritance, which allows us to implement class adapters. However, multiple inheritance can introduce complexity, such as the diamond problem, where a class inherits from two classes that have a common base class. To mitigate such issues, C++ provides virtual inheritance, which ensures that only one instance of the common base class is inherited.

Here's an example demonstrating multiple inheritance with virtual inheritance:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Base class
class Base {
public:
    virtual void baseMethod() const {
        std::cout << "Base method." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 1
class Derived1 : virtual public Base {
public:
    void derived1Method() const {
        std::cout << "Derived1 method." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 2
class Derived2 : virtual public Base {
public:
    void derived2Method() const {
        std::cout << "Derived2 method." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Class Adapter inheriting from both Derived1 and Derived2
class MultipleInheritanceAdapter : public Derived1, public Derived2 {
public:
    void request() const {
        baseMethod(); // Accessing Base method
        derived1Method();
        derived2Method();
    }
};

int main() {
    MultipleInheritanceAdapter adapter;
    adapter.request();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `MultipleInheritanceAdapter` inherits from both `Derived1` and `Derived2`, which in turn inherit from `Base`. By using virtual inheritance, we ensure that only one instance of `Base` is present in `MultipleInheritanceAdapter`.

### Design Considerations

When deciding to use the Adapter Pattern, consider the following:

- **Compatibility**: Use the adapter pattern when you need to integrate classes with incompatible interfaces.
- **Flexibility**: Object adapters are more flexible than class adapters as they allow for adapting multiple Adaptees.
- **Performance**: Class adapters are more efficient than object adapters due to the lack of indirection.
- **Complexity**: Be cautious with multiple inheritance in class adapters, as it can introduce complexity and maintenance challenges.

### Differences and Similarities

The Adapter Pattern is often confused with the following patterns:

- **Facade Pattern**: Both patterns provide a simplified interface to a complex system. However, the facade pattern defines a new interface, while the adapter pattern adapts an existing one.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Both patterns involve wrapping objects. However, the decorator pattern adds new behavior, while the adapter pattern changes the interface.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

Let's use a Mermaid.js diagram to visualize the relationships in the Adapter Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }
    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter --> Adaptee
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Target`, `Adaptee`, and `Adapter` classes. The `Adapter` class implements the `Target` interface and holds a reference to the `Adaptee`, allowing it to adapt the `Adaptee`'s interface to the `Target`.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Adapter Pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- **Experiment with Class Adapter**: Modify the `ClassAdapter` to add additional functionality before or after calling `specificRequest`.
- **Experiment with Object Adapter**: Create a new `Adaptee` class with a different method and adapt it using the `ObjectAdapter`.
- **Explore Multiple Inheritance**: Add another base class to the `MultipleInheritanceAdapter` and observe how virtual inheritance affects the behavior.
