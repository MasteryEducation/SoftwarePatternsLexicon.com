## 2.6 Operator Overloading

Operator overloading is a powerful feature in C++ that allows developers to redefine the way operators work with user-defined types. By enabling operators to work with custom objects, you can make your classes more intuitive and easier to use. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of operator overloading, explore the rules and best practices, and provide comprehensive examples to illustrate these concepts.

### Understanding Operator Overloading

#### What is Operator Overloading?

Operator overloading allows you to define the behavior of operators (such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `==`, etc.) for your custom types. This means you can use these operators with objects of your classes just as you would with built-in types. For instance, if you have a `Complex` number class, you can overload the `+` operator to add two `Complex` numbers.

#### Why Use Operator Overloading?

- **Intuitive Syntax**: Operator overloading allows you to use operators in a way that is natural and intuitive, making your code easier to read and maintain.
- **Consistency**: It provides a consistent interface for your custom types, similar to built-in types.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: By overloading operators, you can extend the functionality of your classes and make them more versatile.

### Rules and Best Practices

#### Rules for Operator Overloading

1. **Cannot Create New Operators**: You can only overload existing operators. You cannot create new operators.
2. **Preserve Operator Arity**: The number of operands an operator takes cannot be changed. For example, you cannot make the unary `-` operator take two operands.
3. **Respect Operator Precedence**: The precedence and associativity of operators cannot be changed.
4. **Overload as Member or Non-member**: Operators can be overloaded as member functions or non-member functions. However, certain operators (like `=`) must be overloaded as member functions.
5. **Return Types**: The return type of an overloaded operator can be any type, but it should be consistent with the operator's expected behavior.

#### Best Practices for Operator Overloading

- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure that the overloaded operators behave in a way that is consistent with their use on built-in types.
- **Use Friend Functions Wisely**: Use friend functions for binary operators when the left operand is not an object of your class.
- **Avoid Overloading Unintuitive Operators**: Do not overload operators in a way that is not intuitive or expected.
- **Document Overloaded Operators**: Clearly document the behavior of overloaded operators to avoid confusion.
- **Consider Performance**: Be mindful of performance implications, especially with operators that involve complex computations.

### Implementing Operator Overloading

Let's explore how to implement operator overloading with a practical example. We'll create a `Complex` class and overload several operators to demonstrate the process.

#### Example: Overloading Operators for a Complex Number Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Complex {
private:
    double real;
    double imag;

public:
    // Constructor
    Complex(double r = 0.0, double i = 0.0) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overload the + operator
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }

    // Overload the - operator
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real - other.real, imag - other.imag);
    }

    // Overload the * operator
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real * other.real - imag * other.imag,
                       real * other.imag + imag * other.real);
    }

    // Overload the == operator
    bool operator==(const Complex& other) const {
        return (real == other.real) && (imag == other.imag);
    }

    // Friend function to overload the << operator
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Complex& c) {
        os << c.real << " + " << c.imag << "i";
        return os;
    }

    // Friend function to overload the >> operator
    friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, Complex& c) {
        is >> c.real >> c.imag;
        return is;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(3.0, 4.0);
    Complex c2(1.0, 2.0);

    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;
    Complex c4 = c1 - c2;
    Complex c5 = c1 * c2;

    std::cout << "c1: " << c1 << "\n";
    std::cout << "c2: " << c2 << "\n";
    std::cout << "c1 + c2: " << c3 << "\n";
    std::cout << "c1 - c2: " << c4 << "\n";
    std::cout << "c1 * c2: " << c5 << "\n";

    if (c1 == c2) {
        std::cout << "c1 and c2 are equal.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "c1 and c2 are not equal.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code

- **Constructor**: Initializes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
- **Operator `+`**: Adds two complex numbers by adding their real and imaginary parts separately.
- **Operator `-`**: Subtracts one complex number from another.
- **Operator `*`**: Multiplies two complex numbers using the formula `(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i`.
- **Operator `==`**: Compares two complex numbers for equality.
- **Friend Functions**: Used to overload the `<<` and `>>` operators for input and output operations.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the `Complex` class by adding more operators, such as `/` for division or `!=` for inequality. You can also try implementing the `+=` and `-=` operators to modify the current object.

### Visualizing Operator Overloading

To better understand how operator overloading works, let's visualize the process using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Complex {
        double real
        double imag
        Complex(double r, double i)
        Complex operator+(Complex& other)
        Complex operator-(Complex& other)
        Complex operator*(Complex& other)
        bool operator==(Complex& other)
        ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, Complex& c)
        istream& operator>>(istream& is, Complex& c)
    }
```

This diagram illustrates the `Complex` class with its member functions and overloaded operators.

### Advanced Operator Overloading Techniques

#### Overloading Unary Operators

Unary operators, such as `++`, `--`, and `-`, can also be overloaded. These operators typically operate on a single operand.

```cpp
class Counter {
private:
    int count;

public:
    Counter(int c = 0) : count(c) {}

    // Overload the prefix ++ operator
    Counter& operator++() {
        ++count;
        return *this;
    }

    // Overload the postfix ++ operator
    Counter operator++(int) {
        Counter temp = *this;
        ++count;
        return temp;
    }

    // Overload the unary - operator
    Counter operator-() const {
        return Counter(-count);
    }

    int getCount() const {
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Counter c(5);

    ++c; // Prefix increment
    std::cout << "After prefix increment: " << c.getCount() << "\n";

    c++; // Postfix increment
    std::cout << "After postfix increment: " << c.getCount() << "\n";

    Counter neg = -c; // Unary minus
    std::cout << "Negated counter: " << neg.getCount() << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of Unary Operator Overloading

- **Prefix `++`**: Increments the count and returns the incremented object.
- **Postfix `++`**: Increments the count but returns the original object before incrementing.
- **Unary `-`**: Returns a new `Counter` object with the negated count.

### Operator Overloading for Custom Containers

Operator overloading is particularly useful for custom container classes, such as matrices or vectors. Let's explore how to overload operators for a simple `Matrix` class.

#### Example: Overloading Operators for a Matrix Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Matrix {
private:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> data;
    int rows, cols;

public:
    Matrix(int r, int c) : rows(r), cols(c), data(r, std::vector<int>(c)) {}

    // Overload the + operator
    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& other) const {
        if (rows != other.rows || cols != other.cols) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Matrices must have the same dimensions.");
        }

        Matrix result(rows, cols);
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                result.data[i][j] = data[i][j] + other.data[i][j];
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    // Overload the << operator for output
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Matrix& m) {
        for (const auto& row : m.data) {
            for (int val : row) {
                os << val << " ";
            }
            os << "\n";
        }
        return os;
    }
};

int main() {
    Matrix m1(2, 2);
    Matrix m2(2, 2);

    // Initialize matrices
    m1 = Matrix({{1, 2}, {3, 4}});
    m2 = Matrix({{5, 6}, {7, 8}});

    Matrix m3 = m1 + m2;

    std::cout << "Matrix m1:\n" << m1;
    std::cout << "Matrix m2:\n" << m2;
    std::cout << "Matrix m1 + m2:\n" << m3;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of the Matrix Example

- **Operator `+`**: Adds two matrices element-wise. Throws an exception if the dimensions do not match.
- **Operator `<<`**: Outputs the matrix to the console.

### Design Considerations

When overloading operators, consider the following design aspects:

- **Consistency with Built-in Types**: Ensure that your overloaded operators behave similarly to their built-in counterparts.
- **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error handling, such as throwing exceptions for invalid operations.
- **Performance**: Be aware of the performance implications of your overloaded operators, especially for complex data structures.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

Operator overloading can sometimes be confused with function overloading. While both involve defining multiple behaviors for a single name, operator overloading is specifically for operators, whereas function overloading is for functions with different parameter lists.
