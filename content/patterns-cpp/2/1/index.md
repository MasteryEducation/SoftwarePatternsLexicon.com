## 2.1 Object-Oriented Programming in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several key concepts, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. In this section, we will explore these concepts in the context of C++, a language that has been at the forefront of OOP since its inception.

### Classes and Objects

In C++, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). An object is an instance of a class.

#### Defining a Class

To define a class in C++, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces. Inside the braces, you define the class's attributes and methods.

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;
    std::string model;
    int year;

    void displayInfo() {
        std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
    }
};
```

In this example, `Car` is a class with three public attributes: `brand`, `model`, and `year`, and one method `displayInfo()`.

#### Creating Objects

Once a class is defined, you can create objects of that class type. Here's how you can create an object of the `Car` class and use it:

```cpp
int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.model = "Corolla";
    myCar.year = 2020;
    myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: Brand: Toyota, Model: Corolla, Year: 2020
    return 0;
}
```

#### Constructors and Destructors

Constructors are special class functions that are called when a new object of the class is created. They initialize the object's attributes. Destructors, on the other hand, are called when an object is destroyed and are used to free resources.

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;
    std::string model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    Car(std::string b, std::string m, int y) : brand(b), model(m), year(y) {}

    // Destructor
    ~Car() {
        std::cout << "Destroying Car: " << brand << " " << model << std::endl;
    }

    void displayInfo() {
        std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Inheritance allows a class (derived class) to inherit the properties and behavior of another class (base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

#### Implementing Inheritance

In C++, inheritance is implemented by specifying a colon and the access specifier followed by the base class name.

```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    std::string brand;
    void honk() {
        std::cout << "Beep beep!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    std::string model;
    int year;
};
```

Here, `Car` inherits from `Vehicle`, meaning `Car` objects have access to the `brand` attribute and `honk()` method.

#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. This is achieved through method overriding and virtual functions.

##### Virtual Functions

To enable polymorphism, declare a method in the base class as `virtual`. This tells the compiler to support late binding for this method.

```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void honk() {
        std::cout << "Vehicle beep!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void honk() override {
        std::cout << "Car beep!" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

In this example, calling `honk()` on a `Vehicle` pointer that points to a `Car` object will call the `Car`'s version of `honk()`.

#### Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a base class. It contains at least one pure virtual function, which is declared by assigning `0` to it.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Woof!" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class, and `Dog` is a concrete class that implements the `makeSound()` method.

### Encapsulation and Abstraction

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.

#### Implementing Encapsulation

In C++, encapsulation is achieved using access specifiers: `public`, `protected`, and `private`.

```cpp
class Box {
private:
    double length;
    double width;
    double height;

public:
    void setDimensions(double l, double w, double h) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }

    double getVolume() {
        return length * width * height;
    }
};
```

In this example, the dimensions of the `Box` are private, and they can only be set and accessed through public methods.

#### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

```cpp
class AbstractShape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0;
    virtual double perimeter() const = 0;
};

class Circle : public AbstractShape {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    double area() const override {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }

    double perimeter() const override {
        return 2 * 3.14159 * radius;
    }
};
```

In this example, `AbstractShape` provides an abstract interface for shapes, and `Circle` implements this interface.

### Visualizing Object-Oriented Concepts

To better understand the relationships between classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, let's visualize these concepts using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Vehicle {
        +string brand
        +void honk()
    }
    class Car {
        +string model
        +int year
        +void honk()
    }
    class Animal {
        +void makeSound()
    }
    class Dog {
        +void makeSound()
    }
    Vehicle <|-- Car
    Animal <|-- Dog
```

This diagram shows the inheritance relationship between `Vehicle` and `Car`, and `Animal` and `Dog`. It also highlights the polymorphic nature of the `honk()` and `makeSound()` methods.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided above. Try modifying the `Car` class to include additional methods or attributes. Implement a new class that inherits from `Vehicle` and override the `honk()` method. This hands-on practice will reinforce your understanding of OOP concepts in C++.
