## 4.7 Multiton Pattern

In the world of software design patterns, the Multiton pattern stands out as a powerful tool for managing a limited number of instances of a class. While the Singleton pattern ensures a single instance, the Multiton pattern allows for multiple instances, each identified by a unique key. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances of a class are needed, but their number should be controlled and managed efficiently.

### Intent

The intent of the Multiton pattern is to ensure that a class has a limited number of instances, each associated with a unique key. It provides a global point of access to these instances, ensuring that the same instance is returned for a given key.

### Key Participants

1. **Multiton Class**: The class that manages the instances.
2. **Instances**: The actual objects being managed.
3. **Key**: A unique identifier for each instance.

### Applicability

Use the Multiton pattern when:

- You need to manage a fixed number of instances of a class.
- Each instance should be uniquely identified by a key.
- You want to ensure that the same instance is returned for a given key.

### Implementing the Multiton Pattern

Let's dive into the implementation of the Multiton pattern in C++. We'll start by defining a class that manages instances using a static map to store and retrieve them based on a unique key.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <memory>
#include <mutex>
#include <string>

class Multiton {
public:
    using Ptr = std::shared_ptr<Multiton>;

    // Static method to get the instance associated with a key
    static Ptr getInstance(const std::string& key) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
        auto it = instances_.find(key);
        if (it == instances_.end()) {
            it = instances_.emplace(key, std::make_shared<Multiton>(key)).first;
        }
        return it->second;
    }

    // Method to demonstrate functionality
    void show() const {
        std::cout << "Instance with key: " << key_ << std::endl;
    }

private:
    // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
    Multiton(const std::string& key) : key_(key) {}

    std::string key_;
    static std::map<std::string, Ptr> instances_;
    static std::mutex mutex_;
};

// Initialize static members
std::map<std::string, Multiton::Ptr> Multiton::instances_;
std::mutex Multiton::mutex_;

int main() {
    auto instance1 = Multiton::getInstance("First");
    auto instance2 = Multiton::getInstance("Second");
    auto instance3 = Multiton::getInstance("First");

    instance1->show();
    instance2->show();
    instance3->show();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

- **Static Map**: We use a static map to store instances of the class, indexed by a unique key.
- **Mutex**: A mutex is used to ensure thread safety when accessing the map.
- **Shared Pointers**: Instances are stored as `std::shared_ptr` to manage their lifetimes automatically.
- **Private Constructor**: The constructor is private to prevent direct instantiation.

### Design Considerations

- **Thread Safety**: Ensure that access to the instance map is thread-safe, especially in a multithreaded environment.
- **Memory Management**: Use smart pointers to manage the lifetimes of instances.
- **Key Management**: Decide on a strategy for generating and managing keys.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Singleton vs. Multiton**: While Singleton restricts a class to a single instance, Multiton allows multiple instances, each identified by a key.
- **Factory Method**: Like the Factory Method, Multiton involves creating instances, but it also manages their uniqueness and lifecycle.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Configuration Management

In applications where different configurations are needed for different modules, the Multiton pattern can manage configuration instances, each identified by a module name.

```cpp
class Configuration {
public:
    static std::shared_ptr<Configuration> getConfig(const std::string& moduleName) {
        return Multiton::getInstance(moduleName);
    }

    void setParameter(const std::string& param, const std::string& value) {
        parameters_[param] = value;
    }

    std::string getParameter(const std::string& param) const {
        auto it = parameters_.find(param);
        return it != parameters_.end() ? it->second : "";
    }

private:
    Configuration(const std::string& moduleName) : moduleName_(moduleName) {}

    std::string moduleName_;
    std::map<std::string, std::string> parameters_;
};
```

#### Database Connections

For applications requiring multiple database connections, each identified by a connection string or database name, the Multiton pattern can manage these connections efficiently.

```cpp
class DatabaseConnection {
public:
    static std::shared_ptr<DatabaseConnection> getConnection(const std::string& dbName) {
        return Multiton::getInstance(dbName);
    }

    void query(const std::string& sql) {
        std::cout << "Executing query on database " << dbName_ << ": " << sql << std::endl;
    }

private:
    DatabaseConnection(const std::string& dbName) : dbName_(dbName) {}

    std::string dbName_;
};
```

### Visualizing the Multiton Pattern

To better understand the Multiton pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Multiton {
        +getInstance(key: string) : Ptr
        -Multiton(key: string)
        -key_: string
        -instances_: map<string, Ptr>
        -mutex_: mutex
    }
    class Ptr
    Multiton --> Ptr : manages
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram shows the Multiton class managing instances through a map, with each instance identified by a key. The `getInstance` method provides access to these instances.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Multiton pattern by modifying the code examples:

- **Add New Keys**: Try adding more keys and retrieving instances for them.
- **Thread Safety**: Test the code in a multithreaded environment to ensure thread safety.
- **Custom Keys**: Implement a custom key generation strategy.
