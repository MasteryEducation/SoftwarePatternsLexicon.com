## 4.3 Factory Patterns

In the realm of software design, Factory Patterns play a pivotal role in managing object creation. They provide a way to encapsulate the instantiation process, allowing for more flexible and scalable code. In C++, Factory Patterns are particularly useful due to the language's complex type system and the need for efficient memory management. In this section, we will delve into three primary types of Factory Patterns: the Simple Factory Pattern, the Factory Method Pattern, and the Abstract Factory Pattern. Each of these patterns offers unique advantages and can be applied in different scenarios to enhance your software architecture.

### Simple Factory Pattern

#### Intent
The Simple Factory Pattern aims to encapsulate the object creation logic in a single place. It provides a static method that returns instances of different classes based on input parameters. This pattern is not a part of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns but is a widely used idiom in object-oriented programming.

#### Key Participants
- **Factory**: The class responsible for creating objects.
- **Product**: The interface or abstract class for the objects created by the factory.
- **ConcreteProduct**: The specific implementations of the Product interface.

#### Applicability
Use the Simple Factory Pattern when:
- You have a large number of subclasses that share a common interface.
- You want to centralize object creation logic to reduce code duplication.
- You need to control which specific class is instantiated based on input parameters.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Product interface
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const = 0;
    virtual ~Shape() = default;
};

// ConcreteProduct: Circle
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a Circle\n";
    }
};

// ConcreteProduct: Square
class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a Square\n";
    }
};

// Factory class
class ShapeFactory {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<Shape> createShape(const std::string& type) {
        if (type == "circle") {
            return std::make_unique<Circle>();
        } else if (type == "square") {
            return std::make_unique<Square>();
        }
        return nullptr;
    }
};

// Client code
int main() {
    auto circle = ShapeFactory::createShape("circle");
    if (circle) {
        circle->draw();
    }

    auto square = ShapeFactory::createShape("square");
    if (square) {
        square->draw();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Design Considerations
- **Simplicity**: The Simple Factory Pattern is easy to implement and understand, making it a good starting point for managing object creation.
- **Scalability**: As the number of product types grows, the factory method can become unwieldy. Consider transitioning to a more sophisticated pattern if this becomes an issue.
- **Flexibility**: The pattern centralizes the creation logic, which can be both an advantage and a limitation. It simplifies maintenance but can lead to a single point of failure.

#### Differences and Similarities
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Unlike the Simple Factory, the Factory Method Pattern uses inheritance and polymorphism to delegate the instantiation process to subclasses.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: This pattern is more complex and is used to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Factory Method Pattern

#### Intent
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is a part of the GoF design patterns and promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need for the client to instantiate objects directly.

#### Key Participants
- **Product**: The interface or abstract class for objects created by the factory method.
- **ConcreteProduct**: The specific implementations of the Product interface.
- **Creator**: The abstract class that declares the factory method.
- **ConcreteCreator**: The subclasses that implement the factory method to create ConcreteProduct instances.

#### Applicability
Use the Factory Method Pattern when:
- A class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
- You want to localize the knowledge of which class gets created.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Product interface
class Button {
public:
    virtual void render() const = 0;
    virtual ~Button() = default;
};

// ConcreteProduct: WindowsButton
class WindowsButton : public Button {
public:
    void render() const override {
        std::cout << "Rendering a Windows button\n";
    }
};

// ConcreteProduct: MacOSButton
class MacOSButton : public Button {
public:
    void render() const override {
        std::cout << "Rendering a MacOS button\n";
    }
};

// Creator class
class Dialog {
public:
    virtual std::unique_ptr<Button> createButton() const = 0;
    void render() const {
        auto button = createButton();
        button->render();
    }
    virtual ~Dialog() = default;
};

// ConcreteCreator: WindowsDialog
class WindowsDialog : public Dialog {
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Button> createButton() const override {
        return std::make_unique<WindowsButton>();
    }
};

// ConcreteCreator: MacOSDialog
class MacOSDialog : public Dialog {
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Button> createButton() const override {
        return std::make_unique<MacOSButton>();
    }
};

// Client code
int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<Dialog> dialog = std::make_unique<WindowsDialog>();
    dialog->render();

    dialog = std::make_unique<MacOSDialog>();
    dialog->render();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Design Considerations
- **Extensibility**: The Factory Method Pattern allows new product types to be added without modifying existing code.
- **Complexity**: This pattern introduces additional classes and interfaces, which can increase the complexity of the codebase.
- **Polymorphism**: It leverages polymorphism to allow subclasses to determine the concrete class of the object being created.

#### Differences and Similarities
- **Simple Factory Pattern**: The Factory Method Pattern is more flexible as it allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: While the Factory Method Pattern deals with a single product, the Abstract Factory Pattern involves creating families of related products.

### Abstract Factory Pattern

#### Intent
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is a part of the GoF design patterns and is useful when a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created.

#### Key Participants
- **AbstractFactory**: Declares an interface for operations that create abstract products.
- **ConcreteFactory**: Implements the operations to create concrete product objects.
- **AbstractProduct**: Declares an interface for a type of product object.
- **ConcreteProduct**: Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory.
- **Client**: Uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes.

#### Applicability
Use the Abstract Factory Pattern when:
- A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- You want to provide a library of products, and you only want to reveal their interfaces, not their implementations.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// AbstractProductA
class Chair {
public:
    virtual void sitOn() const = 0;
    virtual ~Chair() = default;
};

// ConcreteProductA1
class VictorianChair : public Chair {
public:
    void sitOn() const override {
        std::cout << "Sitting on a Victorian chair\n";
    }
};

// ConcreteProductA2
class ModernChair : public Chair {
public:
    void sitOn() const override {
        std::cout << "Sitting on a Modern chair\n";
    }
};

// AbstractProductB
class Sofa {
public:
    virtual void lieOn() const = 0;
    virtual ~Sofa() = default;
};

// ConcreteProductB1
class VictorianSofa : public Sofa {
public:
    void lieOn() const override {
        std::cout << "Lying on a Victorian sofa\n";
    }
};

// ConcreteProductB2
class ModernSofa : public Sofa {
public:
    void lieOn() const override {
        std::cout << "Lying on a Modern sofa\n";
    }
};

// AbstractFactory
class FurnitureFactory {
public:
    virtual std::unique_ptr<Chair> createChair() const = 0;
    virtual std::unique_ptr<Sofa> createSofa() const = 0;
    virtual ~FurnitureFactory() = default;
};

// ConcreteFactory1
class VictorianFurnitureFactory : public FurnitureFactory {
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Chair> createChair() const override {
        return std::make_unique<VictorianChair>();
    }
    std::unique_ptr<Sofa> createSofa() const override {
        return std::make_unique<VictorianSofa>();
    }
};

// ConcreteFactory2
class ModernFurnitureFactory : public FurnitureFactory {
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Chair> createChair() const override {
        return std::make_unique<ModernChair>();
    }
    std::unique_ptr<Sofa> createSofa() const override {
        return std::make_unique<ModernSofa>();
    }
};

// Client code
void clientCode(const FurnitureFactory& factory) {
    auto chair = factory.createChair();
    auto sofa = factory.createSofa();
    chair->sitOn();
    sofa->lieOn();
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Client: Testing client code with the Victorian factory:\n";
    VictorianFurnitureFactory victorianFactory;
    clientCode(victorianFactory);

    std::cout << "\nClient: Testing the same client code with the Modern factory:\n";
    ModernFurnitureFactory modernFactory;
    clientCode(modernFactory);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Design Considerations
- **Scalability**: The Abstract Factory Pattern makes it easy to introduce new variants of products without changing existing code.
- **Complexity**: It can add complexity due to the increased number of classes and interfaces.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that products from the same family are used together, maintaining consistency in the system.

#### Differences and Similarities
- **Factory Method Pattern**: The Abstract Factory Pattern is more abstract and is used to create families of related objects, whereas the Factory Method Pattern deals with a single product.
- **Simple Factory Pattern**: The Abstract Factory Pattern is more structured and is used when there are multiple families of products.

### Visualizing Factory Patterns

    }
    class VictorianFurnitureFactory {
        +createChair() Chair
        +createSofa() Sofa
    }
    class ModernFurnitureFactory {
        +createChair() Chair
        +createSofa() Sofa
    }
    Chair <|-- VictorianChair
    Chair <|-- ModernChair
    Sofa <|-- VictorianSofa
    Sofa <|-- ModernSofa
    FurnitureFactory <|-- VictorianFurnitureFactory
    FurnitureFactory <|-- ModernFurnitureFactory
    FurnitureFactory --> Chair
    FurnitureFactory --> Sofa
```
