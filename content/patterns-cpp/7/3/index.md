## 7.3 Synchronization Patterns

In the realm of concurrent programming, synchronization is a critical aspect that ensures the correct execution of threads. In C++, synchronization patterns help manage access to shared resources, prevent race conditions, and maintain data consistency. This section delves into the intricacies of synchronization patterns, focusing on mutexes, locks, deadlock avoidance strategies, reader-writer locks, and condition variables. By mastering these patterns, you will be able to design robust and efficient multithreaded applications.

### Using Mutexes and Locks

Mutexes (short for mutual exclusions) are fundamental synchronization primitives that prevent multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously. They ensure that only one thread can access the critical section of code at a time, thus preventing race conditions.

#### Key Concepts

- **Mutex**: A mutex is a locking mechanism that ensures mutual exclusion. When a thread locks a mutex, other threads attempting to lock it will be blocked until it is unlocked.
- **Lock**: A lock is an abstraction that manages the acquisition and release of a mutex. C++ provides several types of locks, such as `std::lock_guard` and `std::unique_lock`.

#### Code Example: Basic Mutex Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx; // Mutex for critical section
int counter = 0;

void incrementCounter() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx); // Lock the mutex
        ++counter; // Critical section
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(incrementCounter);
    std::thread t2(incrementCounter);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << counter << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::lock_guard` is used to lock the mutex `mtx` during the increment operation, ensuring that only one thread can modify `counter` at a time.

#### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Mutexes can introduce overhead due to context switching and blocking. Use them judiciously to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **Deadlock**: Improper use of mutexes can lead to deadlocks, where two or more threads are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks.

### Deadlock Avoidance Strategies

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a lock. To avoid deadlocks, consider the following strategies:

#### 1. Lock Ordering

Establish a global order in which locks must be acquired. By ensuring that all threads acquire locks in the same order, you can prevent circular wait conditions.

#### 2. Try-Lock

Use `std::try_lock` to attempt to acquire multiple locks without blocking. If a lock cannot be acquired, release any already acquired locks and retry.

#### Code Example: Try-Lock

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx1, mtx2;

void taskA() {
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock1(mtx1, std::defer_lock);
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock2(mtx2, std::defer_lock);

        if (std::try_lock(lock1, lock2) == -1) {
            // Both locks acquired
            std::cout << "Task A acquired both locks\n";
            break;
        }
    }
}

void taskB() {
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock1(mtx1, std::defer_lock);
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock2(mtx2, std::defer_lock);

        if (std::try_lock(lock1, lock2) == -1) {
            // Both locks acquired
            std::cout << "Task B acquired both locks\n";
            break;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(taskA);
    std::thread t2(taskB);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::try_lock` attempts to lock both `mtx1` and `mtx2`. If it fails to acquire both locks, it releases any acquired locks and retries.

#### 3. Avoid Nested Locks

Minimize the use of nested locks, as they increase the complexity of lock management and the likelihood of deadlocks.

#### 4. Use Timed Locks

Use timed locks like `std::timed_mutex` to specify a timeout period for acquiring a lock. If the lock cannot be acquired within the timeout, the thread can take alternative actions.

### Reader-Writer Locks

Reader-writer locks allow multiple threads to read a shared resource concurrently while ensuring exclusive access for write operations. This pattern is useful when read operations are more frequent than write operations.

#### Key Concepts

- **Read Lock**: Allows multiple threads to read the resource simultaneously.
- **Write Lock**: Ensures exclusive access to the resource for writing.

#### Code Example: Reader-Writer Lock

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <shared_mutex>
#include <vector>

std::shared_mutex rw_mutex;
std::vector<int> data;

void reader(int id) {
    std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(rw_mutex);
    std::cout << "Reader " << id << " is reading data\n";
    for (int val : data) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

void writer(int id, int value) {
    std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(rw_mutex);
    std::cout << "Writer " << id << " is writing data\n";
    data.push_back(value);
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(reader, 1);
    std::thread t2(writer, 1, 10);
    std::thread t3(reader, 2);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::shared_mutex` is used to allow multiple readers to access the `data` vector concurrently, while writers have exclusive access.

#### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Reader-writer locks can improve performance in scenarios with frequent read operations. However, they may introduce overhead due to lock management.
- **Starvation**: Writers may experience starvation if readers continuously hold the lock. Implementing a fair scheduling policy can mitigate this issue.

### Condition Variables and Notifications

Condition variables are synchronization primitives that enable threads to wait for certain conditions to be met. They are used in conjunction with mutexes to coordinate the execution of threads.

#### Key Concepts

- **Condition Variable**: A condition variable allows one or more threads to wait until they are notified by another thread that a condition has been met.
- **Notification**: Threads can be notified using `notify_one` or `notify_all` to wake up waiting threads.

#### Code Example: Condition Variable

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

std::mutex cv_mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool ready = false;

void worker(int id) {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(cv_mtx);
    cv.wait(lock, [] { return ready; });
    std::cout << "Worker " << id << " is processing data\n";
}

void signal() {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(cv_mtx);
        ready = true;
    }
    cv.notify_all();
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(worker, 1);
    std::thread t2(worker, 2);
    std::thread t3(signal);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `cv.wait` is used to block the worker threads until the `ready` condition is set to true. The `signal` function sets the condition and notifies all waiting threads.

#### Design Considerations

- **Spurious Wakeups**: Condition variables may experience spurious wakeups, where a thread is awakened without a notification. Always check the condition in a loop.
- **Performance**: Condition variables can improve performance by reducing busy-waiting. However, they may introduce complexity in managing conditions and notifications.

### Visualizing Synchronization Patterns

To better understand how these synchronization patterns work, let's visualize the interaction between threads, mutexes, and condition variables using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Thread1
    participant Mutex
    participant ConditionVariable
    participant Thread2

    Thread1->>Mutex: Lock
    Mutex-->>Thread1: Acquired
    Thread1->>ConditionVariable: Wait
    ConditionVariable-->>Thread1: Blocked
    Thread2->>Mutex: Lock
    Mutex-->>Thread2: Blocked
    Thread1->>ConditionVariable: Notify
    ConditionVariable-->>Thread1: Unblocked
    Thread1->>Mutex: Unlock
    Mutex-->>Thread2: Acquired
    Thread2->>Mutex: Unlock
```

This diagram illustrates the sequence of events when using a mutex and condition variable to synchronize two threads. Thread1 locks the mutex and waits on the condition variable, blocking itself. Thread2 attempts to lock the mutex but is blocked until Thread1 unlocks it.

### Try It Yourself
