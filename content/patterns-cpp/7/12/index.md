## 7.12 Reactor and Proactor Patterns

Concurrency and multithreading are critical aspects of modern software development, especially when it comes to building scalable and responsive systems. In this section, we will delve into two powerful design patterns that facilitate efficient event handling in concurrent systems: the Reactor and Proactor patterns. These patterns are instrumental in managing I/O operations and are widely used in network programming and systems that require high throughput and low latency.

### Reactor Pattern

#### Intent

The Reactor pattern is designed to handle service requests that are delivered concurrently to an application by one or more clients. It demultiplexes and dispatches these requests to the appropriate request handlers. The pattern is particularly useful for synchronous event handling, where events are processed as they occur.

#### Key Participants

- **Event Demultiplexer**: Waits for events to occur on a set of handles.
- **Event Handler**: Defines an interface for handling events.
- **Concrete Event Handler**: Implements the event handling interface.
- **Reactor**: Manages the registration of event handlers and dispatches events to the appropriate handlers.

#### Applicability

Use the Reactor pattern when you need to handle multiple service requests that arrive concurrently and require synchronous processing. It is ideal for applications where the number of clients is large, but the number of active clients at any given time is small.

#### Implementing the Reactor Pattern

The Reactor pattern can be implemented using mechanisms such as `select`, `poll`, or `epoll` in Linux. These system calls allow a program to monitor multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/epoll.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

class EventHandler {
public:
    virtual void handleEvent(uint32_t events) = 0;
    virtual int getHandle() const = 0;
    virtual ~EventHandler() = default;
};

class Reactor {
public:
    void registerHandler(EventHandler* handler) {
        struct epoll_event ev;
        ev.events = EPOLLIN; // Interested in read events
        ev.data.ptr = handler;
        if (epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, handler->getHandle(), &ev) == -1) {
            std::cerr << "Failed to add handler: " << strerror(errno) << std::endl;
        }
    }

    void handleEvents() {
        std::vector<struct epoll_event> events(max_events);
        while (true) {
            int nfds = epoll_wait(epoll_fd, events.data(), max_events, -1);
            for (int n = 0; n < nfds; ++n) {
                EventHandler* handler = static_cast<EventHandler*>(events[n].data.ptr);
                handler->handleEvent(events[n].events);
            }
        }
    }

    Reactor() : epoll_fd(epoll_create1(0)), max_events(10) {
        if (epoll_fd == -1) {
            std::cerr << "Failed to create epoll file descriptor: " << strerror(errno) << std::endl;
        }
    }

    ~Reactor() {
        close(epoll_fd);
    }

private:
    int epoll_fd;
    const int max_events;
};

// Example concrete event handler
class ConcreteEventHandler : public EventHandler {
public:
    explicit ConcreteEventHandler(int fd) : fd(fd) {}

    void handleEvent(uint32_t events) override {
        if (events & EPOLLIN) {
            char buffer[1024];
            ssize_t bytes = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
            if (bytes > 0) {
                std::cout << "Read " << bytes << " bytes: " << buffer << std::endl;
            }
        }
    }

    int getHandle() const override {
        return fd;
    }

private:
    int fd;
};

int main() {
    Reactor reactor;
    int fd = /* file descriptor to monitor */;
    ConcreteEventHandler handler(fd);
    reactor.registerHandler(&handler);
    reactor.handleEvents();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Reactor` class uses `epoll` to monitor file descriptors for read events. The `ConcreteEventHandler` class implements the `EventHandler` interface and processes the events.

#### Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: The Reactor pattern is well-suited for applications with a large number of clients but a small number of active connections.
- **Complexity**: Managing state and handling events can become complex as the number of event types and handlers increases.
- **Blocking Operations**: Ensure that event handlers do not perform blocking operations, as this can delay the processing of other events.

### Proactor Pattern

#### Intent

The Proactor pattern is designed to handle asynchronous event handling. It allows an application to initiate an operation and then be notified upon its completion. This pattern is particularly useful for operations that can be performed asynchronously, such as I/O operations.

#### Key Participants

- **Initiator**: Initiates an asynchronous operation.
- **Completion Handler**: Defines an interface for handling the completion of an operation.
- **Asynchronous Operation Processor**: Executes the operation asynchronously and notifies the completion handler upon completion.
- **Proactor**: Manages the registration of completion handlers and dispatches completion events.

#### Applicability

Use the Proactor pattern when you need to handle operations that can be performed asynchronously, such as file I/O or network communication. It is ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency.

#### Implementing the Proactor Pattern

The Proactor pattern can be implemented using overlapped I/O and completion ports on Windows or using asynchronous I/O libraries on other platforms.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <asio.hpp>

class CompletionHandler {
public:
    virtual void handleCompletion(const asio::error_code& error, std::size_t bytes_transferred) = 0;
    virtual ~CompletionHandler() = default;
};

class Proactor {
public:
    void registerHandler(CompletionHandler* handler) {
        handlers.push_back(handler);
    }

    void handleEvents() {
        io_context.run();
    }

    asio::io_context& getContext() {
        return io_context;
    }

private:
    asio::io_context io_context;
    std::vector<CompletionHandler*> handlers;
};

// Example concrete completion handler
class ConcreteCompletionHandler : public CompletionHandler {
public:
    void handleCompletion(const asio::error_code& error, std::size_t bytes_transferred) override {
        if (!error) {
            std::cout << "Operation completed successfully, bytes transferred: " << bytes_transferred << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cerr << "Error: " << error.message() << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Proactor proactor;
    asio::ip::tcp::socket socket(proactor.getContext());
    ConcreteCompletionHandler handler;
    proactor.registerHandler(&handler);

    // Example of an asynchronous operation
    socket.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data, max_length),
        [&](const asio::error_code& error, std::size_t bytes_transferred) {
            handler.handleCompletion(error, bytes_transferred);
        });

    proactor.handleEvents();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Proactor` class uses the `asio` library to manage asynchronous operations. The `ConcreteCompletionHandler` class implements the `CompletionHandler` interface and processes the completion events.

#### Design Considerations

- **Concurrency**: The Proactor pattern is well-suited for applications that require high concurrency and low latency.
- **Complexity**: Managing asynchronous operations and completion handlers can become complex as the number of operations increases.
- **Platform Support**: Ensure that the platform supports asynchronous I/O operations.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Reactor vs. Proactor**: The Reactor pattern is synchronous, while the Proactor pattern is asynchronous. The Reactor pattern waits for events to occur and then processes them, whereas the Proactor pattern initiates operations and handles their completion.
- **Use Cases**: Use the Reactor pattern for applications with a large number of clients but a small number of active connections. Use the Proactor pattern for applications that require high throughput and low latency.
- **Complexity**: Both patterns can become complex as the number of event types and handlers increases. However, the Proactor pattern can be more complex due to the need to manage asynchronous operations.

### Visualizing the Reactor and Proactor Patterns

Let's visualize the flow of events in the Reactor and Proactor patterns using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Reactor Pattern Flow

    participant Reactor
    participant EventHandler
    Client->>Reactor: Event Occurs
    Reactor->>EventHandler: Dispatch Event
    EventHandler->>Reactor: Handle Event
```

#### Proactor Pattern Flow

```mermaid

```
