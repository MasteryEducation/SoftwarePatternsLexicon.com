## 7.5 Active Object Pattern

In the realm of concurrent programming, managing the execution of tasks efficiently while maintaining a clear separation between method invocation and execution is crucial. The Active Object Pattern is a powerful design pattern that addresses this need by decoupling method execution from method invocation. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be executed asynchronously, allowing the invoking thread to continue its execution without waiting for the task to complete.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Active Object Pattern is to decouple method execution from method invocation to enhance concurrency and responsiveness in applications. By introducing a separate thread or a pool of threads to handle method execution, the pattern allows the main thread to remain responsive and continue processing other tasks.

### Key Participants

1. **Proxy**: Provides an interface for clients to interact with the active object. It encapsulates the method invocation and forwards requests to the scheduler.

2. **Scheduler**: Manages the task queue and decides when and how tasks are executed. It is responsible for dispatching tasks to the appropriate threads.

3. **Method Request**: Represents a task to be executed. It encapsulates the method call and any required parameters.

4. **Servant**: The actual object that performs the task. It contains the business logic that needs to be executed.

5. **Future**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It allows clients to retrieve the result once the computation is complete.

### Applicability

The Active Object Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- Tasks need to be executed asynchronously to improve responsiveness.
- There is a need to manage a pool of worker threads efficiently.
- Tasks can be queued and executed in a controlled manner.
- The client should not be blocked while waiting for a task to complete.

### Implementing the Active Object Pattern in C++

Let's explore how to implement the Active Object Pattern in C++ using modern concurrency features such as `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`, and `std::future`.

#### Step 1: Define the Method Request

The Method Request is a crucial component of the Active Object Pattern. It encapsulates the task to be executed along with any necessary parameters.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>
#include <future>

// MethodRequest class encapsulates a task to be executed
class MethodRequest {
public:
    using Task = std::function<void()>;

    explicit MethodRequest(Task task) : task_(std::move(task)) {}

    void execute() {
        task_();
    }

private:
    Task task_;
};
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Scheduler

The Scheduler is responsible for managing the task queue and dispatching tasks to worker threads.

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

class Scheduler {
public:
    Scheduler() : stop_(false) {
        worker_ = std::thread(&Scheduler::run, this);
    }

    ~Scheduler() {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
            stop_ = true;
        }
        cond_var_.notify_all();
        worker_.join();
    }

    void enqueue(MethodRequest::Task task) {
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
            tasks_.emplace(std::move(task));
        }
        cond_var_.notify_one();
    }

private:
    void run() {
        while (true) {
            MethodRequest::Task task;
            {
                std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
                cond_var_.wait(lock, [this] { return stop_ || !tasks_.empty(); });
                if (stop_ && tasks_.empty()) break;
                task = std::move(tasks_.front());
                tasks_.pop();
            }
            task();
        }
    }

    std::queue<MethodRequest::Task> tasks_;
    std::thread worker_;
    std::mutex mutex_;
    std::condition_variable cond_var_;
    bool stop_;
};
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Proxy

The Proxy provides an interface for clients to interact with the active object. It forwards method requests to the Scheduler.

```cpp
class ActiveObject {
public:
    ActiveObject() : scheduler_(std::make_shared<Scheduler>()) {}

    std::future<void> doWork() {
        auto promise = std::make_shared<std::promise<void>>();
        auto future = promise->get_future();

        scheduler_->enqueue([promise]() {
            // Simulate some work
            std::cout << "Executing task in thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
            promise->set_value();
        });

        return future;
    }

private:
    std::shared_ptr<Scheduler> scheduler_;
};
```

#### Step 4: Using the Active Object

Now, let's see how we can use the Active Object in a client application.

```cpp
int main() {
    ActiveObject activeObject;

    auto future1 = activeObject.doWork();
    auto future2 = activeObject.doWork();

    future1.get();
    future2.get();

    std::cout << "Tasks completed." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Active Object Pattern, consider the following:

- **Thread Safety**: Ensure that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner using synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables.
- **Task Prioritization**: If certain tasks need to be prioritized, consider implementing a priority queue.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle exceptions that may occur during task execution to prevent the application from crashing.
- **Resource Management**: Manage the lifecycle of threads and other resources to avoid resource leaks.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

The Active Object Pattern is often compared with the Proxy Pattern and the Command Pattern:

- **Proxy Pattern**: Both patterns involve an intermediary that forwards requests. However, the Active Object Pattern focuses on asynchronous execution, while the Proxy Pattern may not.
- **Command Pattern**: The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, similar to the Method Request in the Active Object Pattern. However, the Command Pattern does not inherently handle asynchronous execution.

### Visualizing the Active Object Pattern

To better understand the Active Object Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between its components using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy
    participant Scheduler
    participant Servant

    Client->>Proxy: Request Method
    Proxy->>Scheduler: Enqueue Method Request
    Scheduler->>Servant: Execute Method Request
    Servant-->>Scheduler: Return Result
    Scheduler-->>Proxy: Notify Completion
    Proxy-->>Client: Return Future
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of a method request from the client to the proxy, then to the scheduler, and finally to the servant for execution. The result is returned to the client through a future.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Active Object Pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- **Add Task Prioritization**: Implement a priority queue in the Scheduler to prioritize certain tasks.
- **Handle Exceptions**: Modify the code to handle exceptions that may occur during task execution.
- **Multiple Workers**: Extend the Scheduler to manage a pool of worker threads instead of a single thread.
