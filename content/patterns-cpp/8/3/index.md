## 8.3 Currying and Partial Application

In the realm of functional programming, currying and partial application are two powerful techniques that allow developers to create more modular, reusable, and expressive code. While these concepts originate from the functional programming paradigm, they can be effectively utilized in C++ to enhance code design and flexibility. In this section, we will delve deep into the concepts of currying and partial application, explore their implementation in C++, and provide practical examples to illustrate their use.

### Introduction to Currying and Partial Application

Before diving into the implementation details, let's first understand what currying and partial application are.

**Currying** is a technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for the creation of specialized functions by fixing some arguments, leading to more flexible and reusable code.

**Partial Application**, on the other hand, refers to the process of fixing a few arguments of a function, producing another function of smaller arity. While similar to currying, partial application does not necessarily transform a function into a sequence of single-argument functions.

### Currying in C++

In C++, currying can be achieved using various techniques, including lambda expressions and function objects. However, the most straightforward approach is to use `std::bind` and `std::placeholders`.

#### Using `std::bind` and `std::placeholders`

The `std::bind` function in C++ is a powerful utility that allows us to create a function object by binding arguments to a function. This is particularly useful for currying, as it enables us to fix some arguments of a function and create a new function with fewer parameters.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate currying using `std::bind`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// A simple function that takes three arguments
int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

int main() {
    // Create a curried version of the add function
    auto add_with_5 = std::bind(add, 5, std::placeholders::_1, std::placeholders::_2);

    // Use the curried function
    std::cout << "Result: " << add_with_5(3, 4) << std::endl; // Output: 12

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::bind` to fix the first argument of the `add` function to 5. The placeholders `_1` and `_2` represent the remaining arguments that the new function will accept. This effectively creates a new function that takes two arguments instead of three.

#### Currying with Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions provide another way to achieve currying in C++. They offer a more concise and flexible approach compared to `std::bind`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    // A lambda function that takes three arguments
    auto add = [](int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    };

    // Create a curried version using lambda
    auto add_with_5 = [add](int b, int c) {
        return add(5, b, c);
    };

    // Use the curried function
    std::cout << "Result: " << add_with_5(3, 4) << std::endl; // Output: 12

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a lambda function `add` that takes three arguments. We then create a curried version `add_with_5` by capturing the `add` lambda and fixing the first argument to 5.

### Partial Application in C++

Partial application in C++ can be achieved using similar techniques as currying. The key difference is that partial application does not necessarily transform a function into a sequence of single-argument functions. Instead, it allows us to fix some arguments and create a new function with fewer parameters.

#### Using `std::bind` for Partial Application

Let's revisit the `add` function and see how we can achieve partial application using `std::bind`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// A simple function that takes three arguments
int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

int main() {
    // Partially apply the add function by fixing the first two arguments
    auto add_with_5_and_3 = std::bind(add, 5, 3, std::placeholders::_1);

    // Use the partially applied function
    std::cout << "Result: " << add_with_5_and_3(4) << std::endl; // Output: 12

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::bind` to fix the first two arguments of the `add` function to 5 and 3, respectively. The placeholder `_1` represents the remaining argument that the new function will accept.

#### Partial Application with Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions can also be used for partial application, providing a more concise and flexible approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    // A lambda function that takes three arguments
    auto add = [](int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    };

    // Partially apply the lambda by fixing the first two arguments
    auto add_with_5_and_3 = [add](int c) {
        return add(5, 3, c);
    };

    // Use the partially applied function
    std::cout << "Result: " << add_with_5_and_3(4) << std::endl; // Output: 12

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a lambda function `add` that takes three arguments. We then create a partially applied version `add_with_5_and_3` by capturing the `add` lambda and fixing the first two arguments to 5 and 3.

### `std::function` and Functional Wrappers

The `std::function` class template in C++ provides a general-purpose polymorphic function wrapper. It can store, copy, and invoke any callable target—functions, lambda expressions, bind expressions, or other function objects.

#### Using `std::function` with Currying and Partial Application

`std::function` can be used in conjunction with `std::bind` and lambda expressions to create curried and partially applied functions. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// A simple function that takes three arguments
int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

int main() {
    // Use std::function to store a curried function
    std::function<int(int, int)> add_with_5 = std::bind(add, 5, std::placeholders::_1, std::placeholders::_2);

    // Use the curried function
    std::cout << "Result: " << add_with_5(3, 4) << std::endl; // Output: 12

    // Use std::function to store a partially applied function
    std::function<int(int)> add_with_5_and_3 = std::bind(add, 5, 3, std::placeholders::_1);

    // Use the partially applied function
    std::cout << "Result: " << add_with_5_and_3(4) << std::endl; // Output: 12

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::function` to store both a curried and a partially applied version of the `add` function. This allows us to easily pass these functions around as first-class objects.

### Design Considerations

When implementing currying and partial application in C++, there are several design considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Performance**: While `std::bind` and `std::function` provide powerful abstractions, they may introduce some overhead. Consider using lambda expressions for performance-critical code.

2. **Readability**: Currying and partial application can make code more expressive, but they can also reduce readability if overused. Use these techniques judiciously to strike a balance between expressiveness and clarity.

3. **Compatibility**: Ensure that your code is compatible with the C++11 standard or later, as `std::bind`, `std::function`, and lambda expressions are not available in earlier versions.

### Differences and Similarities

Currying and partial application are often confused due to their similarities. However, there are key differences:

- **Currying** transforms a function into a sequence of single-argument functions, whereas **partial application** fixes some arguments of a function, producing a new function with fewer parameters.

- Both techniques improve code modularity and reusability, but currying is more commonly associated with functional programming languages, while partial application is more prevalent in languages like C++.

### Visualizing Currying and Partial Application

To better understand the flow of currying and partial application, let's visualize these concepts using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Function: add(a, b, c)] --> B[Currying: add_with_5(b, c)]
    B --> C[Curried Function: add_with_5_and_3(c)]
    A --> D[Partial Application: add_with_5_and_3(c)]
```

This diagram illustrates how the original `add` function is transformed through currying and partial application. The curried function `add_with_5` fixes the first argument, while the partially applied function `add_with_5_and_3` fixes the first two arguments.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided in this section. Try modifying the functions to see how currying and partial application can be applied in different scenarios. For instance, create a function that takes four arguments and apply currying or partial application to fix different combinations of arguments.
