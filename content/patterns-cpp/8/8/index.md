## 8.8 Functional Reactive Programming

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm for reactive programming using the building blocks of functional programming. It is particularly useful for handling asynchronous data streams and event-driven applications. In this section, we will delve into the core concepts of FRP, explore how to implement reactive streams in C++ using RxCpp, and understand the roles of observables and observers.

### Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming

Functional Reactive Programming combines the principles of functional programming with reactive programming. It allows developers to work with asynchronous data streams and propagate changes automatically. This paradigm is particularly powerful for applications that require dynamic and responsive user interfaces, real-time data processing, and complex event handling.

#### Key Concepts of Reactive Programming

1. **Data Streams**: In FRP, data is represented as streams that can be manipulated using functional operators. These streams can be continuous or discrete, representing events over time.

2. **Observables**: Observables are the core abstraction in FRP. They represent a sequence of data or events that can be observed and reacted to.

3. **Observers**: Observers subscribe to observables to receive data or event notifications. They define how to handle each piece of data emitted by the observable.

4. **Operators**: Operators are functions that allow you to transform, filter, combine, and manipulate data streams.

5. **Schedulers**: Schedulers control the execution context of observables, enabling concurrency and parallelism.

### Implementing Reactive Streams in C++ with RxCpp

RxCpp is a library that brings the power of Reactive Extensions (Rx) to C++. It provides a rich set of operators and abstractions for working with asynchronous data streams. Let's explore how to use RxCpp to implement reactive streams in C++.

#### Setting Up RxCpp

To get started with RxCpp, you need to include the library in your project. You can install RxCpp using a package manager like vcpkg or Conan, or you can download it from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp).

```cpp
#include <rxcpp/rx.hpp>

namespace rx = rxcpp;
namespace rxu = rxcpp::util;
```

#### Creating Observables

An observable is a data source that emits items over time. In RxCpp, you can create observables using factory functions like `rx::observable<>::create` or from existing data structures.

```cpp
auto values = rx::observable<>::create<int>(
    [](rx::subscriber<int> s){
        s.on_next(1);
        s.on_next(2);
        s.on_next(3);
        s.on_completed();
    }
);
```

In this example, we create an observable that emits three integer values and then completes.

#### Subscribing to Observables

To receive data from an observable, you need to subscribe an observer to it. The observer defines how to handle each emitted item, errors, and completion.

```cpp
values.subscribe(
    [](int v) { std::cout << "OnNext: " << v << std::endl; },
    []() { std::cout << "OnCompleted" << std::endl; }
);
```

This code subscribes to the `values` observable and prints each emitted value to the console.

#### Using Operators

Operators are used to transform and manipulate data streams. RxCpp provides a wide range of operators, such as `map`, `filter`, `merge`, and `combine_latest`.

```cpp
auto transformed = values.map([](int v) { return v * 10; });

transformed.subscribe(
    [](int v) { std::cout << "Transformed OnNext: " << v << std::endl; },
    []() { std::cout << "Transformed OnCompleted" << std::endl; }
);
```

Here, we use the `map` operator to multiply each emitted value by 10.

### Observables and Observers

Observables and observers are the fundamental components of FRP. Let's explore their roles and how they interact in a reactive system.

#### Observables

Observables represent a stream of data or events. They can emit zero or more items and can complete or error out. Observables are lazy, meaning they don't emit items until an observer subscribes to them.

##### Types of Observables

1. **Cold Observables**: These observables start emitting items only when an observer subscribes. Each observer receives the full sequence of items from the start.

2. **Hot Observables**: These observables emit items regardless of whether there are subscribers. Observers receive only the items emitted after they subscribe.

#### Observers

Observers consume data emitted by observables. They define three main handlers:

1. **OnNext**: Handles each emitted item.
2. **OnError**: Handles any errors that occur.
3. **OnCompleted**: Handles the completion of the observable sequence.

```cpp
auto observer = rx::make_subscriber<int>(
    [](int v) { std::cout << "Observer OnNext: " << v << std::endl; },
    [](std::exception_ptr ep) { std::cout << "Observer OnError" << std::endl; },
    []() { std::cout << "Observer OnCompleted" << std::endl; }
);

values.subscribe(observer);
```

### Advanced Concepts in RxCpp

RxCpp provides advanced features for handling complex scenarios in reactive programming.

#### Combining Observables

You can combine multiple observables using operators like `merge`, `zip`, and `combine_latest`.

```cpp
auto obs1 = rx::observable<>::just(1, 2, 3);
auto obs2 = rx::observable<>::just(4, 5, 6);

auto combined = obs1.concat(obs2);

combined.subscribe(
    [](int v) { std::cout << "Combined OnNext: " << v << std::endl; },
    []() { std::cout << "Combined OnCompleted" << std::endl; }
);
```

#### Error Handling

RxCpp provides operators for error handling, such as `catch` and `retry`.

```cpp
auto errorObservable = rx::observable<>::create<int>(
    [](rx::subscriber<int> s){
        s.on_next(1);
        s.on_error(std::make_exception_ptr(std::runtime_error("Error")));
    }
);

errorObservable
    .catch_error([](std::exception_ptr ep) {
        return rx::observable<>::just(0);
    })
    .subscribe(
        [](int v) { std::cout << "ErrorHandled OnNext: " << v << std::endl; },
        []() { std::cout << "ErrorHandled OnCompleted" << std::endl; }
    );
```

#### Schedulers and Concurrency

Schedulers in RxCpp control the execution context of observables. They enable concurrency and parallelism.

```cpp
auto values = rx::observable<>::range(1, 5)
    .observe_on(rx::observe_on_event_loop());

values.subscribe(
    [](int v) { std::cout << "Scheduled OnNext: " << v << std::endl; },
    []() { std::cout << "Scheduled OnCompleted" << std::endl; }
);
```

### Visualizing Reactive Streams

To better understand the flow of data in reactive streams, let's visualize the interaction between observables and observers using Mermaid.js.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Observable
    participant Observer
    Observable->>Observer: onNext(data)
    Observable->>Observer: onNext(data)
    Observable->>Observer: onCompleted()
```

This diagram illustrates the sequence of events between an observable and an observer, showing how data flows from the observable to the observer.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of functional reactive programming in C++, it's time to experiment with the concepts. Try modifying the code examples to:

- Create a new observable that emits a sequence of strings.
- Use the `filter` operator to emit only even numbers from a sequence.
- Implement error handling for an observable that might throw exceptions.
