## 8.1 Introduction to Functional Programming Concepts

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. In C++, a language traditionally known for its imperative and object-oriented capabilities, embracing functional programming can lead to more predictable, maintainable, and robust code. Let's delve into the core concepts of functional programming and see how they can be applied in C++.

### Immutability

Immutability is a fundamental concept in functional programming. It refers to the idea that once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. This concept helps prevent side effects, making programs easier to understand and debug. In C++, immutability can be achieved using `const` qualifiers.

#### Benefits of Immutability

- **Predictability**: Immutable data structures lead to predictable code behavior since they do not change state after creation.
- **Thread Safety**: Immutability naturally leads to thread-safe code, as concurrent threads cannot alter immutable data.
- **Easier Debugging**: With immutable data, you can be sure that data remains consistent throughout the program's execution.

#### Implementing Immutability in C++

Let's look at an example of how immutability can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class ImmutableVector {
public:
    ImmutableVector(const std::vector<int>& data) : data_(data) {}

    int get(int index) const {
        return data_.at(index);
    }

    size_t size() const {
        return data_.size();
    }

private:
    const std::vector<int> data_;
};

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    ImmutableVector iv(data);

    std::cout << "Element at index 2: " << iv.get(2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of vector: " << iv.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `ImmutableVector` encapsulates a `std::vector<int>` and ensures that it cannot be modified after creation. The `const` keyword is used to enforce immutability.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the `ImmutableVector` class by trying to modify its data after creation. Observe how the `const` keyword prevents any changes, reinforcing the concept of immutability.

### Pure Functions

A pure function is a function where the output value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This means that calling a pure function with the same arguments will always produce the same result.

#### Characteristics of Pure Functions

- **Deterministic**: Always produces the same output for the same input.
- **No Side Effects**: Does not alter any state or interact with the outside world (e.g., no I/O operations).

#### Implementing Pure Functions in C++

Here's an example of a pure function in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// A pure function that calculates the square of a number
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Square of 5: " << square(5) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Square of 5 again: " << square(5) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The `square` function is pure because it always returns the same result for the same input and does not modify any external state.

#### Try It Yourself

Modify the `square` function to include a side effect, such as printing to the console. Observe how this changes the function's purity.

### Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. This concept allows for building complex operations from simpler ones, promoting code reuse and modularity.

#### Benefits of Function Composition

- **Modularity**: Breaks down complex operations into simpler, reusable functions.
- **Readability**: Makes code easier to understand by expressing complex operations in terms of simpler ones.

#### Implementing Function Composition in C++

Let's see how function composition can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// A function that adds two numbers
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// A function that multiplies two numbers
int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}

// A function that composes two functions
std::function<int(int, int)> compose(std::function<int(int, int)> f, std::function<int(int, int)> g) {
    return [f, g](int x, int y) {
        return f(g(x, y), y);
    };
}

int main() {
    auto addThenMultiply = compose(multiply, add);

    std::cout << "Result of addThenMultiply(2, 3): " << addThenMultiply(2, 3) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define two functions, `add` and `multiply`, and use a `compose` function to create a new function that first adds two numbers and then multiplies the result by the second number.

#### Try It Yourself

Create your own functions and use the `compose` function to combine them in different ways. Experiment with different combinations to see how function composition works in practice.

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are a powerful tool in functional programming, enabling more abstract and flexible code.

#### Benefits of Higher-Order Functions

- **Abstraction**: Allows for more abstract and flexible code by operating on functions.
- **Code Reuse**: Facilitates code reuse by enabling generic operations on functions.

#### Implementing Higher-Order Functions in C++

Here's an example of a higher-order function in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// A higher-order function that applies a function to each element of a vector
void applyFunction(std::vector<int>& vec, std::function<int(int)> func) {
    std::transform(vec.begin(), vec.end(), vec.begin(), func);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // A lambda function to double a number
    auto doubleNumber = [](int x) { return x * 2; };

    applyFunction(numbers, doubleNumber);

    for (int num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `applyFunction` is a higher-order function that takes a vector and a function as arguments. It applies the function to each element of the vector.

#### Try It Yourself

Create your own higher-order functions that operate on different types of data structures. Experiment with different functions to see how higher-order functions can be used to abstract and generalize operations.

### Visualizing Functional Programming Concepts

To better understand the flow of data and operations in functional programming, let's visualize the process of function composition and higher-order functions using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Function Composition Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input] --> B[Function g];
    B --> C[Function f];
    C --> D[Output];
```

**Caption**: This flowchart illustrates the process of function composition, where the output of function `g` becomes the input to function `f`, resulting in the final output.

#### Higher-Order Function Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Vector] --> B[Higher-Order Function];
    B --> C[Function Applied to Each Element];
    C --> D[Transformed Vector];
```

**Caption**: This flowchart shows how a higher-order function applies a given function to each element of an input vector, resulting in a transformed vector.
