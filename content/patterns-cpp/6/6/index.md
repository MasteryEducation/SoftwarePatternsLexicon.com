## 6.6 Mediator Pattern

In the realm of software design patterns, the Mediator Pattern stands out as a powerful tool for reducing the complexity of communication between components. By centralizing control, it minimizes dependencies and enhances maintainability. In this section, we will delve into the Mediator Pattern, exploring its intent, key participants, applicability, and implementation in C++, particularly in GUI applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Mediator Pattern is to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly and allowing their interaction to be varied independently.

### Key Participants

1. **Mediator**: Defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects.
2. **ConcreteMediator**: Implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects and knows and maintains its colleagues.
3. **Colleague**: Each Colleague class knows its Mediator object and communicates with its Mediator whenever it would have otherwise communicated with another Colleague.

### Applicability

The Mediator Pattern is particularly useful when:

- A set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways.
- Reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects.
- You want to customize a behavior that is distributed between several classes without subclassing.

### Reducing Coupling Between Components

In complex systems, components often need to communicate with each other. Direct communication can lead to a tangled web of dependencies, making the system hard to maintain and extend. The Mediator Pattern addresses this by introducing a mediator object that handles communication between components.

#### Example: Chat Room

Consider a chat room where users can send messages to each other. Without a mediator, each user would need to know about every other user to send messages. By introducing a mediator, each user only needs to know about the mediator, which handles message distribution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Forward declaration
class User;

// Mediator Interface
class ChatRoomMediator {
public:
    virtual void showMessage(User* user, const std::string& message) = 0;
};

// Colleague
class User {
protected:
    ChatRoomMediator* mediator;
    std::string name;
public:
    User(ChatRoomMediator* med, const std::string& name) : mediator(med), name(name) {}
    virtual void sendMessage(const std::string& message) = 0;
    virtual std::string getName() const { return name; }
};

// Concrete Colleague
class ConcreteUser : public User {
public:
    ConcreteUser(ChatRoomMediator* med, const std::string& name) : User(med, name) {}
    void sendMessage(const std::string& message) override {
        mediator->showMessage(this, message);
    }
};

// Concrete Mediator
class ChatRoom : public ChatRoomMediator {
private:
    std::vector<User*> users;
public:
    void addUser(User* user) {
        users.push_back(user);
    }
    void showMessage(User* user, const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << user->getName() << ": " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    ChatRoom* chatRoom = new ChatRoom();

    User* user1 = new ConcreteUser(chatRoom, "Alice");
    User* user2 = new ConcreteUser(chatRoom, "Bob");

    chatRoom->addUser(user1);
    chatRoom->addUser(user2);

    user1->sendMessage("Hello Bob!");
    user2->sendMessage("Hi Alice!");

    delete user1;
    delete user2;
    delete chatRoom;

    return 0;
}
```

### Centralizing Complex Communications

The Mediator Pattern centralizes communication logic, which simplifies the system's design and makes it easier to understand and maintain. This is especially beneficial in systems where components frequently interact in complex ways.

#### Implementing Mediator in GUI Applications

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often involve numerous components that need to interact, such as buttons, text fields, and sliders. The Mediator Pattern can be used to manage these interactions, reducing the coupling between components.

Consider a dialog box with several widgets. Without a mediator, each widget would need to know about the others to coordinate actions. By introducing a mediator, each widget only communicates with the mediator, which orchestrates the interactions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Forward declaration
class Button;
class TextBox;

// Mediator Interface
class DialogMediator {
public:
    virtual void notify(Button* sender, const std::string& event) = 0;
    virtual void notify(TextBox* sender, const std::string& event) = 0;
};

// Colleague
class Widget {
protected:
    DialogMediator* mediator;
public:
    Widget(DialogMediator* med) : mediator(med) {}
};

// Concrete Colleague
class Button : public Widget {
public:
    Button(DialogMediator* med) : Widget(med) {}
    void click() {
        std::cout << "Button clicked." << std::endl;
        mediator->notify(this, "click");
    }
};

// Concrete Colleague
class TextBox : public Widget {
private:
    std::string text;
public:
    TextBox(DialogMediator* med) : Widget(med) {}
    void setText(const std::string& txt) {
        text = txt;
        std::cout << "TextBox text set to: " << text << std::endl;
        mediator->notify(this, "textChanged");
    }
    std::string getText() const { return text; }
};

// Concrete Mediator
class Dialog : public DialogMediator {
private:
    Button* button;
    TextBox* textBox;
public:
    Dialog(Button* btn, TextBox* txtBox) : button(btn), textBox(txtBox) {}
    void notify(Button* sender, const std::string& event) override {
        if (event == "click") {
            std::cout << "Dialog handling button click." << std::endl;
            textBox->setText("Button was clicked!");
        }
    }
    void notify(TextBox* sender, const std::string& event) override {
        if (event == "textChanged") {
            std::cout << "Dialog handling text change: " << sender->getText() << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Button* button = new Button(nullptr);
    TextBox* textBox = new TextBox(nullptr);
    Dialog* dialog = new Dialog(button, textBox);

    button->click();
    textBox->setText("New Text");

    delete button;
    delete textBox;
    delete dialog;

    return 0;
}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Mediator Pattern, consider the following:

- **Complexity**: While the Mediator Pattern reduces the complexity of communication between components, it can increase the complexity of the mediator itself. Ensure the mediator remains manageable.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The mediator should only handle communication between components. Avoid adding unrelated functionality to the mediator.
- **Performance**: Centralizing communication can introduce a bottleneck if the mediator becomes overloaded. Ensure the mediator can handle the expected load.

### Differences and Similarities

The Mediator Pattern is often confused with the Observer Pattern. While both patterns involve communication between components, they serve different purposes:

- **Mediator Pattern**: Centralizes communication, reducing dependencies between components.
- **Observer Pattern**: Allows components to be notified of changes in other components.

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

Let's visualize the Mediator Pattern to better understand its structure and interactions.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Mediator {
        <<interface>>
        +notify(Colleague, event)
    }
    class ConcreteMediator {
        +notify(Colleague, event)
    }
    class Colleague {
        +mediator: Mediator
        +notify(event)
    }
    class ConcreteColleague {
        +notify(event)
    }
    Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
    Colleague <|-- ConcreteColleague
    ConcreteColleague --> Mediator : uses
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored the Mediator Pattern, try implementing it in a different context. For example, create a traffic control system where traffic lights and pedestrian signals communicate through a mediator. Experiment with adding new features or modifying existing ones to see how the mediator handles changes.
