## 6.12 Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that allows you to define new operations on an object structure without modifying the objects themselves. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex object structures and type hierarchies. It enables you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate, facilitating cleaner and more maintainable code.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Visitor Pattern is to separate an algorithm from the object structure it operates on. This separation allows you to add new operations without altering the classes of the elements on which it operates. The pattern is especially useful for operations that need to be performed on a group of related objects, where the operation might vary based on the object's type.

### Key Participants

1. **Visitor**: Declares a `visit` operation for each class of `ConcreteElement` in the object structure. The operation's name and signature identify the class that sends the `visit` request to the visitor.

2. **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements each operation declared by `Visitor`. Each operation implements a fragment of the algorithm defined for the corresponding class of object in the structure.

3. **Element**: Defines an `accept` operation that takes a visitor as an argument.

4. **ConcreteElement**: Implements the `accept` operation that takes a visitor as an argument.

5. **ObjectStructure**: Can enumerate its elements and may provide a high-level interface to allow the visitor to visit its elements.

### Applicability

Use the Visitor Pattern when:

- An object structure contains many classes of objects with differing interfaces, and you want to perform operations on these objects that depend on their concrete classes.
- Many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on objects in an object structure, and you want to avoid "polluting" their classes with these operations.
- The classes defining the object structure rarely change, but you often want to define new operations over the structure.

### Implementing Double Dispatch

Double dispatch is a technique that allows a function to be dynamically dispatched based on the runtime types of two objects. In the context of the Visitor Pattern, double dispatch is used to call a method on a visitor object that is specific to the type of the element being visited.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's illustrate the Visitor Pattern with a simple example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

// Forward declarations
class ConcreteElementA;
class ConcreteElementB;

// Visitor interface
class Visitor {
public:
    virtual void visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA* element) = 0;
    virtual void visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB* element) = 0;
};

// Element interface
class Element {
public:
    virtual ~Element() = default;
    virtual void accept(Visitor* visitor) = 0;
};

// ConcreteElementA
class ConcreteElementA : public Element {
public:
    void accept(Visitor* visitor) override {
        visitor->visitConcreteElementA(this);
    }
    void operationA() {
        std::cout << "ConcreteElementA operation.\n";
    }
};

// ConcreteElementB
class ConcreteElementB : public Element {
public:
    void accept(Visitor* visitor) override {
        visitor->visitConcreteElementB(this);
    }
    void operationB() {
        std::cout << "ConcreteElementB operation.\n";
    }
};

// ConcreteVisitor
class ConcreteVisitor : public Visitor {
public:
    void visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA* element) override {
        std::cout << "Visiting ConcreteElementA.\n";
        element->operationA();
    }
    void visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB* element) override {
        std::cout << "Visiting ConcreteElementB.\n";
        element->operationB();
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Element>> elements;
    elements.push_back(std::make_unique<ConcreteElementA>());
    elements.push_back(std::make_unique<ConcreteElementB>());

    ConcreteVisitor visitor;
    for (auto& element : elements) {
        element->accept(&visitor);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Visitor Interface**: Defines the `visit` methods for each `ConcreteElement`. This allows the visitor to perform operations on each type of element.

2. **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the `visit` methods. Each method performs an operation on the element it visits.

3. **Element Interface**: Declares the `accept` method, which takes a visitor as an argument.

4. **ConcreteElementA and ConcreteElementB**: Implement the `accept` method, which calls the appropriate `visit` method on the visitor.

5. **Main Function**: Creates a list of elements and a visitor. It then iterates over the elements, allowing the visitor to perform operations on each one.

### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: The Visitor Pattern is ideal when you have a stable class hierarchy and need to add new operations frequently. It allows you to keep the operations separate from the object structure, enhancing maintainability.

- **C++ Specific Features**: In C++, the Visitor Pattern can take advantage of polymorphism and dynamic dispatch to achieve double dispatch. The use of smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`) ensures proper memory management.

- **Pitfalls**: The Visitor Pattern can become cumbersome if the object structure changes frequently, as each change requires updating the visitor interface and all concrete visitors.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Similar to Strategy Pattern**: Both patterns encapsulate algorithms, but the Visitor Pattern is more about performing operations on a set of objects, while the Strategy Pattern is about selecting algorithms at runtime.

- **Different from Command Pattern**: The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. The Visitor Pattern focuses on separating operations from the objects they operate on.

### Visualizing the Visitor Pattern

Below is a class diagram illustrating the Visitor Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Visitor {
        <<interface>>
        +visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA* element)
        +visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB* element)
    }
    class ConcreteVisitor {
        +visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA* element)
        +visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB* element)
    }
    class Element {
        <<interface>>
        +accept(Visitor* visitor)
    }
    class ConcreteElementA {
        +accept(Visitor* visitor)
        +operationA()
    }
    class ConcreteElementB {
        +accept(Visitor* visitor)
        +operationB()
    }
    Visitor <|.. ConcreteVisitor
    Element <|.. ConcreteElementA
    Element <|.. ConcreteElementB
    ConcreteElementA --> Visitor : accept
    ConcreteElementB --> Visitor : accept
```

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Visitor Pattern, try modifying the code example:

- **Add a new ConcreteElement**: Implement a new element class and update the visitor to handle it.
- **Add a new Visitor**: Create a new visitor class that performs different operations on the elements.
- **Experiment with Smart Pointers**: Replace `std::unique_ptr` with `std::shared_ptr` and observe the changes.
