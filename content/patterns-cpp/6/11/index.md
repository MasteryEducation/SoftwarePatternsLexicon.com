## 6.11 Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a fixed sequence of steps, but some steps require customization.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Template Method Pattern is to define the overall structure of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to alter specific steps. This pattern promotes code reuse and enforces a consistent algorithm structure across different implementations.

### Key Participants

1. **Abstract Class**: Declares the template method and defines the algorithm's skeleton. It may also provide default implementations for some steps.
2. **Concrete Class**: Implements the abstract class and overrides specific steps of the algorithm as needed.

### Applicability

Use the Template Method Pattern when:
- You want to implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once and allow subclasses to provide specific behaviors.
- You have several classes that contain similar algorithms with minor differences.
- You want to control the extensions of certain steps in an algorithm.

### Structure

Here's a class diagram illustrating the Template Method Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractClass {
        +templateMethod()
        +primitiveOperation1()
        +primitiveOperation2()
    }
    class ConcreteClass {
        +primitiveOperation1()
        +primitiveOperation2()
    }
    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClass
```

### Implementing the Template Method Pattern in C++

Let's delve into the implementation details of the Template Method Pattern in C++. We'll start by defining an abstract class with a template method and then create concrete classes that override specific steps.

#### Abstract Class

The abstract class defines the template method and declares the primitive operations that subclasses must implement.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class AbstractClass {
public:
    // The template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm.
    void templateMethod() {
        primitiveOperation1();
        primitiveOperation2();
        hook();
    }

    // Primitive operations to be implemented by subclasses.
    virtual void primitiveOperation1() = 0;
    virtual void primitiveOperation2() = 0;

    // A hook method that can be overridden by subclasses.
    virtual void hook() {}
};
```

#### Concrete Classes

Concrete classes implement the primitive operations and can override the hook method if needed.

```cpp
class ConcreteClassA : public AbstractClass {
public:
    void primitiveOperation1() override {
        std::cout << "ConcreteClassA: Implementing Operation 1" << std::endl;
    }

    void primitiveOperation2() override {
        std::cout << "ConcreteClassA: Implementing Operation 2" << std::endl;
    }
};

class ConcreteClassB : public AbstractClass {
public:
    void primitiveOperation1() override {
        std::cout << "ConcreteClassB: Implementing Operation 1" << std::endl;
    }

    void primitiveOperation2() override {
        std::cout << "ConcreteClassB: Implementing Operation 2" << std::endl;
    }

    void hook() override {
        std::cout << "ConcreteClassB: Overriding Hook Method" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

#### Client Code

The client code interacts with the abstract class, allowing the template method to execute the algorithm with the specific steps provided by concrete classes.

```cpp
int main() {
    ConcreteClassA classA;
    ConcreteClassB classB;

    std::cout << "Executing Template Method for ConcreteClassA:" << std::endl;
    classA.templateMethod();

    std::cout << "\nExecuting Template Method for ConcreteClassB:" << std::endl;
    classB.templateMethod();

    return 0;
}
```

### Design Considerations

- **Invariant Parts**: The template method should encapsulate the invariant parts of an algorithm, ensuring that the overall structure remains consistent across subclasses.
- **Hook Methods**: Use hook methods to provide optional extension points in the algorithm. Subclasses can override these methods to add additional behavior.
- **C++ Specific Features**: Leverage C++ features such as virtual functions and inheritance to implement the Template Method Pattern effectively.

### Differences and Similarities

The Template Method Pattern is often confused with the Strategy Pattern. While both patterns involve defining a family of algorithms, the Template Method Pattern defines the algorithm's skeleton in a superclass, allowing subclasses to override specific steps. In contrast, the Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Template Method Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions:
- Add a new concrete class that implements the abstract class and provides a unique implementation for the primitive operations.
- Introduce additional hook methods in the abstract class and override them in the concrete classes.
- Experiment with different algorithm structures by altering the sequence of steps in the template method.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

To further illustrate the Template Method Pattern, let's visualize the flow of control when the template method is called:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AbstractClass
    participant ConcreteClassA
    Client->>AbstractClass: templateMethod()
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClassA: primitiveOperation1()
    ConcreteClassA-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClassA: primitiveOperation2()
    ConcreteClassA-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass->>ConcreteClassA: hook()
    ConcreteClassA-->>AbstractClass: return
    AbstractClass-->>Client: return
```

In this sequence diagram, the client calls the `templateMethod` on the abstract class, which then delegates specific operations to the concrete class.

### Knowledge Check

Before we conclude, let's reinforce the key concepts of the Template Method Pattern with a few questions:

- What is the primary purpose of the Template Method Pattern?
- How does the Template Method Pattern promote code reuse?
- What role do hook methods play in the Template Method Pattern?
