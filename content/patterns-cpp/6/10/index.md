## 6.10 Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The Strategy Pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it, promoting flexibility and reusability in code.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. By encapsulating the algorithm, the Strategy Pattern promotes the Open/Closed Principle, enabling new strategies to be added without altering existing code.

### Key Participants

1. **Strategy**: This is an interface common to all supported algorithms. The `Strategy` interface declares operations common to all supported versions of some algorithm.

2. **ConcreteStrategy**: These are classes that implement the `Strategy` interface. Each `ConcreteStrategy` implements a specific algorithm.

3. **Context**: This class maintains a reference to a `Strategy` object and is configured with a `ConcreteStrategy` object. The `Context` class interacts with the `Strategy` interface to execute an algorithm defined by a `ConcreteStrategy`.

### Applicability

Use the Strategy Pattern when:

- You have a family of algorithms and need to choose one at runtime.
- You want to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures.
- You need to replace conditional statements with polymorphism.
- You want to encapsulate algorithms in a way that allows them to be interchangeable.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's consider a simple example where we have different strategies for sorting a list of integers. We will define a `Strategy` interface, concrete strategies for different sorting algorithms, and a `Context` class to use these strategies.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Strategy Interface
class SortStrategy {
public:
    virtual ~SortStrategy() {}
    virtual void sort(std::vector<int>& data) = 0;
};

// Concrete Strategy for Bubble Sort
class BubbleSort : public SortStrategy {
public:
    void sort(std::vector<int>& data) override {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < data.size(); ++i) {
            for (size_t j = 0; j < data.size() - i - 1; ++j) {
                if (data[j] > data[j + 1]) {
                    std::swap(data[j], data[j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
};

// Concrete Strategy for Quick Sort
class QuickSort : public SortStrategy {
public:
    void sort(std::vector<int>& data) override {
        quickSort(data, 0, data.size() - 1);
    }

private:
    void quickSort(std::vector<int>& data, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(data, low, high);
            quickSort(data, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(data, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    int partition(std::vector<int>& data, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = data[high];
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
            if (data[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                std::swap(data[i], data[j]);
            }
        }
        std::swap(data[i + 1], data[high]);
        return (i + 1);
    }
};

// Context
class SortContext {
private:
    SortStrategy* strategy;

public:
    SortContext(SortStrategy* strategy) : strategy(strategy) {}

    void setStrategy(SortStrategy* strategy) {
        this->strategy = strategy;
    }

    void sortData(std::vector<int>& data) {
        strategy->sort(data);
    }
};

// Client Code
int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62};

    SortContext context(new BubbleSort());
    std::cout << "Using Bubble Sort:\n";
    context.sortData(data);
    for (int num : data) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    data = {34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62};
    context.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
    std::cout << "Using Quick Sort:\n";
    context.sortData(data);
    for (int num : data) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Design Considerations

- **Encapsulation**: The Strategy Pattern encapsulates the algorithm, allowing the client to choose which algorithm to use at runtime.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New strategies can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Polymorphism**: The Strategy Pattern uses polymorphism to switch between different algorithms.
- **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of switching strategies at runtime, especially if the strategy changes frequently.

### Differences and Similarities

The Strategy Pattern is often confused with the State Pattern. While both patterns involve changing behavior at runtime, the Strategy Pattern is used to switch between algorithms, whereas the State Pattern is used to change the behavior of an object based on its state.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

Let's use a diagram to visualize the relationships between the `Context`, `Strategy`, and `ConcreteStrategy` classes.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        -Strategy* strategy
        +setStrategy(Strategy* strategy)
        +sortData(vector<int>& data)
    }

    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        +sort(vector<int>& data)
    }

    class BubbleSort {
        +sort(vector<int>& data)
    }

    class QuickSort {
        +sort(vector<int>& data)
    }

    Context --> Strategy
    Strategy <|-- BubbleSort
    Strategy <|-- QuickSort
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by adding a new sorting strategy, such as Merge Sort. Implement the `MergeSort` class that inherits from `SortStrategy` and integrate it into the `SortContext`.
