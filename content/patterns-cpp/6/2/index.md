## 6.2 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain has the opportunity to process the request or pass it to the next handler. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects can handle a request, but the handler is not known in advance. By decoupling the sender and receiver, the Chain of Responsibility pattern promotes flexibility and reusability in your code.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. The pattern chains the receiving objects and passes the request along the chain until an object handles it.

### Key Participants

1. **Handler**: Defines an interface for handling requests. It may implement a method to set the next handler in the chain.
2. **ConcreteHandler**: Handles requests it is responsible for and can access its successor. If the ConcreteHandler can handle the request, it does so; otherwise, it forwards the request to its successor.
3. **Client**: Initiates the request to a handler in the chain.

### Applicability

Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when:
- More than one object can handle a request, and the handler is not known in advance.
- You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
- The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a practical example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in C++. We'll implement a simple logging system where different log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) are handled by different handlers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

// Abstract Handler
class Logger {
protected:
    std::shared_ptr<Logger> nextLogger;
public:
    void setNextLogger(std::shared_ptr<Logger> nextLogger) {
        this->nextLogger = nextLogger;
    }
    void logMessage(int level, const std::string& message) {
        if (this->canHandle(level)) {
            this->write(message);
        }
        if (nextLogger != nullptr) {
            nextLogger->logMessage(level, message);
        }
    }
    virtual bool canHandle(int level) = 0;
    virtual void write(const std::string& message) = 0;
};

// Concrete Handlers
class InfoLogger : public Logger {
public:
    bool canHandle(int level) override {
        return level == 1;
    }
    void write(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << "INFO: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

class DebugLogger : public Logger {
public:
    bool canHandle(int level) override {
        return level == 2;
    }
    void write(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << "DEBUG: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

class ErrorLogger : public Logger {
public:
    bool canHandle(int level) override {
        return level == 3;
    }
    void write(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << "ERROR: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

// Client code
int main() {
    auto errorLogger = std::make_shared<ErrorLogger>();
    auto debugLogger = std::make_shared<DebugLogger>();
    auto infoLogger = std::make_shared<InfoLogger>();

    infoLogger->setNextLogger(debugLogger);
    debugLogger->setNextLogger(errorLogger);

    infoLogger->logMessage(1, "This is an information.");
    infoLogger->logMessage(2, "This is a debug level information.");
    infoLogger->logMessage(3, "This is an error information.");

    return 0;
}
```

### Design Considerations

- **Flexibility**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to add or remove handlers dynamically, providing flexibility in handling requests.
- **Decoupling**: By decoupling the sender and receiver, this pattern reduces the dependency between components, making the system more modular.
- **Performance**: Be cautious of long chains, as they can lead to performance issues. Ensure that the chain is not unnecessarily long and that each handler performs its task efficiently.

### Differences and Similarities

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is often confused with the Command pattern. While both involve handling requests, the Chain of Responsibility pattern focuses on passing a request along a chain of potential handlers, whereas the Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.

### Implementing Responsibility Chains in C++

When implementing the Chain of Responsibility pattern in C++, consider the following steps:

1. **Define the Handler Interface**: Create an abstract base class or interface that defines the method for handling requests and setting the next handler in the chain.

2. **Create Concrete Handlers**: Implement concrete classes that extend the handler interface. Each concrete handler should decide whether to handle the request or pass it to the next handler.

3. **Set Up the Chain**: In the client code, create instances of the concrete handlers and link them together to form a chain.

4. **Process Requests**: Initiate the request by calling the handler method on the first handler in the chain. The request will be passed along the chain until a handler processes it.

### Avoiding Coupling Between Sender and Receiver

One of the main advantages of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is its ability to decouple the sender and receiver. This is achieved by:

- **Abstracting the Handler**: The sender only interacts with the handler interface, not the concrete handlers. This abstraction allows for flexibility in changing the chain without affecting the sender.
- **Dynamic Handler Configuration**: The chain can be configured dynamically, allowing for different handlers to be added or removed as needed without changing the sender's code.

### Visualizing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

To better understand the Chain of Responsibility pattern, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram. This diagram illustrates how a request is passed along a chain of handlers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Handler1
    participant Handler2
    participant Handler3

    Client->>Handler1: logMessage(request)
    Handler1->>Handler2: logMessage(request)
    Handler2->>Handler3: logMessage(request)
    Handler3->>Handler3: handleRequest(request)
```

**Diagram Description**: The sequence diagram shows a client sending a request to the first handler in the chain. Each handler checks if it can handle the request. If not, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain. This process continues until a handler processes the request.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code example by adding a new log level, such as WARNING. Implement a new `WarningLogger` class that handles this log level. Update the chain to include the new handler and test the functionality by logging a warning message.
