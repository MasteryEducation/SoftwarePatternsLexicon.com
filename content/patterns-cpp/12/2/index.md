## 12.2 Using Lambdas and Functional Features

In the realm of modern C++ programming, lambdas and functional features have become indispensable tools for developers seeking to write cleaner, more efficient, and expressive code. This section delves into the intricacies of using lambdas and functional features in C++, focusing on simplifying code, replacing traditional functors, and capturing state in closures. As we explore these concepts, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage these powerful tools to enhance your C++ applications.

### Introduction to Lambdas in C++

Lambdas, introduced in C++11, are anonymous functions that allow you to define function objects inline. They provide a concise way to create function objects without the need for separate class definitions, making your code more readable and maintainable.

#### What is a Lambda?

A lambda expression in C++ is a convenient way to define a small, unnamed function object. It consists of three main components:

- **Capture Clause**: Defines which variables from the surrounding scope are accessible within the lambda.
- **Parameter List**: Specifies the parameters that the lambda accepts.
- **Function Body**: Contains the code that the lambda executes.

Here's a basic example of a lambda expression:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Lambda expression to print each number
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int n) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    });

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the lambda `[](int n) { std::cout << n << " "; }` is used to print each element of the vector `numbers`.

### Simplifying Code with Lambdas

Lambdas can significantly simplify your code by reducing the need for boilerplate code associated with traditional function objects or functors. They allow you to define small, inline functions directly at the point of use, making your code more concise and easier to read.

#### Replacing Functors with Lambda Expressions

Before lambdas, functors (or function objects) were commonly used to encapsulate operations. However, functors often require additional class definitions, which can clutter your code. Lambdas provide a more streamlined alternative.

Consider the following example using a functor:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct PrintFunctor {
    void operator()(int n) const {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Using a functor to print each number
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), PrintFunctor());

    return 0;
}
```

Now, let's replace the functor with a lambda expression:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Using a lambda to print each number
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int n) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    });

    return 0;
}
```

As you can see, the lambda expression eliminates the need for a separate class definition, resulting in more concise and readable code.

### Capturing State in Closures

One of the powerful features of lambdas is their ability to capture variables from the surrounding scope, allowing them to maintain state across invocations. This capability is known as capturing state in closures.

#### Capture Modes

Lambdas can capture variables by value or by reference, depending on the capture mode specified in the capture clause:

- **Capture by Value (`[=]`)**: Copies the variables from the surrounding scope into the lambda. Modifications to these variables inside the lambda do not affect the originals.
- **Capture by Reference (`[&]`)**: Captures references to the variables from the surrounding scope. Modifications to these variables inside the lambda affect the originals.

You can also specify individual variables to capture by value or reference:

- **Capture by Value (`[x]`)**: Captures the variable `x` by value.
- **Capture by Reference (`[&x]`)**: Captures the variable `x` by reference.

Here's an example demonstrating capture modes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;

    // Lambda capturing by value
    auto captureByValue = [=]() {
        std::cout << "Capture by value: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;
    };

    // Lambda capturing by reference
    auto captureByReference = [&]() {
        std::cout << "Capture by reference: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;
    };

    // Modifying x and y
    x = 30;
    y = 40;

    captureByValue();      // Outputs: Capture by value: x = 10, y = 20
    captureByReference();  // Outputs: Capture by reference: x = 30, y = 40

    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced Lambda Features

Lambdas in C++ offer several advanced features that enhance their flexibility and usability.

#### Mutable Lambdas

By default, lambdas that capture variables by value are immutable, meaning they cannot modify the captured variables. However, you can use the `mutable` keyword to allow modifications:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;

    // Mutable lambda capturing by value
    auto mutableLambda = [x]() mutable {
        x += 5;
        std::cout << "Inside mutable lambda: x = " << x << std::endl;
    };

    mutableLambda();  // Outputs: Inside mutable lambda: x = 15
    std::cout << "Outside lambda: x = " << x << std::endl;  // Outputs: Outside lambda: x = 10

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `mutable` keyword allows the lambda to modify the captured variable `x`, but the modification does not affect the original variable outside the lambda.

#### Generic Lambdas

C++14 introduced generic lambdas, which allow you to define lambdas with template-like behavior. This feature enables lambdas to accept parameters of any type without specifying the types explicitly.

Here's an example of a generic lambda:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Generic lambda
    auto genericLambda = [](auto a, auto b) {
        return a + b;
    };

    std::cout << "Sum of integers: " << genericLambda(3, 4) << std::endl;  // Outputs: Sum of integers: 7
    std::cout << "Sum of doubles: " << genericLambda(3.5, 4.5) << std::endl;  // Outputs: Sum of doubles: 8

    return 0;
}
```

Generic lambdas provide a powerful mechanism for writing flexible and reusable code.

### Functional Features in C++

In addition to lambdas, C++ offers several functional programming features that complement the use of lambdas and enhance your ability to write expressive code.

#### std::function

The `std::function` class template provides a type-safe way to store and invoke callable objects, including lambdas, function pointers, and functors. It abstracts the details of the callable object, allowing you to use them interchangeably.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `std::function`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

void printMessage(const std::string& message) {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Using std::function to store a lambda
    std::function<void(const std::string&)> func = [](const std::string& msg) {
        std::cout << "Lambda: " << msg << std::endl;
    };

    func("Hello, World!");  // Outputs: Lambda: Hello, World!

    // Reassigning std::function to a function pointer
    func = printMessage;
    func("Hello, C++!");  // Outputs: Hello, C++!

    return 0;
}
```

The `std::function` class template provides flexibility in managing callable objects, making it a valuable tool in functional programming.

#### std::bind

The `std::bind` function template allows you to create a new function object by binding arguments to a callable object. This feature is useful for creating partial function applications and adapting functions to different interfaces.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `std::bind`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

void add(int a, int b) {
    std::cout << "Sum: " << a + b << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Binding the first argument
    auto addFive = std::bind(add, 5, std::placeholders::_1);

    addFive(10);  // Outputs: Sum: 15

    return 0;
}
```

The `std::bind` function template provides a powerful mechanism for adapting functions and creating new callable objects.

### Visualizing Lambda Expressions and Closures

To better understand how lambda expressions and closures work, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[Define Lambda]
    B --> C{Capture Clause}
    C -->|By Value| D[Copy Variables]
    C -->|By Reference| E[Reference Variables]
    D --> F[Execute Lambda]
    E --> F
    F --> G[End]
```

**Figure 1: Visualizing Lambda Expressions and Closures**

This flowchart illustrates the process of defining a lambda, capturing variables, and executing the lambda. The capture clause determines whether variables are copied or referenced, affecting how they are accessed within the lambda.

### Practical Applications of Lambdas

Lambdas are versatile tools that can be applied in various scenarios to improve code clarity and efficiency.

#### Sorting and Filtering

Lambdas are commonly used in sorting and filtering operations, where they provide a concise way to define custom comparison and filtering criteria.

Here's an example of using a lambda to sort a vector of integers in descending order:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {5, 2, 8, 1, 3};

    // Sorting in descending order using a lambda
    std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int a, int b) {
        return a > b;
    });

    for (int n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";  // Outputs: 8 5 3 2 1
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Lambdas provide a convenient way to define custom sorting and filtering logic directly at the point of use.

#### Event Handling

In event-driven programming, lambdas can be used to define event handlers inline, reducing the need for separate function definitions.

Here's an example of using a lambda as an event handler:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

class Button {
public:
    std::function<void()> onClick;

    void click() {
        if (onClick) {
            onClick();
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Button button;

    // Setting a lambda as the event handler
    button.onClick = []() {
        std::cout << "Button clicked!" << std::endl;
    };

    button.click();  // Outputs: Button clicked!

    return 0;
}
```

Lambdas provide a concise way to define event handlers, improving code readability and maintainability.
