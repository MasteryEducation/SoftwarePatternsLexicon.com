## 11.2 Ranges Library (C++20)

The C++20 Ranges Library introduces a powerful paradigm shift in how we handle collections and sequences in C++. It builds upon the Standard Template Library (STL) to provide a more expressive and flexible way to work with data. This section will delve into the core concepts of the Ranges Library, focusing on lazy evaluation, composing operations, and customizing ranges. By mastering these concepts, you can write more efficient, readable, and maintainable C++ code.

### Introduction to Ranges

The Ranges Library is a significant addition to C++20, designed to enhance the way we work with sequences of data. It aims to make code more expressive and concise by providing a set of tools to manipulate ranges of elements. A range in C++20 is an abstraction that represents a sequence of elements, similar to how iterators work but with more powerful capabilities.

#### Key Concepts

- **Range**: An abstraction representing a sequence of elements.
- **View**: A lightweight, non-owning range that can be used to transform or filter data.
- **Adaptor**: A component that modifies a range to produce a new range.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: The process of deferring computation until the result is needed, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

### Lazy Evaluation in Ranges

Lazy evaluation is a cornerstone of the Ranges Library, allowing operations to be deferred until the results are explicitly required. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex transformations.

#### How Lazy Evaluation Works

In traditional programming, operations on collections are often eager, meaning they are executed immediately. In contrast, lazy evaluation defers these operations, constructing a pipeline of transformations that are only executed when necessary.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    auto even_numbers = numbers | std::views::filter([](int n) { return n % 2 == 0; });

    for (int n : even_numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the `filter` view creates a pipeline that filters out odd numbers. However, the filtering operation is not performed until the range is iterated over in the `for` loop. This is an example of lazy evaluation, where the computation is deferred until the result is needed.

#### Benefits of Lazy Evaluation

- **Performance**: By deferring computations, you can avoid unnecessary operations, leading to faster execution times.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Lazy evaluation can reduce memory usage by not storing intermediate results.
- **Composability**: Operations can be composed into pipelines, making code more modular and easier to understand.

### Composing Operations with Ranges

One of the most powerful features of the Ranges Library is the ability to compose operations using range adaptors. This allows you to build complex data processing pipelines in a concise and readable manner.

#### Range Adaptors

Range adaptors are components that transform a range into another range. They can be chained together to form pipelines of operations. Some common adaptors include:

- **`filter`**: Filters elements based on a predicate.
- **`transform`**: Applies a function to each element.
- **`take`**: Takes the first N elements.
- **`drop`**: Drops the first N elements.

Let's see an example of composing operations using range adaptors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    auto result = numbers 
                | std::views::filter([](int n) { return n % 2 == 0; })
                | std::views::transform([](int n) { return n * n; })
                | std::views::take(3);

    for (int n : result) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we filter the even numbers, square them, and then take the first three results. The operations are composed into a single pipeline, making the code concise and expressive.

#### Visualizing Range Pipelines

To better understand how range pipelines work, let's visualize the flow of data through the pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Range] --> B[Filter Even Numbers];
    B --> C[Transform: Square];
    C --> D[Take First 3];
    D --> E[Output Range];
```

This diagram illustrates how data flows through the pipeline, with each adaptor transforming the range step by step.

### Customizing and Extending Ranges

The Ranges Library is designed to be extensible, allowing you to create custom views and adaptors to suit your specific needs.

#### Creating Custom Views

A custom view is a user-defined range that can be used to implement specialized behavior. To create a custom view, you typically define a class that models the range concept.

Here's an example of a custom view that generates a range of Fibonacci numbers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>

class FibonacciView : public std::ranges::view_interface<FibonacciView> {
    size_t count_;
    mutable size_t a_ = 0, b_ = 1;

public:
    FibonacciView(size_t count) : count_(count) {}

    auto begin() const {
        return std::ranges::subrange_iterator([this]() mutable {
            if (count_ == 0) return std::ranges::default_sentinel;
            --count_;
            auto temp = a_;
            a_ = b_;
            b_ += temp;
            return temp;
        });
    }

    auto end() const {
        return std::ranges::default_sentinel;
    }
};

int main() {
    FibonacciView fib(10);

    for (auto n : fib) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `FibonacciView` class that generates Fibonacci numbers. The view implements the `begin` and `end` methods to provide an iterator interface.

#### Extending Ranges with Custom Adaptors

Custom adaptors allow you to define new transformations that can be applied to ranges. To create a custom adaptor, you typically define a function object that takes a range and returns a new range.

Here's an example of a custom adaptor that reverses the elements of a range:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>

struct reverse_adaptor {
    template <std::ranges::viewable_range R>
    auto operator()(R&& r) const {
        return std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::rbegin(r), std::ranges::rend(r));
    }
};

inline constexpr reverse_adaptor reverse;

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    auto reversed = numbers | reverse;

    for (int n : reversed) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `reverse_adaptor` that reverses the elements of a range. We then use this adaptor in a pipeline to reverse a vector of numbers.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Ranges Library, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- **Experiment with Different Adaptors**: Try using different adaptors such as `drop`, `take_while`, or `join` to see how they affect the output.
- **Create Your Own Custom View**: Implement a custom view that generates a sequence of prime numbers.
- **Combine Multiple Pipelines**: Create a pipeline that filters, transforms, and combines multiple ranges.
