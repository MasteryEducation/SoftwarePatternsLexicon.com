## 5.1 Adapter Pattern with Type Classes and Newtypes

In the world of software design, the Adapter Pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. In Haskell, we can leverage the power of type classes and newtypes to implement this pattern effectively. This section will guide you through understanding and applying the Adapter Pattern in Haskell, focusing on type classes and newtypes.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter Pattern is to enable the integration of interfaces that are not directly compatible. In Haskell, this is achieved by defining a common interface using type classes and adapting existing types to this interface using newtypes.

### Key Concepts

- **Type Classes**: Define a set of functions that can be implemented by different types.
- **Newtypes**: Provide a way to create a distinct type from an existing one, allowing us to define new instances for type classes.

### Diagrams

To visualize the Adapter Pattern in Haskell, consider the following Mermaid.js diagram illustrating the relationship between type classes, newtypes, and existing types:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Logger {
        <<interface>>
        +logMessage(String)
    }

    class ConsoleLogger {
        +logMessage(String)
    }

    class FileLogger {
        +logMessage(String)
    }

    class ConsoleLoggerAdapter {
        +logMessage(String)
    }

    class FileLoggerAdapter {
        +logMessage(String)
    }

    Logger <|.. ConsoleLoggerAdapter
    Logger <|.. FileLoggerAdapter
    ConsoleLoggerAdapter --> ConsoleLogger
    FileLoggerAdapter --> FileLogger
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram shows how `ConsoleLoggerAdapter` and `FileLoggerAdapter` implement the `Logger` interface, adapting the `ConsoleLogger` and `FileLogger` classes, respectively.

### Key Participants

- **Target Interface**: The interface expected by the client, defined using a type class.
- **Adaptee**: The existing interface that needs adaptation.
- **Adapter**: A newtype that implements the target interface by wrapping the adaptee.

### Applicability

Use the Adapter Pattern in Haskell when:

- You need to integrate third-party libraries with incompatible interfaces.
- You want to provide a uniform interface to a set of disparate classes.
- You need to decouple the client code from specific implementations.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a practical example of adapting different logging frameworks to a standard interface using Haskell's type classes and newtypes.

#### Step 1: Define the Target Interface

First, we define a type class `Logger` that represents the common interface for logging.

```haskell
class Logger a where
    logMessage :: a -> String -> IO ()
```

#### Step 2: Define the Adaptees

Suppose we have two existing logging frameworks: `ConsoleLogger` and `FileLogger`.

```haskell
data ConsoleLogger = ConsoleLogger

consoleLog :: ConsoleLogger -> String -> IO ()
consoleLog _ msg = putStrLn ("Console: " ++ msg)

data FileLogger = FileLogger FilePath

fileLog :: FileLogger -> String -> IO ()
fileLog (FileLogger path) msg = appendFile path (msg ++ "\n")
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Adapters

We use newtypes to wrap the existing loggers and provide instances of the `Logger` type class.

```haskell
newtype ConsoleLoggerAdapter = ConsoleLoggerAdapter ConsoleLogger

instance Logger ConsoleLoggerAdapter where
    logMessage (ConsoleLoggerAdapter logger) msg = consoleLog logger msg

newtype FileLoggerAdapter = FileLoggerAdapter FileLogger

instance Logger FileLoggerAdapter where
    logMessage (FileLoggerAdapter logger) msg = fileLog logger msg
```

#### Step 4: Use the Adapters

Now, we can use the adapters to log messages through a unified interface.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let consoleLogger = ConsoleLoggerAdapter ConsoleLogger
    let fileLogger = FileLoggerAdapter (FileLogger "log.txt")
    
    logMessage consoleLogger "Logging to console"
    logMessage fileLogger "Logging to file"
```

### Design Considerations

- **Simplicity**: The Adapter Pattern simplifies client code by providing a consistent interface.
- **Flexibility**: Newtypes allow us to define multiple adapters for the same adaptee, offering flexibility in how we integrate different systems.
- **Performance**: Newtypes in Haskell are zero-cost abstractions, meaning they do not introduce runtime overhead.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's type system and functional nature provide unique advantages when implementing the Adapter Pattern:

- **Type Safety**: Type classes ensure that only compatible types can be used with the adapter.
- **Immutability**: Haskell's immutable data structures prevent side effects, making adapters more predictable.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Allows for efficient handling of potentially large or infinite data streams.

### Differences and Similarities

The Adapter Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both involve wrapping objects, the Adapter Pattern focuses on interface compatibility, whereas the Decorator Pattern adds additional behavior.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples by:

- Adding a new logging framework and creating an adapter for it.
- Modifying the `Logger` type class to include additional logging methods.
- Implementing a composite logger that logs to multiple destinations simultaneously.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

To further illustrate the Adapter Pattern, consider the following sequence diagram showing the interaction between the client, adapter, and adaptee:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Adapter
    participant Adaptee

    Client->>Adapter: logMessage("Hello, World!")
    Adapter->>Adaptee: consoleLog("Hello, World!")
    Adaptee-->>Adapter: 
    Adapter-->>Client: 
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram demonstrates how the client interacts with the adapter, which in turn delegates the logging operation to the adaptee.
