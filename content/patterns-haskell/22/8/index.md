## 22.8 Implementing IoT Systems with Haskell

The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way we interact with devices, enabling seamless communication between the physical and digital worlds. Haskell, with its strong emphasis on functional programming, offers unique advantages for developing IoT systems. In this section, we will explore how to implement IoT systems using Haskell, focusing on functional reactive programming, concurrency, and interfacing with hardware via the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

### Introduction to IoT Systems

IoT systems consist of interconnected devices that collect and exchange data. These devices, often equipped with sensors and actuators, require efficient software solutions to process data and perform actions. Haskell's functional programming paradigm, with its emphasis on immutability and pure functions, provides a robust foundation for building reliable and maintainable IoT applications.

### Patterns Applied in IoT Systems

#### Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

Functional Reactive Programming is a paradigm for working with time-varying values and event-driven systems. In the context of IoT, FRP allows us to model sensor data as continuous streams, enabling real-time processing and response to changes in the environment.

#### Concurrency

Concurrency is crucial in IoT systems to handle multiple devices and data streams simultaneously. Haskell's lightweight concurrency model, supported by Software Transactional Memory (STM) and the `async` library, allows us to manage concurrent tasks efficiently.

### Interfacing with Hardware via FFI

The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) in Haskell enables interaction with hardware components by calling functions written in other programming languages, such as C. This capability is essential for accessing low-level device APIs and libraries.

### Example: Monitoring Sensors and Actuators with Haskell

Let's delve into a practical example of implementing an IoT system using Haskell. We will create a simple application that monitors temperature sensors and controls actuators based on the sensor data.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Before we begin coding, ensure you have the Haskell Platform installed. You can use Cabal or Stack as your build tool. For this example, we'll use Stack.

```bash
# Install Stack if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

# Create a new Haskell project
stack new iot-system
cd iot-system
```

#### Step 2: Defining the Data Model

We will define a simple data model to represent sensor readings and actuator states.

```haskell
-- src/IoTModel.hs

module IoTModel where

data SensorReading = SensorReading
  { sensorId :: String
  , temperature :: Double
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

data ActuatorState = ActuatorState
  { actuatorId :: String
  , isActive :: Bool
  } deriving (Show, Eq)
```

#### Step 3: Implementing Functional Reactive Programming

We will use the `reactive-banana` library to implement FRP in our application. First, add the library to your project's dependencies.

```yaml
# stack.yaml

dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- reactive-banana
- reactive-banana-wx
```

Now, let's create a module to handle sensor data streams using FRP.

```haskell
-- src/SensorMonitor.hs

module SensorMonitor where

import IoTModel
import Reactive.Banana
import Reactive.Banana.Frameworks

-- Simulate sensor data stream
sensorDataStream :: IO (AddHandler SensorReading)
sensorDataStream = do
  (addHandler, fire) <- newAddHandler
  -- Simulate sensor data generation
  _ <- forkIO $ forever $ do
    threadDelay 1000000 -- 1 second
    fire (SensorReading "sensor1" (randomRIO (20.0, 30.0)))
  return addHandler

-- Process sensor data
processSensorData :: AddHandler SensorReading -> MomentIO ()
processSensorData addHandler = do
  eSensorReading <- fromAddHandler addHandler
  let eHighTemp = filterE (\r -> temperature r > 25.0) eSensorReading
  reactimate $ fmap (putStrLn . show) eHighTemp
```

#### Step 4: Implementing Concurrency

We will use Haskell's `async` library to handle concurrent tasks, such as reading sensor data and controlling actuators.

```haskell
-- src/ActuatorControl.hs

module ActuatorControl where

import IoTModel
import Control.Concurrent.Async

-- Simulate actuator control
controlActuator :: ActuatorState -> IO ()
controlActuator state = do
  putStrLn $ "Controlling actuator: " ++ show state
  threadDelay 500000 -- 0.5 second

-- Concurrently control multiple actuators
controlActuatorsConcurrently :: [ActuatorState] -> IO ()
controlActuatorsConcurrently states = do
  asyncs <- mapM (async . controlActuator) states
  mapM_ wait asyncs
```

#### Step 5: Interfacing with Hardware via FFI

To interface with hardware, we need to use the FFI to call functions from a C library. Let's assume we have a C library that provides functions to read sensor data and control actuators.

```c
// sensor.h

#ifndef SENSOR_H
#define SENSOR_H

double read_temperature(const char* sensor_id);
void control_actuator(const char* actuator_id, int state);

#endif // SENSOR_H
```

We can create Haskell bindings to these functions using the FFI.

```haskell
-- src/FFI.hs

{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-}

module FFI where

import Foreign.C.String
import Foreign.C.Types

foreign import ccall "sensor.h read_temperature"
  c_read_temperature :: CString -> IO CDouble

foreign import ccall "sensor.h control_actuator"
  c_control_actuator :: CString -> CInt -> IO ()
```

#### Step 6: Integrating All Components

Finally, let's integrate all components into a main application.

```haskell
-- src/Main.hs

module Main where

import IoTModel
import SensorMonitor
import ActuatorControl
import FFI
import Control.Monad

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Set up sensor data stream
  addHandler <- sensorDataStream

  -- Process sensor data
  network <- compile $ processSensorData addHandler
  actuate network

  -- Control actuators based on sensor data
  let actuators = [ActuatorState "actuator1" True, ActuatorState "actuator2" False]
  controlActuatorsConcurrently actuators

  -- Interact with hardware via FFI
  withCString "sensor1" $ \sensorId -> do
    temp <- c_read_temperature sensorId
    putStrLn $ "Temperature from FFI: " ++ show temp

  withCString "actuator1" $ \actuatorId -> do
    c_control_actuator actuatorId 1
```

### Visualizing IoT System Architecture

To better understand the architecture of our IoT system, let's visualize the components and their interactions using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Sensor] -->|Data Stream| B[Sensor Monitor]
    B -->|Event| C[Actuator Control]
    C -->|Command| D[Actuator]
    B -->|Data| E[FRP Network]
    E -->|Process| F[Main Application]
    F -->|FFI Call| G[Hardware Interface]
```

**Diagram Description:** The diagram illustrates the flow of data from sensors to the main application, highlighting the use of FRP for processing sensor data and concurrency for controlling actuators. The FFI is used to interface with hardware components.
