## 22.10 Large-Scale Distributed Systems Case Study

In this case study, we delve into the intricacies of designing and implementing large-scale distributed systems using Haskell. Our primary focus will be on leveraging Haskell's unique features and libraries, such as Cloud Haskell, to efficiently handle big data workloads. We will explore key design patterns like MapReduce, the actor model, and distributed messaging, which are essential for building scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

### Objective

The main objective of this case study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to design systems capable of processing large-scale data efficiently. We will demonstrate the application of various design patterns and Haskell-specific techniques to achieve this goal.

### Patterns Applied

1. **MapReduce**: A programming model used for processing large data sets with a distributed algorithm on a cluster.
2. **Actor Model**: A conceptual model to deal with concurrent computation, where "actors" are the universal primitives of concurrent computation.
3. **Distributed Messaging**: A method of communication between distributed systems, enabling them to exchange information and coordinate actions.

### Implementation

We will implement a distributed system using **Cloud Haskell**, a library that provides a set of abstractions for distributed computing in Haskell. Cloud Haskell allows us to build scalable and fault-tolerant applications by abstracting the complexities of distributed systems.

### References

- [Cloud Haskell](https://haskell-distributed.github.io/)

### Example: Processing Big Data Workloads Across a Cluster

#### Introduction to Cloud Haskell

Cloud Haskell is a distributed computing framework that brings Erlang-style concurrency and distribution to Haskell. It provides a set of abstractions for building distributed applications, including process management, messaging, and fault tolerance.

#### Setting Up the Environment

To get started with Cloud Haskell, ensure you have the necessary Haskell tools installed, such as GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and Cabal. You can install Cloud Haskell using Cabal:

```bash
cabal update
cabal install distributed-process
```

#### Designing the System

Let's design a system that processes large-scale data using the MapReduce pattern. Our system will consist of several components:

1. **Master Node**: Responsible for distributing tasks and collecting results.
2. **Worker Nodes**: Perform computations on data chunks and return results to the master node.
3. **Data Storage**: A distributed file system or database to store input and output data.

#### Implementing the Master Node

The master node coordinates the entire process. It divides the input data into chunks, assigns tasks to worker nodes, and aggregates the results.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import Control.Distributed.Process
import Control.Distributed.Process.Node
import Control.Monad (forM_)
import Data.Binary
import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Network.Transport.TCP (createTransport, defaultTCPParameters)

data Task = Task { taskId :: Int, taskData :: String }
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance Binary Task

data Result = Result { resultId :: Int, resultData :: String }
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance Binary Result

master :: [NodeId] -> Process ()
master workers = do
  let tasks = [Task i ("Data chunk " ++ show i) | i <- [1..10]]
  forM_ (zip tasks workers) $ \\(task, worker) -> do
    send worker task
  collectResults (length tasks)

collectResults :: Int -> Process ()
collectResults 0 = return ()
collectResults n = do
  Result _ resultData <- expect
  liftIO $ putStrLn $ "Received result: " ++ resultData
  collectResults (n - 1)
```

#### Implementing Worker Nodes

Worker nodes receive tasks from the master node, process the data, and send back the results.

```haskell
worker :: Process ()
worker = do
  Task taskId taskData <- expect
  let resultData = "Processed " ++ taskData
  send (processNodeId master) (Result taskId resultData)
```

#### Running the System

To run the system, we need to set up a network of nodes. Each node runs an instance of the Haskell runtime system, and they communicate over TCP.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  Right transport <- createTransport "127.0.0.1" "10501" defaultTCPParameters
  node <- newLocalNode transport initRemoteTable
  runProcess node $ do
    masterPid <- spawnLocal $ master [nodeId node]
    spawnLocal worker
    return ()
```

### Visualizing the System Architecture

Below is a diagram representing the architecture of our distributed system using the MapReduce pattern.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Master Node] -->|Distribute Tasks| B[Worker Node 1];
    A -->|Distribute Tasks| C[Worker Node 2];
    A -->|Distribute Tasks| D[Worker Node 3];
    B -->|Send Results| A;
    C -->|Send Results| A;
    D -->|Send Results| A;
```

**Diagram Description**: The master node distributes tasks to multiple worker nodes, which process the data and send results back to the master node.

### Key Considerations

- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure that the system can handle node failures gracefully. Cloud Haskell provides mechanisms for monitoring and restarting failed processes.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes as needed.
- **Data Distribution**: Use a distributed file system or database to store input and output data efficiently.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's strong static typing and purity make it an excellent choice for building reliable distributed systems. The use of monads and type classes allows for elegant abstractions and composability.

### Differences and Similarities

- **MapReduce vs. Actor Model**: MapReduce is a data processing pattern, while the actor model is a concurrency model. Both can be used together to build distributed systems.
- **Distributed Messaging**: This pattern is essential for communication between nodes in a distributed system, regardless of the concurrency model used.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples by modifying the number of tasks or worker nodes. Observe how the system behaves with different configurations and data sizes.
