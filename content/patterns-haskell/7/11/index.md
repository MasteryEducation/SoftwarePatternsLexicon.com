## 7.11 Partial Functions and Total Functions

In the realm of functional programming, particularly in Haskell, understanding the distinction between partial and total functions is crucial for building robust and reliable software systems. This section delves into these concepts, providing insights, examples, and best practices to help you master their application in Haskell.

### Introduction to Partial and Total Functions

#### Partial Functions

Partial functions are those that are not defined for all possible inputs of their domain. This means that for some inputs, a partial function may not return a result or may result in an error. In Haskell, common examples of partial functions include functions like `head`, `tail`, and `fromJust`, which can fail when applied to empty lists or `Nothing` values.

**Example of a Partial Function:**

```haskell
head :: [a] -> a
head (x:_) = x
head []    = error "Empty list"
```

In the example above, `head` is a partial function because it is not defined for an empty list.

#### Total Functions

Total functions, on the other hand, are defined for every possible input of their domain. They guarantee a result for any input, making them more reliable and predictable. Total functions are a hallmark of robust software design, as they eliminate runtime errors associated with undefined inputs.

**Example of a Total Function:**

```haskell
safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead (x:_) = Just x
safeHead []    = Nothing
```

Here, `safeHead` is a total function because it handles all possible inputs, including an empty list, by returning a `Maybe` type.

### Best Practices for Using Partial and Total Functions

#### Striving for Total Functions

1. **Reliability**: Total functions increase the reliability of your code by ensuring that all inputs are accounted for, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
2. **Predictability**: They make your code more predictable and easier to reason about, as they provide clear outcomes for all inputs.
3. **Maintainability**: Total functions improve maintainability by reducing the need for extensive error handling and debugging.

#### Implementing Total Functions

To convert partial functions into total functions, you can use types like `Maybe` or `Either` to handle potentially undefined cases. This approach allows you to explicitly represent the possibility of failure or absence of a value.

**Example: Safely Handling List Indexing**

```haskell
safeIndex :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
safeIndex xs i
  | i < 0 || i >= length xs = Nothing
  | otherwise               = Just (xs !! i)
```

In this example, `safeIndex` is a total function that safely handles list indexing by returning a `Maybe` type, which can be `Nothing` if the index is out of bounds.

### Code Examples and Exercises

Let's explore some code examples to solidify our understanding of partial and total functions.

#### Example 1: Converting a Partial Function to a Total Function

Consider the `fromJust` function, which is partial because it fails when given `Nothing`.

**Partial Function:**

```haskell
fromJust :: Maybe a -> a
fromJust (Just x) = x
fromJust Nothing  = error "Nothing"
```

**Total Function:**

```haskell
fromJustSafe :: Maybe a -> Either String a
fromJustSafe (Just x) = Right x
fromJustSafe Nothing  = Left "Nothing"
```

In the total version, `fromJustSafe` uses the `Either` type to handle the `Nothing` case explicitly.

#### Example 2: Handling Division Safely

Division by zero is a common source of partiality in functions. Let's create a total function for division.

**Partial Function:**

```haskell
divide :: Int -> Int -> Int
divide _ 0 = error "Division by zero"
divide x y = x `div` y
```

**Total Function:**

```haskell
safeDivide :: Int -> Int -> Either String Int
safeDivide _ 0 = Left "Division by zero"
safeDivide x y = Right (x `div` y)
```

The `safeDivide` function returns an `Either` type, providing a clear indication of failure when dividing by zero.

### Visualizing Partial and Total Functions

To better understand the concept of partial and total functions, let's visualize their behavior using a simple flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input] --> B{Is Input Valid?};
    B -->|Yes| C[Process Input];
    B -->|No| D[Return Error];
    C --> E[Return Result];
    D --> E;
```

**Description:** This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process in a total function. It checks the validity of the input and either processes it or returns an error, ensuring that all inputs are handled.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's strong static typing and type inference system make it particularly well-suited for implementing total functions. By leveraging types like `Maybe` and `Either`, you can explicitly represent the presence or absence of values, making your code more robust and expressive.

### Differences and Similarities

Partial and total functions are often confused with one another, but they serve distinct purposes. While partial functions can lead to runtime errors, total functions provide a safer and more predictable alternative. Understanding their differences is key to writing reliable Haskell code.

### Design Considerations

When designing functions in Haskell, consider the following:

- **Error Handling**: Use types like `Maybe` and `Either` to handle errors gracefully.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Haskell's type system to enforce totality and prevent runtime errors.
- **Code Clarity**: Aim for clear and concise code by using total functions, which reduce the need for extensive error handling.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored partial and total functions, try modifying the examples to handle different types of inputs or errors. Experiment with converting other partial functions into total functions using `Maybe` or `Either`.
