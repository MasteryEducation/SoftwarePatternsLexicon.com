## 7.2 Functors, Applicatives, and Monads in Design Patterns

In the realm of Haskell and functional programming, Functors, Applicatives, and Monads are foundational abstractions that enable developers to write expressive, concise, and powerful code. These abstractions are not just theoretical constructs; they are practical tools that can be applied to solve real-world problems effectively. In this section, we will delve into these abstractions, explore their roles in design patterns, and provide practical examples to illustrate their usage.

### Understanding the Hierarchy

Before we dive into the specifics of each abstraction, it's crucial to understand the hierarchy and relationships between Functors, Applicatives, and Monads.

#### Functor: Mapping Over a Context

A **Functor** is a type class that allows you to apply a function to values wrapped in a context. The primary operation of a Functor is `fmap`, which applies a function to the wrapped value without altering the context itself.

```haskell
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

**Example**: Consider a simple list as a Functor. You can map a function over each element of the list.

```haskell
-- Increment each number in the list
incrementedNumbers = fmap (+1) [1, 2, 3]  -- Result: [2, 3, 4]
```

#### Applicative: Applying Functions Within a Context

An **Applicative** builds upon Functors by allowing functions that are themselves wrapped in a context to be applied to values in a context. This is achieved through the `<*>` operator.

```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
    pure :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

**Example**: Using the `Maybe` type as an Applicative to apply a function to two `Maybe` values.

```haskell
-- Adding two Maybe Int values
addMaybes :: Maybe Int -> Maybe Int -> Maybe Int
addMaybes x y = pure (+) <*> x <*> y

result = addMaybes (Just 3) (Just 5)  -- Result: Just 8
```

#### Monad: Sequencing Computations

A **Monad** extends Applicatives by providing a way to sequence computations that may involve context-dependent effects. The key operations are `return` (or `pure`) and `>>=` (bind).

```haskell
class Applicative m => Monad m where
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

**Example**: Using the `Maybe` Monad to chain computations that may fail.

```haskell
-- Safe division using Maybe Monad
safeDiv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safeDiv _ 0 = Nothing
safeDiv x y = Just (x `div` y)

-- Chaining computations
result = Just 10 >>= \x -> safeDiv x 2 >>= \y -> safeDiv y 2
-- Result: Just 2
```

### Usage of Functors, Applicatives, and Monads

Choosing the appropriate abstraction depends on the problem requirements. Let's explore some scenarios where each abstraction shines.

#### Functors in Design Patterns

Functors are ideal when you need to apply a function to values within a context without altering the context itself. They are commonly used in scenarios where you need to transform data structures or apply operations to collections.

**Example**: Transforming a data structure using Functors.

```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)

instance Functor Tree where
    fmap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
    fmap f (Node left right) = Node (fmap f left) (fmap f right)

-- Doubling each value in the tree
tree = Node (Leaf 1) (Node (Leaf 2) (Leaf 3))
doubledTree = fmap (*2) tree
```

#### Applicatives in Design Patterns

Applicatives are useful when you have multiple computations that can be performed independently and then combined. They are particularly powerful in scenarios where you need to apply functions to multiple arguments within a context.

**Example**: Validating user input using Applicatives to collect all errors.

```haskell
data Validation e a = Failure e | Success a

instance Functor (Validation e) where
    fmap _ (Failure e) = Failure e
    fmap f (Success a) = Success (f a)

instance Monoid e => Applicative (Validation e) where
    pure = Success
    (Failure e1) <*> (Failure e2) = Failure (e1 <> e2)
    (Failure e) <*> _ = Failure e
    _ <*> (Failure e) = Failure e
    (Success f) <*> (Success a) = Success (f a)

validateName :: String -> Validation [String] String
validateName name
    | null name = Failure ["Name cannot be empty"]
    | otherwise = Success name

validateAge :: Int -> Validation [String] Int
validateAge age
    | age < 0 = Failure ["Age cannot be negative"]
    | otherwise = Success age

validateUser :: String -> Int -> Validation [String] (String, Int)
validateUser name age = (,) <$> validateName name <*> validateAge age

-- Collecting all validation errors
result = validateUser "" (-1)
-- Result: Failure ["Name cannot be empty", "Age cannot be negative"]
```

#### Monads in Design Patterns

Monads are essential when computations depend on the results of previous computations. They allow you to sequence operations that may involve side effects or context-dependent logic.

**Example**: Using Monads to handle computations with potential failure.

```haskell
-- Reading a file and processing its content
readFileContent :: FilePath -> IO (Maybe String)
readFileContent path = do
    exists <- doesFileExist path
    if exists
        then Just <$> readFile path
        else return Nothing

processFile :: FilePath -> IO (Maybe String)
processFile path = readFileContent path >>= \content ->
    return (fmap (map toUpper) content)

-- Using the Monad to chain IO operations
main :: IO ()
main = do
    result <- processFile "example.txt"
    case result of
        Just content -> putStrLn content
        Nothing -> putStrLn "File not found."
```

### Visualizing Functors, Applicatives, and Monads

To better understand the relationships and operations of Functors, Applicatives, and Monads, let's visualize these abstractions using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Functor Visualization

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Functor f a] -->|fmap (a -> b)| B[Functor f b];
```

**Caption**: Functor visualization showing the transformation of a value within a context using `fmap`.

#### Applicative Visualization

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Applicative f (a -> b)] -->|<*>| B[Applicative f a];
    B -->|<*>| C[Applicative f b];
```

**Caption**: Applicative visualization demonstrating the application of a function within a context to a value within a context.

#### Monad Visualization

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Monad m a] -->|>>= (a -> m b)| B[Monad m b];
```

**Caption**: Monad visualization illustrating the sequencing of computations using the bind operation `>>=`.

### Design Considerations

When using Functors, Applicatives, and Monads, consider the following:

- **Functor**: Use when you need to apply a function to values within a context without altering the context.
- **Applicative**: Use when you have multiple independent computations that can be combined.
- **Monad**: Use when computations depend on the results of previous computations, especially when dealing with side effects or context-dependent logic.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's type system and purity make it uniquely suited for leveraging Functors, Applicatives, and Monads. The strong static typing ensures that operations are safe and predictable, while purity allows for reasoning about code behavior without side effects.

### Differences and Similarities

While Functors, Applicatives, and Monads are related, they serve different purposes:

- **Functor**: Provides a way to map a function over a wrapped value.
- **Applicative**: Extends Functors by allowing functions within a context to be applied to values within a context.
- **Monad**: Extends Applicatives by enabling sequencing of computations with context-dependent effects.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying the functions or contexts. For instance, try adding more validation rules in the Applicative example or chaining additional computations in the Monad example. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of these powerful abstractions.

### Knowledge Check

- **Question**: What is the primary operation of a Functor?
- **Question**: How does an Applicative differ from a Functor?
- **Question**: When should you use a Monad instead of an Applicative?

### Embrace the Journey

Remember, mastering Functors, Applicatives, and Monads is a journey. These abstractions are powerful tools that can transform how you write and reason about code. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the process of becoming a more proficient Haskell developer.
