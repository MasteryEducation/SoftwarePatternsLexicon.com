## 3.12 Concurrency and Parallelism in Haskell

Concurrency and parallelism are crucial concepts in modern software development, especially for building scalable and efficient applications. Haskell, with its strong emphasis on functional programming, offers unique approaches to concurrency and parallelism. In this section, we will explore Haskell's concurrency support, parallelism techniques, and the libraries and tools available to harness these capabilities effectively.

### Concurrency Support in Haskell

Concurrency in Haskell is about dealing with multiple tasks at once, allowing them to make progress independently. Haskell provides lightweight threads and concurrency primitives that make it easier to write concurrent programs.

#### Lightweight Threads

Haskell's runtime system supports lightweight threads, also known as "green threads." These threads are managed by the Haskell runtime rather than the operating system, allowing for thousands of concurrent threads without the overhead of OS threads.

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent

main :: IO ()
main = do
    forkIO $ putStrLn "Hello from thread 1"
    forkIO $ putStrLn "Hello from thread 2"
    threadDelay 1000000  -- Wait for 1 second to let threads finish
```

In this example, `forkIO` is used to create new threads. Each thread executes a simple `putStrLn` action. The `threadDelay` function ensures the main thread waits long enough for the other threads to complete.

#### Concurrency Primitives

Haskell provides several concurrency primitives to synchronize and communicate between threads:

- **MVar**: A mutable location that can be empty or contain a value. It is used for communication between threads.

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent

main :: IO ()
main = do
    mvar <- newEmptyMVar
    forkIO $ putMVar mvar "Hello from another thread"
    message <- takeMVar mvar
    putStrLn message
```

- **STM (Software Transactional Memory)**: A composable memory transaction system that allows for safe concurrent access to shared memory.

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent.STM

main :: IO ()
main = do
    tvar <- atomically $ newTVar 0
    atomically $ modifyTVar' tvar (+1)
    value <- atomically $ readTVar tvar
    print value
```

### Parallelism Techniques

Parallelism in Haskell involves executing computations simultaneously to improve performance. Haskell's purity and laziness make it well-suited for parallel execution.

#### Strategies and Evaluation Control

Haskell provides the `Control.Parallel.Strategies` module to control evaluation strategies, allowing you to specify how computations should be evaluated in parallel.

```haskell
import Control.Parallel.Strategies

parSum :: [Int] -> Int
parSum xs = runEval $ do
    let (ys, zs) = splitAt (length xs `div` 2) xs
    sum1 <- rpar (sum ys)
    sum2 <- rpar (sum zs)
    rseq sum1
    rseq sum2
    return (sum1 + sum2)
```

In this example, `rpar` is used to evaluate parts of the list in parallel, while `rseq` ensures that the results are fully evaluated before combining them.

#### Parallel List Comprehensions

Haskell also supports parallel list comprehensions, which allow you to process lists in parallel.

```haskell
import Control.Parallel

parMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
parMap f xs = map f xs `using` parList rseq
```

The `parList` strategy evaluates each element of the list in parallel, using `rseq` to ensure each element is fully evaluated.

### Libraries and Tools

Haskell's ecosystem includes several libraries and tools to facilitate concurrency and parallelism.

#### GHC Extensions

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) provides several extensions to support concurrency and parallelism, such as:

- **Parallel Haskell**: A set of extensions for parallel programming.
- **GHC's Runtime Options**: Options to control the number of cores used for parallel execution.

#### Asynchronous Programming with `async`

The `async` library provides a higher-level abstraction for asynchronous programming, making it easier to work with concurrent tasks.

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent.Async

main :: IO ()
main = do
    a1 <- async (putStrLn "Task 1")
    a2 <- async (putStrLn "Task 2")
    wait a1
    wait a2
```

The `async` function runs an IO action in a separate thread, and `wait` blocks until the action completes.

#### Software Transactional Memory (STM)

STM provides a powerful abstraction for managing shared state in concurrent programs. It allows you to compose atomic transactions, ensuring consistency and avoiding common concurrency issues like deadlocks.

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent.STM

main :: IO ()
main = do
    tvar <- atomically $ newTVar 0
    atomically $ modifyTVar' tvar (+1)
    value <- atomically $ readTVar tvar
    print value
```

### Visualizing Concurrency and Parallelism

To better understand how concurrency and parallelism work in Haskell, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Fork Threads?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Create Lightweight Threads]
    B -->|No| D[Continue in Main Thread]
    C --> E[Execute Concurrent Tasks]
    E --> F{Synchronize?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Use MVar or STM]
    F -->|No| H[Proceed Independently]
    G --> I[End]
    H --> I
    D --> I
```

This diagram illustrates the decision-making process when working with concurrency in Haskell. It shows how threads are forked, tasks are executed, and synchronization is handled.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying them to suit your needs. Try creating more complex concurrent programs using different concurrency primitives and parallelism techniques. Consider the following challenges:

- Modify the `parSum` function to work with a larger list and measure the performance improvement.
- Implement a concurrent program that uses `STM` to manage shared state between multiple threads.
- Use the `async` library to run multiple IO actions concurrently and handle their results.
