## 3.8 API Design and Documentation with Haddock and Swagger

In the world of software development, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a crucial role in enabling different software systems to communicate with each other. In Haskell, designing and documenting APIs effectively is essential for creating robust, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. This section delves into the use of Haddock and Swagger (OpenAPI) for API design and documentation in Haskell, providing expert insights and best practices.

### Understanding Haddock

**Haddock** is a documentation-generation tool specifically designed for Haskell. It extracts documentation from annotated source code, allowing developers to create comprehensive and navigable documentation for their Haskell projects.

#### Key Features of Haddock

- **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Haddock automatically generates documentation from Haskell source code, making it easy to keep documentation up to date.
- **Hyperlinked Output**: The generated documentation includes hyperlinks, allowing users to easily navigate between different parts of the documentation.
- **Customizable Output**: Developers can customize the appearance and content of the documentation using various options and templates.

#### Using Haddock in Haskell Projects

To use Haddock in your Haskell project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Haddock**: Ensure that Haddock is installed on your system. It is typically included with the Haskell Platform.

2. **Annotate Your Code**: Add comments and annotations to your Haskell source code. Haddock uses special syntax to identify documentation comments.

   ```haskell
   -- | This function adds two numbers.
   add :: Int -> Int -> Int
   add x y = x + y
   ```

3. **Generate Documentation**: Run Haddock to generate the documentation. This can be done using the command line or integrated into your build process.

   ```bash
   haddock --html --output=docs src/MyModule.hs
   ```

4. **View the Documentation**: Open the generated HTML files in a web browser to view the documentation.

#### Best Practices for Using Haddock

- **Consistent Commenting**: Use consistent commenting styles and conventions throughout your codebase to ensure uniform documentation.
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions for functions, types, and modules to enhance the usefulness of the documentation.
- **Examples and Usage**: Include examples and usage scenarios in your documentation to help users understand how to use your API effectively.

### Introducing Swagger (OpenAPI)

**Swagger**, now known as **OpenAPI**, is a specification for describing and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a standard way to define API endpoints, request/response formats, and other API characteristics.

#### Key Features of Swagger

- **Standardized API Description**: Swagger provides a standardized format for describing APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and consume APIs.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI allows developers to interact with the API documentation, making it easier to test and explore API endpoints.
- **Code Generation**: Swagger can generate client and server code in various programming languages, reducing development time and effort.

#### Using Swagger in Haskell Projects

To use Swagger in your Haskell project, follow these steps:

1. **Define Your API**: Use the Swagger specification to define your API endpoints, request/response formats, and other details.

   ```yaml
   openapi: 3.0.0
   info:
     title: Sample API
     version: 1.0.0
   paths:
     /add:
       get:
         summary: Add two numbers
         parameters:
           - name: x
             in: query
             required: true
             schema:
               type: integer
           - name: y
             in: query
             required: true
             schema:
               type: integer
         responses:
           '200':
             description: The sum of the two numbers
             content:
               application/json:
                 schema:
                   type: integer
   ```

2. **Generate Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger UI to generate interactive documentation from your Swagger specification.

3. **Integrate with Haskell**: Use libraries like `servant-swagger` to integrate Swagger with your Haskell application.

   ```haskell
   -- Define your API using Servant
   type API = "add" :> QueryParam "x" Int :> QueryParam "y" Int :> Get '[JSON] Int

   -- Generate Swagger documentation
   apiSwagger :: Swagger
   apiSwagger = toSwagger (Proxy :: Proxy API)
   ```

4. **Serve the Documentation**: Serve the generated Swagger documentation alongside your API to provide users with easy access to the API details.

#### Best Practices for Using Swagger

- **Comprehensive API Description**: Ensure that your Swagger specification includes all necessary details about your API, including parameters, request/response formats, and error codes.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for API endpoints, parameters, and data models to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Versioning**: Include versioning information in your Swagger specification to manage changes and updates to your API over time.

### Combining Haddock and Swagger for Effective API Documentation

By combining Haddock and Swagger, you can create comprehensive and user-friendly documentation for your Haskell APIs. Haddock provides detailed documentation for your Haskell code, while Swagger offers a standardized and interactive way to describe and document your RESTful APIs.

#### Workflow for Combining Haddock and Swagger

1. **Document Haskell Code with Haddock**: Use Haddock to generate detailed documentation for your Haskell codebase, including functions, types, and modules.

2. **Define API with Swagger**: Use Swagger to define and document your API endpoints, request/response formats, and other details.

3. **Integrate Documentation**: Integrate the Haddock and Swagger documentation to provide users with a comprehensive view of your API and its implementation.

4. **Maintain Documentation**: Regularly update and maintain both Haddock and Swagger documentation to ensure accuracy and relevance.
