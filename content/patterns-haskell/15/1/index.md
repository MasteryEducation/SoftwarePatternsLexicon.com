## 15.1 Authentication and Authorization in Haskell

In the world of software development, ensuring that users are who they claim to be and that they have the appropriate permissions to access resources is crucial. This section delves into the concepts of authentication and authorization within the Haskell programming language, providing expert guidance on implementing these security measures effectively.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Before diving into implementation, it's essential to understand the core concepts:

- **Authentication**: This is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?" Common methods include passwords, tokens, and biometric data.

- **Authorization**: Once a user is authenticated, authorization determines what resources they can access and what actions they can perform. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

### Implementing Authentication in Haskell

Haskell, with its strong type system and functional paradigm, offers unique advantages for implementing secure authentication mechanisms. Let's explore some of the popular libraries and techniques used in Haskell for authentication.

#### Using `yesod-auth`

Yesod is a Haskell web framework that provides a robust authentication system through the `yesod-auth` library. This library supports various authentication methods, including username/password, OAuth, and OpenID.

**Key Features of `yesod-auth`:**

- **Pluggable Authentication**: Easily switch between different authentication methods.
- **Session Management**: Securely manage user sessions.
- **Password Hashing**: Use secure hashing algorithms to store passwords.

**Example: Implementing User Login with `yesod-auth`**

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

import Yesod
import Yesod.Auth
import Yesod.Auth.HashDB (authHashDB, HashDBUser(..), setPassword, verifyPassword)

data MyApp = MyApp

mkYesod "MyApp" [parseRoutes|
/ HomeR GET
/auth AuthR Auth getAuth
|]

instance Yesod MyApp where
    authRoute _ = Just $ AuthR LoginR

instance YesodAuth MyApp where
    type AuthId MyApp = UserId
    loginDest _ = HomeR
    logoutDest _ = HomeR
    authPlugins _ = [authHashDB (Just . UniqueUser)]

instance YesodAuthPersist MyApp

data User = User
    { userId :: UserId
    , userName :: Text
    , userPassword :: Maybe Text
    }

instance HashDBUser User where
    userPasswordHash = userPassword
    setPasswordHash h u = u { userPassword = Just h }

getHomeR :: Handler Html
getHomeR = defaultLayout [whamlet|Welcome to MyApp!|]

main :: IO ()
main = warp 3000 MyApp
```

**Explanation:**

- **Yesod Setup**: We define a basic Yesod application with routes for home and authentication.
- **Authentication Plugins**: We use `authHashDB` for username/password authentication.
- **User Model**: The `User` data type implements `HashDBUser` for password management.

#### Using `Servant.Auth`

Servant is another popular Haskell library for building web APIs. The `Servant.Auth` library provides authentication support for Servant applications.

**Key Features of `Servant.Auth`:**

- **JWT Support**: Easily implement JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
- **Basic Authentication**: Support for basic HTTP authentication.
- **Custom Authentication**: Define custom authentication schemes.

**Example: JWT Authentication with `Servant.Auth`**

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Servant
import Servant.Auth.Server
import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp (run)

type Protected = "protected" :> Get '[JSON] String
type API = Auth '[JWT] User :> Protected

data User = User { userName :: String }

instance ToJWT User
instance FromJWT User

server :: Server API
server (Authenticated user) = return $ "Hello, " ++ userName user
server _ = throwAll err401

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let jwtCfg = defaultJWTSettings myKey
        cfg = defaultCookieSettings :. jwtCfg :. EmptyContext
    run 8080 $ serveWithContext (Proxy :: Proxy API) cfg server
```

**Explanation:**

- **JWT Authentication**: We define an API with a protected route that requires JWT authentication.
- **User Data**: The `User` data type is used to represent authenticated users.
- **Server Logic**: The server responds with a personalized message for authenticated users.

### Implementing Authorization in Haskell

Authorization in Haskell can be implemented using role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC). Let's explore these concepts and how they can be applied in Haskell.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is a common authorization model where permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles. This model simplifies permission management by grouping permissions into roles.

**Example: Implementing RBAC in Haskell**

```haskell
data Role = Admin | User | Guest deriving (Eq, Show)

data Permission = Read | Write | Delete deriving (Eq, Show)

type RolePermissions = [(Role, [Permission])]

rolePermissions :: RolePermissions
rolePermissions =
    [ (Admin, [Read, Write, Delete])
    , (User, [Read, Write])
    , (Guest, [Read])
    ]

hasPermission :: Role -> Permission -> Bool
hasPermission role perm = case lookup role rolePermissions of
    Just perms -> perm `elem` perms
    Nothing -> False
```

**Explanation:**

- **Roles and Permissions**: We define roles and permissions as data types.
- **Role Permissions Mapping**: A list of roles and their associated permissions.
- **Permission Check**: The `hasPermission` function checks if a role has a specific permission.

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC is a more flexible model where access decisions are based on attributes of users, resources, and the environment. This model allows for fine-grained access control.

**Example: Implementing ABAC in Haskell**

```haskell
data Attribute = Attribute String String deriving (Eq, Show)

type Policy = [Attribute] -> Bool

userAttributes :: [Attribute]
userAttributes = [Attribute "role" "admin", Attribute "department" "IT"]

resourceAttributes :: [Attribute]
resourceAttributes = [Attribute "type" "document", Attribute "classification" "confidential"]

environmentAttributes :: [Attribute]
environmentAttributes = [Attribute "time" "office_hours"]

accessPolicy :: Policy
accessPolicy attrs =
    any (\\(Attribute key value) -> key == "role" && value == "admin") attrs

isAccessGranted :: [Attribute] -> [Attribute] -> [Attribute] -> Bool
isAccessGranted userAttrs resourceAttrs envAttrs =
    accessPolicy (userAttrs ++ resourceAttrs ++ envAttrs)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Attributes**: We define attributes as key-value pairs.
- **Policy Definition**: The `accessPolicy` function defines the access control logic.
- **Access Check**: The `isAccessGranted` function checks if access is granted based on combined attributes.

### Design Considerations

When implementing authentication and authorization in Haskell, consider the following:

- **Security**: Ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, are stored securely and transmitted over secure channels.
- **Scalability**: Design your authentication and authorization system to handle a growing number of users and permissions.
- **Usability**: Provide a seamless user experience while maintaining security.
- **Compliance**: Ensure that your implementation complies with relevant regulations and standards.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's strong type system and functional paradigm offer unique advantages for implementing authentication and authorization:

- **Type Safety**: Use Haskell's type system to enforce security constraints at compile time.
- **Immutability**: Leverage immutable data structures to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Pure Functions**: Implement pure functions for predictable and testable authentication logic.

### Differences and Similarities

Authentication and authorization are often confused but serve distinct purposes. Authentication verifies identity, while authorization determines access rights. Both are essential for securing applications, and Haskell provides robust tools and libraries to implement them effectively.

### Try It Yourself
