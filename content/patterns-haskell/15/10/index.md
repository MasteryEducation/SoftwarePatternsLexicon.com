## 15.10 Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment

In the realm of software engineering, particularly when dealing with functional programming languages like Haskell, security is a paramount concern. As systems grow in complexity, so do the potential vulnerabilities. This section delves into the essential practices of threat modeling and risk assessment, providing expert software engineers and architects with the tools to proactively identify and mitigate security risks in Haskell applications.

### Understanding Threat Modeling

**Threat Modeling** is a systematic approach to identifying and addressing potential security threats. It involves understanding the system, identifying potential threats, and determining how to mitigate them. The goal is to anticipate security issues before they manifest, allowing developers to build more secure systems from the ground up.

#### Key Concepts in Threat Modeling

1. **Assets**: Identify what needs protection. In a Haskell application, this could include data, code, and infrastructure.
2. **Threats**: Determine potential threats to these assets. This could range from unauthorized access to data breaches.
3. **Vulnerabilities**: Identify weaknesses that could be exploited by threats.
4. **Attack Vectors**: Understand the paths or methods that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities.
5. **Countermeasures**: Develop strategies to mitigate identified threats.

#### Steps in Threat Modeling

1. **Define the Scope**: Clearly outline the boundaries of the system and what needs to be protected.
2. **Identify Assets and Entry Points**: Determine what assets are critical and where potential threats could enter the system.
3. **Identify Threats**: Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to categorize potential threats.
4. **Analyze Threats**: Assess the likelihood and impact of each threat.
5. **Mitigate Threats**: Develop and implement strategies to reduce the risk of threats.

### Risk Assessment in Haskell Systems

**Risk Assessment** involves evaluating the potential impact and likelihood of identified threats. It helps prioritize which threats need immediate attention and which can be monitored over time.

#### Key Components of Risk Assessment

1. **Likelihood**: Estimate the probability of a threat occurring.
2. **Impact**: Determine the potential damage or loss if the threat is realized.
3. **Risk Level**: Calculate the risk level by combining likelihood and impact.
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Develop strategies to reduce risk to an acceptable level.

#### Performing Risk Assessment

1. **Identify Risks**: Based on the threat model, list potential risks.
2. **Analyze Risks**: Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.
3. **Prioritize Risks**: Rank risks based on their severity.
4. **Develop Mitigation Plans**: Create plans to address high-priority risks.
5. **Monitor and Review**: Continuously monitor risks and update assessments as necessary.

### Implementing Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment in Haskell

Implementing these practices in Haskell involves leveraging its unique features, such as strong static typing and pure functions, to enhance security.

#### Using Haskell's Features for Security

- **Strong Static Typing**: Use Haskell's type system to enforce security constraints and prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Immutability**: Leverage immutable data structures to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Pure Functions**: Ensure functions have no side effects, reducing the risk of unintended behavior.
- **Monads**: Use monads like `Maybe` and `Either` for safe error handling and to manage side effects securely.

#### Example: Analyzing a Web Application

Let's consider a Haskell web application and perform a basic threat modeling and risk assessment.

1. **Define the Scope**: The application handles user data and processes transactions.
2. **Identify Assets**: User data, transaction records, and authentication credentials.
3. **Identify Threats**: Unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial of service attacks.
4. **Analyze Threats**: Use STRIDE to categorize threats and assess their impact.
5. **Mitigate Threats**: Implement strong authentication, encrypt sensitive data, and use rate limiting to prevent denial of service.

#### Code Example: Secure Data Handling

```haskell
-- Define a data type for user credentials
data Credentials = Credentials {
    username :: String,
    password :: String
}

-- Function to hash passwords securely
hashPassword :: String -> IO String
hashPassword pwd = do
    -- Use a secure hashing algorithm
    hashed <- bcryptHash pwd
    return hashed

-- Function to authenticate a user
authenticateUser :: Credentials -> IO Bool
authenticateUser creds = do
    storedHash <- getStoredHash (username creds)
    return (verifyPassword (password creds) storedHash)

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let creds = Credentials "user123" "securePassword"
    isAuthenticated <- authenticateUser creds
    if isAuthenticated
        then putStrLn "Access granted"
        else putStrLn "Access denied"
```

In this example, we use Haskell's IO monad to handle side effects securely, such as hashing passwords and verifying credentials.

### Visualizing Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment

To better understand the process, let's visualize the steps involved in threat modeling and risk assessment using a flowchart.
