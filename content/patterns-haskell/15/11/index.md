## 15.11 Data Privacy and Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)

In today's digital age, data privacy and compliance are paramount for any software system handling personal data. As Haskell developers, understanding and implementing the principles of data privacy, especially in the context of regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is crucial. This section will guide you through the essential concepts, implementation strategies, and practical examples to ensure your Haskell applications are compliant with these regulations.

### Understanding GDPR and HIPAA

#### GDPR Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law in the European Union (EU) that governs how organizations handle personal data. Key principles include:

- **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: Data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently.
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data should be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.
- **Data Minimization**: Only data necessary for the intended purpose should be collected.
- **Accuracy**: Data must be accurate and kept up to date.
- **Storage Limitation**: Data should be kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary.
- **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Data must be processed securely to prevent unauthorized access or processing.

#### HIPAA Overview

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US law designed to protect sensitive patient health information. Key components include:

- **Privacy Rule**: Establishes standards for the protection of health information.
- **Security Rule**: Sets standards for securing electronic protected health information (ePHI).
- **Breach Notification Rule**: Requires covered entities to notify affected individuals of a data breach.

### Implementing Data Privacy in Haskell

To ensure compliance with GDPR and HIPAA, Haskell applications must incorporate several key practices:

#### Data Encryption

Encrypting sensitive data is a fundamental requirement. Haskell provides libraries such as `cryptonite` for implementing encryption.

```haskell
import Crypto.Cipher.AES (AES256)
import Crypto.Cipher.Types (cipherInit, ecbEncrypt, ecbDecrypt)
import Crypto.Error (CryptoFailable(..))

-- Example of encrypting data using AES256
encryptData :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Either String ByteString
encryptData key plaintext = 
    case cipherInit key of
        CryptoFailed err -> Left (show err)
        CryptoPassed cipher -> Right (ecbEncrypt cipher plaintext)

-- Example of decrypting data
decryptData :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Either String ByteString
decryptData key ciphertext = 
    case cipherInit key of
        CryptoFailed err -> Left (show err)
        CryptoPassed cipher -> Right (ecbDecrypt cipher ciphertext)
```

#### Data Anonymization

Anonymizing data involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) to protect user privacy. This can be achieved by using techniques like hashing or pseudonymization.

```haskell
import Crypto.Hash (hash, Digest, SHA256)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BS

-- Example of hashing data for anonymization
anonymizeData :: String -> Digest SHA256
anonymizeData = hash . BS.pack
```

#### User Consent Management

GDPR requires explicit consent from users for data processing. Implementing a consent management system involves tracking user consent and ensuring data processing aligns with the given consent.

```haskell
data UserConsent = UserConsent
    { userId :: Int
    , consentGiven :: Bool
    , consentTimestamp :: UTCTime
    }

-- Function to update user consent
updateUserConsent :: Int -> Bool -> IO ()
updateUserConsent userId consent = do
    currentTime <- getCurrentTime
    let newConsent = UserConsent userId consent currentTime
    -- Save newConsent to database or data store
```

#### Data Deletion and Right to be Forgotten

GDPR grants users the right to request data deletion. Implementing this involves providing mechanisms to delete user data upon request.

```haskell
-- Function to delete user data
deleteUserData :: Int -> IO ()
deleteUserData userId = do
    -- Logic to delete user data from database
    putStrLn $ "User data for user ID " ++ show userId ++ " has been deleted."
```

### Ensuring Compliance with Haskell

#### Auditing and Logging

Maintaining logs of data access and processing activities is essential for compliance. Haskell's `fast-logger` library can be used for efficient logging.

```haskell
import System.Log.FastLogger

-- Example of setting up a logger
setupLogger :: IO LoggerSet
setupLogger = newStdoutLoggerSet defaultBufSize

-- Function to log data access
logDataAccess :: LoggerSet -> String -> IO ()
logDataAccess loggerSet message = do
    time <- getCurrentTime
    pushLogStrLn loggerSet (toLogStr $ show time ++ " - " ++ message)
```

#### Regular Security Audits

Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security standards. This involves reviewing code, configurations, and access controls.

#### Training and Awareness

Ensure that all team members are aware of data privacy regulations and best practices. Regular training sessions can help maintain compliance and prevent data breaches.

### Visualizing Data Privacy Implementation

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of data privacy implementation in a Haskell application:
