## 15.5 Input Validation and Sanitization

In the realm of software development, ensuring the security and integrity of applications is paramount. Input validation and sanitization are critical components in safeguarding applications against malicious attacks, such as injection attacks, which can compromise data and system integrity. In this section, we will delve into the importance of input validation and sanitization, explore various techniques for implementing these practices in Haskell, and provide practical examples to illustrate these concepts.

### Importance of Input Validation and Sanitization

Input validation and sanitization are essential for several reasons:

- **Preventing Injection Attacks**: Injection attacks, such as SQL injection and command injection, occur when untrusted input is executed as part of a command or query. Proper validation and sanitization can prevent these attacks by ensuring that input is safe to use.
- **Ensuring Data Integrity**: By validating input, we can ensure that the data conforms to expected formats and constraints, reducing the risk of data corruption.
- **Enhancing User Experience**: Validating input can provide immediate feedback to users, helping them correct errors and submit valid data.
- **Compliance with Security Standards**: Many security standards and regulations require input validation as part of their compliance criteria.

### Implementation Strategies

Implementing input validation and sanitization in Haskell involves several strategies:

1. **Validating Data Formats**: Ensure that input data matches expected formats using regular expressions or custom validation functions.
2. **Escaping Special Characters**: Prevent injection attacks by escaping special characters in input data.
3. **Using Type Systems**: Leverage Haskell's strong type system to enforce data constraints at compile time.
4. **Sanitizing Input**: Remove or encode potentially harmful characters from input data.
5. **Utilizing Libraries**: Use existing libraries and frameworks that provide built-in validation and sanitization functions.

### Validating Data Formats

Validating data formats is the first line of defense against invalid input. In Haskell, we can use pattern matching, regular expressions, and custom validation functions to ensure that input data conforms to expected formats.

#### Example: Validating Email Addresses

Let's consider an example of validating email addresses in a Haskell application. We can use regular expressions to check if an input string is a valid email address.

```haskell
import Text.Regex.Posix ((=~))

-- Function to validate email addresses
isValidEmail :: String -> Bool
isValidEmail email = email =~ "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let email1 = "example@example.com"
    let email2 = "invalid-email"
    putStrLn $ "Is " ++ email1 ++ " a valid email? " ++ show (isValidEmail email1)
    putStrLn $ "Is " ++ email2 ++ " a valid email? " ++ show (isValidEmail email2)
```

In this example, we use a regular expression to validate email addresses. The `isValidEmail` function returns `True` if the input string matches the email pattern and `False` otherwise.

### Escaping Special Characters

Escaping special characters is crucial to prevent injection attacks. In Haskell, we can use libraries to escape characters in input data.

#### Example: Escaping SQL Queries

When dealing with SQL databases, it's important to escape special characters in user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.

```haskell
import Database.HDBC
import Database.HDBC.Sqlite3 (connectSqlite3)

-- Function to escape SQL input
escapeSqlInput :: String -> String
escapeSqlInput = concatMap escapeChar
  where
    escapeChar '\'' = "''"
    escapeChar c    = [c]

main :: IO ()
main = do
    conn <- connectSqlite3 "example.db"
    let userInput = "O'Reilly"
    let escapedInput = escapeSqlInput userInput
    let query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name = '" ++ escapedInput ++ "'"
    putStrLn $ "Executing query: " ++ query
    -- Execute the query using the database connection
    -- ...
```

In this example, we define a function `escapeSqlInput` that escapes single quotes in SQL input by replacing them with two single quotes. This prevents SQL injection by ensuring that user input is treated as a literal string.

### Using Type Systems

Haskell's strong type system can be leveraged to enforce data constraints at compile time, reducing the risk of invalid input.

#### Example: Using Newtypes for Validation

We can use Haskell's `newtype` feature to create distinct types for validated input, ensuring that only valid data is used in our application.

```haskell
newtype Email = Email String deriving (Show)

-- Function to create a validated Email
mkEmail :: String -> Maybe Email
mkEmail email
    | isValidEmail email = Just (Email email)
    | otherwise          = Nothing

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let email1 = "example@example.com"
    let email2 = "invalid-email"
    case mkEmail email1 of
        Just validEmail -> putStrLn $ "Valid email: " ++ show validEmail
        Nothing         -> putStrLn "Invalid email"
    case mkEmail email2 of
        Just validEmail -> putStrLn $ "Valid email: " ++ show validEmail
        Nothing         -> putStrLn "Invalid email"
```

In this example, we define a `newtype` `Email` to represent validated email addresses. The `mkEmail` function returns a `Maybe Email`, indicating whether the input string is a valid email address.

### Sanitizing Input

Sanitizing input involves removing or encoding potentially harmful characters from input data. This is especially important when dealing with HTML or XML data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

#### Example: Sanitizing HTML Input

We can use libraries like `blaze-html` to sanitize HTML input in Haskell applications.

```haskell
import Text.Blaze.Html
import Text.Blaze.Html.Renderer.String (renderHtml)
import Text.Blaze.Html5 as H
import Text.Blaze.Html5.Attributes as A

-- Function to sanitize HTML input
sanitizeHtml :: String -> Html
sanitizeHtml input = H.p (H.toHtml input)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let userInput = "<script>alert('XSS');</script>"
    let sanitizedHtml = sanitizeHtml userInput
    putStrLn $ "Sanitized HTML: " ++ renderHtml sanitizedHtml
```

In this example, we use the `blaze-html` library to sanitize HTML input by converting it to a safe HTML representation. The `sanitizeHtml` function wraps the input in a paragraph tag, escaping any potentially harmful characters.

### Utilizing Libraries

Haskell offers several libraries that provide built-in validation and sanitization functions. These libraries can simplify the implementation of input validation and sanitization in your applications.

#### Example: Using `aeson` for JSON Validation

The `aeson` library provides tools for parsing and validating JSON data in Haskell applications.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Data.Aeson
import Data.Text (Text)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as B

-- Define a data type for user input
data UserInput = UserInput
    { username :: Text
    , email    :: Text
    } deriving (Show)

instance FromJSON UserInput where
    parseJSON = withObject "UserInput" $ \v -> UserInput
        <$> v .: "username"
        <*> v .: "email"

-- Function to validate JSON input
validateJsonInput :: B.ByteString -> Either String UserInput
validateJsonInput input = eitherDecode input

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let jsonInput = "{\"username\": \"john_doe\", \"email\": \"john@example.com\"}"
    case validateJsonInput (B.pack jsonInput) of
        Right userInput -> putStrLn $ "Valid input: " ++ show userInput
        Left err        -> putStrLn $ "Invalid input: " ++ err
```

In this example, we define a `UserInput` data type and implement the `FromJSON` instance to parse JSON input. The `validateJsonInput` function uses `eitherDecode` to validate the JSON input and return a `UserInput` object if the input is valid.

### Visualizing Input Validation and Sanitization

To better understand the process of input validation and sanitization, let's visualize the workflow using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Receive Input]
    B --> C{Is Input Valid?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Sanitize Input]
    C -->|No| E[Reject Input]
    D --> F[Process Input]
    E --> G[Return Error]
    F --> H[End]
    G --> H
```

**Figure 1**: This flowchart illustrates the process of input validation and sanitization. Input is first validated, and if valid, it is sanitized before being processed. Invalid input is rejected with an error message.
