## 13.4 Calling Haskell from Other Languages

In the world of software development, interoperability is key to leveraging the strengths of different programming languages. Haskell, known for its strong type system and functional programming paradigm, can be integrated with other languages to create powerful, efficient, and maintainable systems. In this section, we will explore how to call Haskell functions from other languages such as C and Python, using Foreign Function Interface (FFI), shared libraries, and bindings.

### Interfacing from Other Languages

Interfacing Haskell with other languages involves exposing Haskell functions so that they can be called from languages like C, Python, and others. This process is crucial for integrating Haskell into existing systems or leveraging Haskell's capabilities in a multi-language environment.

#### Exposing Haskell Functions

To expose Haskell functions to other languages, we need to:

1. **Define the Haskell Functions**: Write the functions in Haskell that you want to expose.
2. **Use FFI to Export Functions**: Utilize Haskell's Foreign Function Interface to make these functions available to other languages.
3. **Create Bindings**: Develop bindings in the target language to call the exported Haskell functions.

### Implementation

The implementation of calling Haskell from other languages involves several steps, including using FFI exports and creating bindings.

#### Using FFI Exports

Haskell's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) allows Haskell code to call, and be called by, foreign languages. Here's how you can use FFI to export Haskell functions:

1. **Define Foreign Export**: Use the `foreign export` keyword to specify which Haskell functions should be accessible from other languages.

   ```haskell
   {-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-}

   module MyModule where

   import Foreign.C.Types

   -- A simple Haskell function to add two integers
   add :: CInt -> CInt -> CInt
   add x y = x + y

   -- Export the function to be accessible from C
   foreign export ccall add :: CInt -> CInt -> CInt
   ```

2. **Compile the Haskell Code**: Compile the Haskell code into a shared library or dynamic link library (DLL) that can be linked with other languages.

   ```bash
   ghc -shared -o libmymodule.so MyModule.hs
   ```

3. **Create Bindings in the Target Language**: Write code in the target language to load the shared library and call the exported functions.

#### Creating Bindings

Bindings are necessary to call the exported Haskell functions from the target language. Let's see how to create bindings in C and Python.

##### C Bindings

To call the exported Haskell function from C, you need to:

1. **Include the Necessary Headers**: Use the appropriate headers to load the shared library.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <dlfcn.h>

   typedef int (*add_func)(int, int);

   int main() {
       void *handle = dlopen("./libmymodule.so", RTLD_LAZY);
       if (!handle) {
           fprintf(stderr, "Error loading library: %s\n", dlerror());
           return 1;
       }

       add_func add = (add_func) dlsym(handle, "add");
       if (!add) {
           fprintf(stderr, "Error loading function: %s\n", dlerror());
           return 1;
       }

       int result = add(3, 4);
       printf("Result of add(3, 4): %d\n", result);

       dlclose(handle);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Compile and Run the C Code**: Compile the C code and link it with the shared library.

   ```bash
   gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -ldl
   ./myprogram
   ```

##### Python Bindings

To call the exported Haskell function from Python, you can use the `ctypes` library:

1. **Load the Shared Library**: Use `ctypes` to load the shared library.

   ```python
   import ctypes

   # Load the shared library
   lib = ctypes.CDLL('./libmymodule.so')

   # Define the argument and return types of the function
   lib.add.argtypes = [ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int]
   lib.add.restype = ctypes.c_int

   # Call the function
   result = lib.add(3, 4)
   print(f"Result of add(3, 4): {result}")
   ```

2. **Run the Python Code**: Execute the Python script to see the result.

   ```bash
   python myscript.py
   ```

### Example: Providing a Haskell Library as a Shared Object or DLL

Let's walk through a complete example of providing a Haskell library as a shared object or DLL.

#### Step 1: Write Haskell Code

Create a Haskell module with the functions you want to expose.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-}

module MathLib where

import Foreign.C.Types

-- A function to multiply two integers
multiply :: CInt -> CInt -> CInt
multiply x y = x * y

-- Export the function
foreign export ccall multiply :: CInt -> CInt -> CInt
```

#### Step 2: Compile the Haskell Code

Compile the Haskell code into a shared library.

```bash
ghc -shared -o libmathlib.so MathLib.hs
```

#### Step 3: Create C Bindings

Write a C program to use the shared library.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

typedef int (*multiply_func)(int, int);

int main() {
    void *handle = dlopen("./libmathlib.so", RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error loading library: %s\n", dlerror());
        return 1;
    }

    multiply_func multiply = (multiply_func) dlsym(handle, "multiply");
    if (!multiply) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error loading function: %s\n", dlerror());
        return 1;
    }

    int result = multiply(6, 7);
    printf("Result of multiply(6, 7): %d\n", result);

    dlclose(handle);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run the C program.

```bash
gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -ldl
./myprogram
```

#### Step 4: Create Python Bindings

Write a Python script to use the shared library.

```python
import ctypes

# Load the shared library
lib = ctypes.CDLL('./libmathlib.so')

# Define the argument and return types of the function
lib.multiply.argtypes = [ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int]
lib.multiply.restype = ctypes.c_int

# Call the function
result = lib.multiply(6, 7)
print(f"Result of multiply(6, 7): {result}")
```

Run the Python script.

```bash
python myscript.py
```

### Visualizing the Process

To better understand the process of calling Haskell from other languages, let's visualize the workflow using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Haskell
    participant SharedLibrary
    participant CProgram
    participant PythonScript

    Haskell->>SharedLibrary: Compile to shared object (libmathlib.so)
    CProgram->>SharedLibrary: Load library
    CProgram->>SharedLibrary: Call multiply function
    SharedLibrary-->>CProgram: Return result
    PythonScript->>SharedLibrary: Load library
    PythonScript->>SharedLibrary: Call multiply function
    SharedLibrary-->>PythonScript: Return result
```

### Design Considerations

When calling Haskell from other languages, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Ensure that the overhead of calling Haskell functions from other languages is acceptable for your use case.
- **Type Safety**: Be cautious with type conversions between Haskell and the target language to avoid runtime errors.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues when interfacing between languages.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's strong type system and lazy evaluation can be leveraged when integrating with other languages. However, be mindful of the differences in memory management and execution models between Haskell and imperative languages.

### Differences and Similarities

While Haskell's FFI is similar to other languages' FFIs, Haskell's type system and purity introduce unique challenges and opportunities. Unlike languages with mutable state, Haskell's immutability requires careful consideration when interfacing with stateful systems.
