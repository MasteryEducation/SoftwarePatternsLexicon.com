## 21.13 Designing for Accessibility

Designing for accessibility is a crucial aspect of software development that ensures applications are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. In this section, we will explore how to design accessible Haskell applications, focusing on web applications, but also touching on general software accessibility principles. We will cover accessibility goals, standards, implementation strategies, and provide practical examples.

### Accessibility Goals

The primary goal of accessibility is to make software usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This involves:

- **Ensuring Compatibility with Assistive Technologies**: Such as screen readers, magnifiers, and alternative input devices.
- **Providing Alternative Text for Non-Text Content**: Ensuring that images, videos, and other non-text content are accessible.
- **Designing for Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring that all functionality is accessible via keyboard.
- **Maintaining Readability and Understandability**: Using clear language and providing instructions and feedback.

### Accessibility Standards

To achieve these goals, developers should adhere to established accessibility standards, such as:

- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: A set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content more accessible.
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: A set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

#### Key WCAG Principles

The WCAG guidelines are organized around four principles, often abbreviated as POUR:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Implementing Accessibility in Haskell Applications

Implementing accessibility in Haskell applications, particularly web applications, involves several strategies:

#### Semantic HTML and ARIA

Using semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes is crucial for creating accessible web applications. Semantic HTML provides meaning to the web content, while ARIA attributes enhance accessibility by providing additional information to assistive technologies.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Lucid

-- Example of a semantic HTML form with ARIA attributes
myForm :: Html ()
myForm = form_ [role_ "form", ariaLabel_ "User Information Form"] $ do
  label_ [for_ "name"] "Name:"
  input_ [type_ "text", id_ "name", name_ "name", ariaRequired_ "true"]
  label_ [for_ "email"] "Email:"
  input_ [type_ "email", id_ "email", name_ "email", ariaRequired_ "true"]
  button_ [type_ "submit"] "Submit"
```

In this example, we use the `Lucid` library to generate HTML with semantic elements and ARIA attributes. The `role_` and `ariaLabel_` attributes provide additional context for assistive technologies.

#### Keyboard Navigation

Ensuring that all functionality is accessible via keyboard is essential for users who cannot use a mouse. This involves:

- **Providing Logical Tab Order**: Ensuring that the tab order follows the visual order.
- **Using `tabindex`**: To control the tab order and make non-interactive elements focusable.
- **Handling Keyboard Events**: To provide keyboard shortcuts and ensure all interactive elements are accessible.

```haskell
-- Example of handling keyboard events in a Haskell web application
handleKeyPress :: Event -> IO ()
handleKeyPress event = do
  let key = eventKey event
  when (key == "Enter") $ putStrLn "Enter key pressed!"
```

#### Color Contrast and Text Readability

Ensuring sufficient color contrast and text readability is crucial for users with visual impairments. Use tools to check color contrast ratios and ensure they meet WCAG standards.

#### Providing Alternative Text

All non-text content, such as images and videos, should have alternative text descriptions. This can be achieved using the `alt` attribute for images and providing transcripts or captions for videos.

```haskell
-- Example of an image with alternative text
imageWithAlt :: Html ()
imageWithAlt = img_ [src_ "logo.png", alt_ "Company Logo"]
```

### Example: Developing an Accessible Web Application

Let's develop a simple web application using Haskell that is accessible via screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Setting Up the Project

First, create a new Haskell project using `stack`:

```bash
stack new accessible-web-app
cd accessible-web-app
```

Add the `Lucid` library to your `package.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- lucid
```

#### Creating the Main Application

Create a file `Main.hs` and add the following code:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Lucid
import Web.Scotty

main :: IO ()
main = scotty 3000 $ do
  get "/" $ html $ renderText myPage

myPage :: Html ()
myPage = doctypehtml_ $ do
  head_ $ do
    title_ "Accessible Web App"
    meta_ [charset_ "utf-8"]
  body_ $ do
    h1_ "Welcome to the Accessible Web App"
    myForm
    p_ "Use the tab key to navigate through the form."
```

#### Running the Application

Run the application using `stack`:

```bash
stack build
stack exec accessible-web-app
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the accessible web application in action.

### Try It Yourself

Encourage experimentation by suggesting modifications to the code examples. Try adding more form fields, using different ARIA roles, or implementing additional keyboard shortcuts.

### Visualizing Accessibility Concepts

To better understand the relationship between HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and assistive technologies, let's visualize the structure of an accessible web page.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[HTML Document] --> B[Semantic Elements];
  A --> C[ARIA Attributes];
  B --> D[Screen Readers];
  C --> D;
  D --> E[User Interaction];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates how semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes work together to enhance accessibility for screen readers, ultimately improving user interaction.
