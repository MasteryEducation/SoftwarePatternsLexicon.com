## 21.7 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Nix and Terraform

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a transformative approach to managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This section explores how to leverage Nix and Terraform to manage Haskell project dependencies and define cloud infrastructure.

### Understanding IaC Principles

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice that enables teams to manage infrastructure with the same rigor as application code. The main principles of IaC include:

- **Version Control**: Infrastructure configurations are stored in version control systems, enabling tracking of changes and collaboration.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that environments can be recreated consistently across different stages of development and production.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual intervention by automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates scaling of infrastructure by automating the deployment of additional resources.

### Nix: A Purely Functional Package Manager

Nix is a powerful package manager and build system that uses a purely functional approach to manage software dependencies. It is particularly well-suited for Haskell projects due to its emphasis on immutability and reproducibility.

#### Key Features of Nix

- **Immutability**: Packages are stored in a read-only store, ensuring that builds are reproducible and isolated.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Nix expressions describe the desired state of the system, making it easy to reproduce environments.
- **Dependency Management**: Nix can manage dependencies for Haskell projects, ensuring that the correct versions of libraries are used.

#### Managing Haskell Project Dependencies with Nix

To manage Haskell project dependencies with Nix, you can create a `default.nix` file that specifies the dependencies and build instructions. Here's an example:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.haskellPackages.callCabal2nix "my-haskell-project" ./. {}
```

This Nix expression imports the Nix package collection and uses `callCabal2nix` to generate a Nix build expression for the Haskell project located in the current directory.

### Terraform: Declarative Infrastructure Provisioning

Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. It is widely used for managing cloud infrastructure due to its support for various providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

#### Key Features of Terraform

- **Declarative Configuration**: Infrastructure is defined using a declarative language, allowing you to specify the desired state.
- **State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file to track the current state of infrastructure, enabling incremental updates.
- **Provider Ecosystem**: Supports a wide range of cloud providers and services, making it versatile for different environments.

#### Defining Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform

To define cloud infrastructure with Terraform, you create configuration files using the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Here's a simple example of a Terraform configuration for deploying an AWS EC2 instance:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```

This configuration specifies the AWS provider and defines an EC2 instance resource with a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.

### Implementing IaC with Nix and Terraform

Combining Nix and Terraform allows you to manage both software dependencies and infrastructure in a consistent and reproducible manner. Here's how you can implement IaC for a Haskell project:

#### Step 1: Set Up Nix for Dependency Management

1. **Install Nix**: Follow the [Nix installation guide](https://nixos.org/download.html) to install Nix on your system.
2. **Create a `default.nix` File**: Define your Haskell project dependencies using Nix expressions.
3. **Build the Project**: Use the `nix-build` command to build your Haskell project with the specified dependencies.

#### Step 2: Define Infrastructure with Terraform

1. **Install Terraform**: Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. **Create Terraform Configuration Files**: Define your infrastructure using HCL in `.tf` files.
3. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
4. **Apply the Configuration**: Use `terraform apply` to provision the defined infrastructure.

#### Step 3: Integrate Nix and Terraform

- **Use Nix to Manage Terraform Dependencies**: Create a `shell.nix` file to specify the Terraform version and dependencies required for your project.
- **Automate Infrastructure Provisioning**: Write scripts to automate the execution of Nix and Terraform commands, ensuring a seamless workflow.

### Example: Setting Up a Replicable Development Environment

Let's walk through an example of setting up a development environment for a Haskell project using Nix and Terraform.

#### Step 1: Define Haskell Dependencies with Nix

Create a `default.nix` file for your Haskell project:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.haskellPackages.callCabal2nix "my-haskell-project" ./. {}
```

#### Step 2: Define Infrastructure with Terraform

Create a `main.tf` file to define the infrastructure:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Integrate and Automate

Create a `shell.nix` file to manage Terraform dependencies:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [ pkgs.terraform ];
}
```

Write a script to automate the setup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Enter the Nix shell
nix-shell

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Apply the Terraform configuration
terraform apply
```
