## 21.17 Code Style Guidelines (e.g., HLint)

In the realm of software development, especially in functional programming with Haskell, maintaining a consistent code style is paramount. It not only enhances readability and maintainability but also fosters collaboration among developers. This section delves into the intricacies of Haskell code style guidelines, emphasizing the role of tools like HLint in achieving code consistency.

### Consistency in Code Style

Consistency in code style is crucial for several reasons. It reduces cognitive load, making it easier for developers to understand and navigate codebases. It also minimizes errors and facilitates easier code reviews and maintenance. Let's explore some key guidelines to achieve consistency in Haskell code.

#### Naming Conventions

Adopting a consistent naming convention is the first step towards a readable codebase. In Haskell, the following conventions are widely accepted:

- **Functions and Variables**: Use camelCase for naming functions and variables. For example, `calculateSum`, `userName`.
- **Types and Constructors**: Use PascalCase for naming types and constructors. For example, `UserProfile`, `OrderStatus`.
- **Modules**: Use PascalCase for module names, reflecting the directory structure. For example, `Data.List`, `Network.HTTP`.

#### Indentation and Formatting

Proper indentation and formatting are essential for readability. Haskell's syntax relies heavily on indentation, making it crucial to follow these guidelines:

- **Indentation**: Use spaces instead of tabs, typically two or four spaces per indentation level.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters to enhance readability across different devices and editors.
- **Alignment**: Align related code elements vertically to improve visual structure.

#### Module Structure

Organizing modules effectively is key to maintaining a clean codebase. Consider the following practices:

- **Exports**: Explicitly list exported functions and types to control module interfaces.
- **Imports**: Group imports logically, separating standard library imports from third-party and local imports.
- **Documentation**: Include module-level documentation to describe the purpose and usage of the module.

### Tools for Code Style: HLint

HLint is a powerful tool for suggesting improvements to Haskell code. It analyzes code for potential issues and provides style suggestions, helping developers adhere to best practices.

#### Installing HLint

To install HLint, use the following command:

```bash
cabal update
cabal install hlint
```

Alternatively, if you're using Stack:

```bash
stack install hlint
```

#### Running HLint

Once installed, you can run HLint on your Haskell files or projects:

```bash
hlint src/
```

This command will analyze all Haskell files in the `src` directory and provide suggestions for improvements.

#### Customizing HLint

HLint can be customized to suit your project's specific style guidelines. Create an `.hlint.yaml` file in your project root to override default settings:

```yaml
- ignore: {name: "Use camelCase"}
- warn: {name: "Use let"}
```

This configuration ignores suggestions for camelCase and adds a warning for using `let`.

### Implementation of Community-Accepted Style Guides

Applying community-accepted style guides ensures that your code aligns with industry standards. The [Haskell Style Guide](https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide) is a widely recognized resource that provides comprehensive guidelines for Haskell code.

#### Key Recommendations

- **Use of Language Extensions**: Enable language extensions explicitly in the source file using `{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}` pragmas.
- **Type Annotations**: Provide type annotations for top-level functions to improve code clarity and facilitate type inference.
- **Avoiding Partial Functions**: Avoid using partial functions like `head` and `tail` without checks. Use safe alternatives like `headMay` from the `safe` package.

### Code Examples

Let's explore some code examples that demonstrate these guidelines in action.

#### Example 1: Naming Conventions

```haskell
-- Define a data type using PascalCase
data UserProfile = UserProfile
  { userName :: String  -- Use camelCase for fields
  , userAge  :: Int
  }

-- Define a function using camelCase
calculateAge :: UserProfile -> Int
calculateAge profile = userAge profile
```

#### Example 2: Indentation and Formatting

```haskell
-- Proper indentation and alignment
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList xs = sum xs

-- Aligning related elements
addNumbers :: Int -> Int -> Int
addNumbers x y =
  let result = x + y
  in result
```

#### Example 3: Module Structure

```haskell
-- Module declaration with explicit exports
module Data.UserProfile
  ( UserProfile(..)
  , calculateAge
  ) where

-- Importing standard and third-party libraries
import Data.List (sort)
import Control.Monad (when)
```

### Visualizing Code Style Guidelines
