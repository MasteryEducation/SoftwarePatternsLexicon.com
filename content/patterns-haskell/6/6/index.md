## 6.6 Memento Pattern with Immutable Data Structures

In this section, we delve into the Memento Pattern, a behavioral design pattern that allows capturing and restoring an object's state without violating encapsulation. In Haskell, we leverage immutable data structures to naturally preserve previous states, making it an ideal language for implementing this pattern. We will explore how to implement the Memento Pattern in Haskell, focusing on an example of an undo feature in a text editor.

### Memento Concept

The Memento Pattern is designed to capture an object's internal state so that it can be restored later. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo/redo functionality, such as in text editors or drawing applications. The key challenge is to achieve this without exposing the internal details of the object, thus maintaining encapsulation.

#### Key Participants

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. **Memento**: A representation of the Originator's state at a particular point in time.
3. **Caretaker**: Manages the mementos and is responsible for storing and restoring the Originator's state.

### Implementation in Haskell

Haskell's immutable data structures provide a natural fit for the Memento Pattern. Since data is immutable, previous states are inherently preserved, allowing us to capture snapshots of an object's state efficiently.

#### Leveraging Immutable Data Structures

In Haskell, we can represent the state of an object using immutable data structures, such as records or algebraic data types. These structures allow us to create snapshots of the state without the need for explicit copying or cloning, as is often required in imperative languages.

#### Using State Snapshots

To implement the Memento Pattern, we can define a data type to represent the state of the Originator. We then create functions to save and restore this state, effectively implementing the memento functionality.

### Example: Implementing an Undo Feature in a Text Editor

Let's consider a simple text editor that allows users to type text and undo their actions. We'll use the Memento Pattern to implement the undo functionality.

#### Step 1: Define the State

First, we define the state of the text editor using a simple data type:

```haskell
-- Define the state of the text editor
data EditorState = EditorState {
    textContent :: String
} deriving (Show, Eq)
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Originator

The Originator is responsible for creating and restoring mementos. In our case, the text editor acts as the Originator.

```haskell
-- Define the Originator with functions to save and restore state
type Memento = EditorState

saveState :: EditorState -> Memento
saveState = id

restoreState :: Memento -> EditorState
restoreState = id
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Caretaker

The Caretaker manages the mementos. It stores the history of states and provides functionality to undo actions.

```haskell
-- Define the Caretaker to manage state history
data Caretaker = Caretaker {
    history :: [Memento]
} deriving (Show)

-- Initialize the Caretaker with an empty history
initCaretaker :: Caretaker
initCaretaker = Caretaker { history = [] }

-- Add a new state to the history
addMemento :: Memento -> Caretaker -> Caretaker
addMemento memento caretaker = caretaker { history = memento : history caretaker }

-- Undo the last action by restoring the previous state
undo :: Caretaker -> (Maybe EditorState, Caretaker)
undo caretaker = case history caretaker of
    [] -> (Nothing, caretaker)
    (memento:rest) -> (Just memento, caretaker { history = rest })
```

#### Step 4: Demonstrate the Text Editor

Let's put everything together and demonstrate the text editor with undo functionality.

```haskell
-- Main function to demonstrate the text editor
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let initialState = EditorState { textContent = "" }
    let caretaker = initCaretaker

    -- Simulate typing text
    let state1 = EditorState { textContent = "Hello" }
    let caretaker1 = addMemento (saveState initialState) caretaker

    let state2 = EditorState { textContent = "Hello, World" }
    let caretaker2 = addMemento (saveState state1) caretaker1

    -- Display current state
    putStrLn $ "Current State: " ++ show state2

    -- Undo last action
    let (maybeState, caretaker3) = undo caretaker2
    case maybeState of
        Nothing -> putStrLn "Nothing to undo."
        Just prevState -> putStrLn $ "After Undo: " ++ show prevState
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Memento Pattern in Haskell, consider the following:

- **Efficiency**: Immutable data structures can be more memory-efficient than mutable ones, as they allow sharing of unchanged data between states.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that the internal state of the Originator is not exposed through the Memento.
- **Complexity**: While Haskell's immutability simplifies state management, it may introduce complexity in managing large state histories.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's strong type system and immutability make it uniquely suited for implementing the Memento Pattern. The language's emphasis on pure functions and referential transparency ensures that state changes are predictable and easy to manage.

### Differences and Similarities

The Memento Pattern is often compared to the Command Pattern, as both involve capturing state. However, the Memento Pattern focuses on state snapshots, while the Command Pattern encapsulates actions. In Haskell, both patterns can be implemented using similar techniques, but the Memento Pattern leverages immutable data structures more directly.

### Visualizing the Memento Pattern

To better understand the Memento Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the Originator, Memento, and Caretaker.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Originator
    participant Memento
    participant Caretaker

    Originator ->> Memento: Create Memento
    Memento ->> Caretaker: Store Memento
    Caretaker ->> Originator: Restore Memento
```

This diagram illustrates how the Originator creates a Memento, which is then stored by the Caretaker. The Caretaker can later restore the Memento to revert the Originator's state.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the text editor example:

- Add functionality to redo actions.
- Implement a more complex state, such as a drawing application with multiple shapes.
- Experiment with different data structures to manage the state history.
