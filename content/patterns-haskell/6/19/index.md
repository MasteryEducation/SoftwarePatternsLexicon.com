## 6.19 Handling Side Effects with Effect Systems (e.g., Polysemy, Eff)

In the realm of functional programming, managing side effects is a crucial aspect of maintaining purity and composability. Haskell, being a purely functional language, provides various mechanisms to handle side effects, with effect systems like **Polysemy** and **Eff** standing out as powerful tools. These libraries allow developers to write effectful code that can be interpreted in multiple ways, enhancing flexibility and testability.

### Understanding Effect Systems

**Effect systems** are frameworks that enable the management of side effects in a structured and composable manner. They abstract the notion of side effects, allowing developers to define what effects their code can have and how these effects should be handled. This abstraction facilitates writing code that is both expressive and easy to reason about.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Effects**: Represent the operations that can cause side effects, such as logging, state manipulation, or IO operations.
2. **Interpreters**: Define how effects are executed. They can interpret effects in various ways, such as purely for testing or with real-world side effects in production.
3. **Effect Handlers**: Manage the execution of effects, providing a way to compose and sequence them.

### Libraries: Polysemy and Eff

#### Polysemy

[Polysemy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy) is a modern effect system library for Haskell that emphasizes simplicity and performance. It allows developers to define and interpret effects in a highly composable manner.

- **Advantages**:
  - **High Performance**: Polysemy is designed to be fast, leveraging advanced Haskell features.
  - **Simplicity**: The API is straightforward, making it easy to define and use effects.
  - **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of effects and interpretations.

#### Eff

[Eff](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extensible-effects) is another popular effect system library that focuses on extensibility and modularity. It allows developers to define extensible effects that can be composed and reused across different parts of an application.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Extensibility**: Easily extendable with new effects and handlers.
  - **Modularity**: Encourages modular design, making it easy to manage complex effectful code.
  - **Compatibility**: Works well with existing Haskell libraries and tools.

### Implementing Effect Systems

To effectively use effect systems like Polysemy and Eff, it's essential to understand how to define effect types and interpreters. Let's explore these concepts with examples.

#### Defining Effect Types

Effect types represent the operations that can cause side effects. In Polysemy, you define effects using data types and the `makeSem` function to generate effectful functions.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

import Polysemy

-- Define a simple logging effect
data Log m a where
  LogInfo :: String -> Log m ()

makeSem ''Log
```

In this example, we define a `Log` effect with a single operation `LogInfo` that logs a message. The `makeSem` function generates a function `logInfo` that can be used to perform the logging operation.

#### Writing Interpreters

Interpreters define how effects are executed. They can interpret effects in various ways, such as logging to the console or collecting logs in a list for testing.

```haskell
import Polysemy
import Polysemy.Output

-- Interpreter that logs to the console
runLogConsole :: Member (Embed IO) r => Sem (Log ': r) a -> Sem r a
runLogConsole = interpret $ \case
  LogInfo msg -> embed $ putStrLn msg
```

In this example, `runLogConsole` is an interpreter that logs messages to the console using `putStrLn`.

#### Composing Effects

Effect systems allow you to compose multiple effects, enabling complex interactions between different parts of your application.

```haskell
import Polysemy.State

-- Define a state effect
data Counter m a where
  Increment :: Counter m ()
  GetCount :: Counter m Int

makeSem ''Counter

-- Interpreter for the counter effect
runCounter :: Member (State Int) r => Sem (Counter ': r) a -> Sem r a
runCounter = interpret $ \case
  Increment -> modify (+1)
  GetCount -> get
```

Here, we define a `Counter` effect with operations to increment and get the count. The `runCounter` interpreter manages the state using the `State` effect.

### Example: Pure and Real-World Effects

Let's consider an example where we write code that can be run purely for testing and with real effects in production.

```haskell
import Polysemy
import Polysemy.State
import Polysemy.Output

-- Define a program that uses logging and state effects
program :: Members '[Log, Counter] r => Sem r ()
program = do
  logInfo "Starting program"
  increment
  count <- getCount
  logInfo $ "Current count: " ++ show count

-- Pure interpreter for testing
runPure :: Sem '[Log, Counter, State Int, Output String] a -> ([String], a)
runPure = run . runOutputMonoid pure . runState 0 . runCounter . runLogOutput

-- Real-world interpreter for production
runRealWorld :: Sem '[Log, Counter, Embed IO] a -> IO a
runRealWorld = runM . runCounter . runLogConsole
```

In this example, `program` is a simple program that logs messages and manipulates a counter. We define two interpreters: `runPure` for testing, which collects logs in a list, and `runRealWorld` for production, which logs to the console.

### Visualizing Effect Systems

To better understand how effect systems work, let's visualize the flow of effects and interpreters using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Program] --> B[Log Effect];
    A --> C[Counter Effect];
    B --> D[Log Interpreter];
    C --> E[Counter Interpreter];
    D --> F[Console Logging];
    E --> G[State Management];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the flow of effects in a program. The `Program` node represents the main program, which uses `Log Effect` and `Counter Effect`. These effects are interpreted by `Log Interpreter` and `Counter Interpreter`, which handle console logging and state management, respectively.
