## 6.10 Template Method Pattern with Higher-Order Functions

In the realm of software design patterns, the Template Method Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. In Haskell, we can leverage higher-order functions to achieve similar behavior, providing a flexible and powerful way to define algorithms with customizable steps.

### Understanding the Template Method Pattern

**Intent**: The Template Method Pattern aims to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without altering the algorithm's structure.

**Key Participants**:
- **Abstract Class**: Defines the template method and declares abstract methods for steps that subclasses should implement.
- **Concrete Class**: Implements the abstract methods to provide specific behavior for the algorithm's steps.

**Applicability**: Use the Template Method Pattern when:
- You have an algorithm with invariant steps and some customizable parts.
- You want to avoid code duplication by centralizing common behavior in a base class.
- You need to enforce a specific sequence of steps in an algorithm.

### Haskell Approach with Higher-Order Functions

In Haskell, we can use higher-order functions to achieve the same flexibility as the Template Method Pattern. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. This allows us to define a generic function that encapsulates the invariant parts of an algorithm, while accepting specific behaviors as parameters.

#### Example: Data Processing with Customizable Extraction

Let's consider a scenario where we need to process data. The parsing step is fixed, but the data extraction varies based on the type of data we are dealing with. We can define a higher-order function to encapsulate this behavior.

```haskell
-- Define a type alias for a data extraction function
type Extractor a = String -> a

-- Template method using a higher-order function
processData :: Extractor a -> String -> a
processData extractor rawData =
  let parsedData = parse rawData
  in extractor parsedData

-- Fixed parsing step
parse :: String -> String
parse = id  -- For simplicity, assume parsing is identity

-- Specific data extraction implementations
extractIntegers :: Extractor [Int]
extractIntegers = map read . words

extractWords :: Extractor [String]
extractWords = words

-- Usage examples
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let rawData = "1 2 3 4 5"
  print $ processData extractIntegers rawData  -- Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  print $ processData extractWords rawData     -- Output: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
```

In this example, `processData` is the template method that defines the algorithm's skeleton. It takes an `Extractor` function as a parameter, allowing us to customize the data extraction step. The `parse` function represents the fixed part of the algorithm, while `extractIntegers` and `extractWords` provide specific implementations for data extraction.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Template Method Pattern with higher-order functions, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Parse Data]
    B --> C{Choose Extractor}
    C -->|extractIntegers| D[Extract Integers]
    C -->|extractWords| E[Extract Words]
    D --> F[Return Result]
    E --> F[Return Result]
    F --> G[End]
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of the Template Method Pattern using higher-order functions. The data is first parsed, and then the appropriate extractor function is chosen to extract the desired information.

### Design Considerations

When using higher-order functions to implement the Template Method Pattern in Haskell, consider the following:

- **Function Composition**: Leverage Haskell's powerful function composition capabilities to build complex algorithms from simple functions.
- **Type Safety**: Use Haskell's strong type system to ensure that the functions passed as parameters are compatible with the expected types.
- **Reusability**: Design your higher-order functions to be reusable across different contexts by keeping them generic and parameterized.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's unique features, such as lazy evaluation and strong static typing, enhance the implementation of the Template Method Pattern:

- **Lazy Evaluation**: Allows you to define potentially infinite data structures and only evaluate what is necessary, optimizing performance.
- **Type Classes**: Use type classes to define a set of functions that can operate on different types, providing polymorphic behavior similar to subclassing in object-oriented languages.

### Differences and Similarities

The Template Method Pattern in Haskell using higher-order functions differs from its traditional object-oriented implementation in the following ways:

- **No Inheritance**: Haskell does not use inheritance. Instead, it relies on higher-order functions and type classes to achieve polymorphism.
- **Function Parameters**: Instead of overriding methods in subclasses, Haskell uses function parameters to customize behavior.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Template Method Pattern with higher-order functions, try modifying the code examples:

- Implement a new extractor function that extracts floating-point numbers from the data.
- Modify the `parse` function to perform more complex parsing, such as removing punctuation or converting text to lowercase.
