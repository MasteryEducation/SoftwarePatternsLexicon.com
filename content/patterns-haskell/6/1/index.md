## 6.1 Chain of Responsibility with Function Composition

In this section, we delve into the Chain of Responsibility pattern, a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it. In Haskell, we can implement this pattern using function composition, creating a pipeline of functions that process requests in sequence. This approach leverages Haskell's functional programming capabilities, such as higher-order functions and immutability, to build flexible and reusable systems.

### Understanding the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

**Intent**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receiver by allowing multiple objects to handle the request. The request is passed along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles it.

**Key Participants**:
- **Handler**: Defines an interface for handling requests.
- **ConcreteHandler**: Handles requests it is responsible for and forwards requests it does not handle to the next handler.
- **Client**: Initiates the request to a handler in the chain.

**Applicability**:
- Use this pattern when multiple objects can handle a request and the handler is not known a priori.
- When you want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
- When the set of handlers and their order can change dynamically.

### Implementing Chain of Responsibility in Haskell

In Haskell, we can implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern using function composition. This involves creating a series of functions that each take an input, perform some processing, and pass the result to the next function in the chain.

#### Function Composition in Haskell

Function composition in Haskell is achieved using the `(.)` operator, which allows us to combine two functions into a single function. For example, if we have two functions `f` and `g`, we can compose them as `f . g`, which is equivalent to `\x -> f (g x)`.

```haskell
-- Function composition example
f :: Int -> Int
f x = x + 1

g :: Int -> Int
g x = x * 2

-- Composed function
h :: Int -> Int
h = f . g

-- Usage
main :: IO ()
main = print (h 3) -- Output: 7
```

In this example, `h` is a composed function that first applies `g` to its input and then applies `f` to the result.

#### Building a Validation Chain

Let's consider a practical example where we build a validation chain for user input. Each function in the chain checks a condition and passes the result to the next function.

```haskell
-- Validation function type
type Validator a = a -> Either String a

-- Validator that checks if a number is positive
positiveValidator :: Validator Int
positiveValidator x
  | x > 0     = Right x
  | otherwise = Left "Number must be positive"

-- Validator that checks if a number is even
evenValidator :: Validator Int
evenValidator x
  | even x    = Right x
  | otherwise = Left "Number must be even"

-- Composing validators
validateNumber :: Validator Int
validateNumber = positiveValidator >=> evenValidator

-- Usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
  print $ validateNumber 4  -- Output: Right 4
  print $ validateNumber (-2) -- Output: Left "Number must be positive"
  print $ validateNumber 3  -- Output: Left "Number must be even"
```

In this example, we define two validators: `positiveValidator` and `evenValidator`. We then compose these validators using the `>=>` operator, which is the Kleisli composition operator for monads. This allows us to chain functions that return `Either` values, passing the result of one function as the input to the next.

### Visualizing the Chain of Responsibility

To better understand the flow of requests through the chain, let's visualize the process using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input] --> B{positiveValidator}
    B -- Right x --> C{evenValidator}
    B -- Left "Number must be positive" --> D[Error]
    C -- Right x --> E[Success]
    C -- Left "Number must be even" --> D[Error]
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram illustrates the flow of a number through the validation chain. The input is first processed by `positiveValidator`. If the number is positive, it proceeds to `evenValidator`. If any validator fails, an error is returned.

### Design Considerations

- **Flexibility**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to add, remove, or reorder handlers dynamically, making it highly flexible.
- **Decoupling**: By decoupling the sender and receiver, you can change the chain without affecting the client code.
- **Responsibility**: Ensure that each handler in the chain has a clear responsibility to avoid confusion and maintainability issues.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's strong type system and functional nature make it particularly well-suited for implementing the Chain of Responsibility pattern. The use of higher-order functions and monads allows for elegant composition and error handling.

### Differences and Similarities

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is similar to the Decorator pattern in that both involve a series of operations applied to an object. However, the Chain of Responsibility pattern focuses on passing a request along a chain, while the Decorator pattern focuses on adding behavior to an object.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the validation chain by adding new validators or modifying existing ones. For example, try adding a validator that checks if a number is less than 100.

```haskell
-- Validator that checks if a number is less than 100
lessThanHundredValidator :: Validator Int
lessThanHundredValidator x
  | x < 100   = Right x
  | otherwise = Left "Number must be less than 100"

-- Composing validators with the new validator
validateNumberWithLimit :: Validator Int
validateNumberWithLimit = positiveValidator >=> evenValidator >=> lessThanHundredValidator

-- Usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
  print $ validateNumberWithLimit 50  -- Output: Right 50
  print $ validateNumberWithLimit 150 -- Output: Left "Number must be less than 100"
```
