## 6.5 Mediator Pattern Using Event Systems

In the realm of software design patterns, the **Mediator Pattern** stands out as a powerful tool for managing complex interactions between objects. By encapsulating communication within a mediator, we can promote loose coupling and enhance the maintainability of our systems. In Haskell, this pattern can be effectively implemented using event-driven architectures and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) libraries. Let's delve into the intricacies of the Mediator Pattern and explore how it can be applied in Haskell.

### Mediator Concept

The Mediator Pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to communicate with each other, but direct communication would lead to tight coupling and increased complexity. By introducing a mediator, we can centralize communication logic, allowing objects to interact through the mediator rather than directly with each other.

#### Key Participants

1. **Mediator**: The central object that manages communication between other objects.
2. **Colleagues**: The objects that interact with each other through the mediator.

#### Intent

- **Promote Loose Coupling**: By decoupling objects from each other, we can reduce dependencies and improve the flexibility of our system.
- **Centralize Control Logic**: The mediator acts as a hub for communication, simplifying the management of interactions.

### Implementation in Haskell

In Haskell, the Mediator Pattern can be implemented using event-driven architectures and FRP libraries. These tools allow us to manage interactions in a declarative and functional manner, leveraging Haskell's strengths in handling side effects and concurrency.

#### Event-Driven Architectures

Event-driven architectures are a natural fit for the Mediator Pattern. By using events to signal changes and actions, we can decouple the components of our system and allow them to interact through a central mediator.

#### Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

FRP is a paradigm that allows us to work with time-varying values and events in a functional way. Libraries like `reactive-banana` provide abstractions for managing events and behaviors, making it easier to implement the Mediator Pattern in Haskell.

##### Example: Coordinating UI Components

Consider a GUI application where changes in one component need to affect others. By using the Mediator Pattern with an FRP library, we can coordinate these interactions efficiently.

```haskell
import Reactive.Banana
import Reactive.Banana.Frameworks

-- Define a type for UI events
data UIEvent = ButtonClick | TextInput String

-- Define a mediator function
mediator :: Event UIEvent -> MomentIO ()
mediator uiEvents = do
    -- Filter button click events
    let buttonClicks = filterE (== ButtonClick) uiEvents

    -- Filter text input events
    let textInputs = filterJust $ fmap (\case TextInput s -> Just s; _ -> Nothing) uiEvents

    -- Define reactions to events
    reactimate $ fmap (putStrLn . ("Button clicked: " ++)) buttonClicks
    reactimate $ fmap (putStrLn . ("Text input: " ++)) textInputs

-- Main function to set up the event network
main :: IO ()
main = do
    -- Create a new event network
    network <- compile $ do
        -- Create an event source for UI events
        (addUIEvent, uiEvents) <- newAddHandler
        mediator uiEvents

    -- Activate the network
    actuate network

    -- Simulate some UI events
    addUIEvent ButtonClick
    addUIEvent (TextInput "Hello, World!")
```

In this example, we define a simple mediator function that reacts to UI events. The `reactimate` function is used to specify actions in response to events, allowing us to centralize the interaction logic within the mediator.

### Visualizing the Mediator Pattern

To better understand the Mediator Pattern, let's visualize the flow of events and interactions in a typical application.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[UI Component 1] -->|Event| M[Mediator];
    B[UI Component 2] -->|Event| M;
    M -->|Action| A;
    M -->|Action| B;
```

In this diagram, UI components send events to the mediator, which then determines the appropriate actions to take. This centralized approach simplifies the management of interactions and reduces coupling between components.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Mediator Pattern in Haskell, consider the following:

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the mediator can handle a large number of events and interactions efficiently.
- **Concurrency**: Leverage Haskell's concurrency features to manage simultaneous events and actions.
- **Maintainability**: Keep the mediator logic simple and modular to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.

### Haskell Unique Features

Haskell's unique features, such as strong static typing and lazy evaluation, make it well-suited for implementing the Mediator Pattern. The type system can help ensure that interactions are correctly defined, while lazy evaluation allows for efficient handling of events and actions.

### Differences and Similarities

The Mediator Pattern is often compared to the Observer Pattern, as both involve managing interactions between objects. However, the Mediator Pattern centralizes communication within a single object, while the Observer Pattern involves direct communication between observers and subjects.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Mediator Pattern, try modifying the example code to add new types of events and reactions. Experiment with different FRP libraries and explore how they can be used to implement the pattern in various contexts.
