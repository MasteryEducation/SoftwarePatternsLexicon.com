## 24.11 Cheat Sheets for Common Libraries (e.g., Lens, Conduit)

In this section, we delve into some of the most powerful libraries in the Haskell ecosystem: **Lens**, **Conduit**, **Aeson**, and **Text**. These libraries are essential for expert Haskell developers, providing tools for data manipulation, streaming, JSON handling, and efficient text processing. This cheat sheet serves as a quick reference guide, complete with code snippets and explanations to help you master these libraries.

### Lens Library

The **Lens** library is a powerful tool for functional programming in Haskell, providing a way to manipulate data structures in a concise and expressive manner. It is particularly useful for accessing and updating deeply nested data.

#### Key Concepts

- **Lens**: A composable getter and setter.
- **Traversal**: A lens that can focus on multiple elements.
- **Prism**: A lens for working with sum types.
- **Iso**: A bidirectional transformation.

#### Common Functions

| Function       | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `view`         | Extracts the value from a lens.                  |
| `set`          | Sets the value at a lens.                        |
| `over`         | Applies a function to the value at a lens.       |
| `(^.)`         | Infix version of `view`.                         |
| `(.~)`         | Infix version of `set`.                          |
| `(%~)`         | Infix version of `over`.                         |

#### Sample Code Snippet

```haskell
import Control.Lens

data Person = Person { _name :: String, _age :: Int } deriving Show
makeLenses ''Person

-- Create a person
let john = Person "John Doe" 30

-- View the name
let name = john ^. name

-- Set the age
let olderJohn = john & age .~ 31

-- Increment the age
let evenOlderJohn = john & age %~ (+1)
```

#### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use Lens when you need to manipulate nested data structures without boilerplate code.
- **Pitfalls**: Overusing Lens can lead to code that is difficult to understand for those unfamiliar with the library.

#### Haskell Unique Features

- **Type Safety**: Lens leverages Haskell's type system to ensure safe data manipulation.
- **Composability**: Lenses can be composed to create complex data access patterns.

### Conduit Library

The **Conduit** library provides a framework for building efficient and composable streaming data pipelines. It is ideal for processing large datasets or handling I/O operations.

#### Key Concepts

- **Source**: A producer of data.
- **Sink**: A consumer of data.
- **Conduit**: A transformer that can both consume and produce data.

#### Common Functions

| Function       | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `yield`        | Produces a value in a source.                    |
| `await`        | Consumes a value in a sink.                      |
| `($$)`         | Connects a source to a sink.                     |
| `($=)`         | Connects a source to a conduit.                  |
| `($$+)`        | Connects a conduit to a sink.                    |

#### Sample Code Snippet

```haskell
import Conduit

main :: IO ()
main = runConduit $ yieldMany [1..10] .| mapC (*2) .| sinkList >>= print
```

#### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use Conduit for streaming data processing, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Pitfalls**: Ensure proper resource management to avoid leaks.

#### Haskell Unique Features

- **Resource Safety**: Conduit ensures resources are managed efficiently, even in the presence of exceptions.
- **Backpressure**: Conduit supports backpressure, allowing consumers to control the flow of data.

### Aeson Library

The **Aeson** library is the go-to choice for JSON parsing and encoding in Haskell. It provides a simple and efficient way to work with JSON data.

#### Key Concepts

- **ToJSON**: A typeclass for converting Haskell values to JSON.
- **FromJSON**: A typeclass for parsing JSON into Haskell values.
- **Value**: A generic JSON data type.

#### Common Functions

| Function       | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `encode`       | Converts a Haskell value to a JSON ByteString.   |
| `decode`       | Parses a JSON ByteString into a Haskell value.   |
| `eitherDecode` | Like `decode`, but returns an error message on failure. |

#### Sample Code Snippet

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import Data.Aeson
import GHC.Generics

data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int } deriving (Show, Generic)

instance ToJSON Person
instance FromJSON Person

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let person = Person "Alice" 25
    let json = encode person
    print json
    let decodedPerson = decode json :: Maybe Person
    print decodedPerson
```

#### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use Aeson for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **Pitfalls**: Be mindful of performance when dealing with large JSON data.

#### Haskell Unique Features

- **Generic Derivation**: Aeson can automatically derive JSON instances using GHC's Generic mechanism.
- **Type Safety**: Aeson provides type-safe JSON parsing, reducing runtime errors.

### Text Library

The **Text** library is designed for efficient manipulation of Unicode text. It is a replacement for the standard `String` type, offering better performance and memory usage.

#### Key Concepts

- **Text**: A type for Unicode text.
- **Builder**: A type for efficiently constructing `Text`.

#### Common Functions

| Function       | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `pack`         | Converts a `String` to `Text`.                   |
| `unpack`       | Converts `Text` to a `String`.                   |
| `append`       | Concatenates two `Text` values.                  |
| `length`       | Returns the number of characters in `Text`.      |
| `toUpper`      | Converts `Text` to uppercase.                    |

#### Sample Code Snippet

```haskell
import Data.Text
import qualified Data.Text.IO as T

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let text1 = pack "Hello"
    let text2 = pack "World"
    let combined = text1 `append` text2
    T.putStrLn combined
    print $ length combined
```

#### Design Considerations

- **When to Use**: Use Text for any non-trivial text processing tasks.
- **Pitfalls**: Be aware of encoding issues when interfacing with external systems.

#### Haskell Unique Features

- **Performance**: The Text library is optimized for performance, using packed UTF-16 arrays.
- **Immutability**: Text values are immutable, ensuring thread safety.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples provided. For instance, experiment with creating more complex lenses, or try building a conduit pipeline that processes a file. Consider how you might handle errors in JSON parsing with Aeson, or explore the performance differences between `String` and `Text`.

### Visualizing Lens Composition

To better understand how lenses compose, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Person] --> B[Name Lens];
    A --> C[Age Lens];
    B --> D[View/Set Name];
    C --> E[View/Set Age];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates how a `Person` data structure can be accessed and modified using `Name` and `Age` lenses. Each lens provides a path to view or set the respective field.
