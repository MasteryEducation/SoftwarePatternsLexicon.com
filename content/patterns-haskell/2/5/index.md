## 2.5 Pattern Matching and Algebraic Data Types

In the realm of functional programming, Haskell stands out for its expressive power and elegance, largely due to its robust support for pattern matching and algebraic data types (ADTs). These features allow developers to write concise, readable, and maintainable code by modeling complex data structures naturally. In this section, we will delve deep into these concepts, exploring their syntax, usage, and best practices in Haskell.

### Understanding Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Haskell that allows you to deconstruct data structures directly within function definitions. It provides a way to check a value against a pattern and, if it matches, to extract values from it. This feature is not only syntactically elegant but also enhances code readability and maintainability.

#### Basic Pattern Matching

Let's start with a simple example of pattern matching using a tuple:

```haskell
-- A function to add two pairs of integers
addPairs :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int)
addPairs (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
```

In this example, the function `addPairs` takes two tuples as arguments and uses pattern matching to extract their components. The pattern `(x1, y1)` matches the first tuple, and `(x2, y2)` matches the second. This allows us to directly use `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` in the function body.

#### Pattern Matching with Lists

Pattern matching is particularly useful with lists, which are a fundamental data structure in Haskell. Consider the following example:

```haskell
-- A function to compute the length of a list
listLength :: [a] -> Int
listLength [] = 0
listLength (_:xs) = 1 + listLength xs
```

Here, the function `listLength` uses pattern matching to handle two cases: an empty list `[]` and a non-empty list `(_:xs)`. The underscore `_` is a wildcard that matches any element, and `xs` represents the rest of the list.

### Advanced Pattern Matching Techniques

Haskell's pattern matching capabilities extend beyond simple deconstruction. Let's explore some advanced techniques.

#### As-Patterns

As-patterns allow you to match a pattern while keeping a reference to the entire value. They are denoted using the `@` symbol. Here's an example:

```haskell
-- A function to duplicate the first element of a list
duplicateFirst :: [a] -> [a]
duplicateFirst xs@(x:_) = x : xs
duplicateFirst [] = []
```

In this function, `xs@(x:_)` matches a non-empty list, binding `xs` to the entire list and `x` to its first element. This allows us to prepend `x` to `xs`, effectively duplicating the first element.

#### Guards and Pattern Matching

Guards can be combined with pattern matching to add conditional logic to function definitions. Here's an example:

```haskell
-- A function to classify numbers
classifyNumber :: Int -> String
classifyNumber n
  | n < 0     = "Negative"
  | n == 0    = "Zero"
  | otherwise = "Positive"
```

In this function, `classifyNumber` uses guards to classify an integer as "Negative", "Zero", or "Positive". Guards are evaluated in order, and the first true guard determines the result.

### Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

Algebraic data types are a cornerstone of Haskell's type system, allowing you to define complex data structures using a combination of sum and product types. They enable you to model real-world data more naturally and expressively.

#### Sum Types

Sum types, also known as tagged unions or variant types, allow a value to be one of several different types. They are defined using the `data` keyword. Here's an example:

```haskell
-- A data type representing a shape
data Shape = Circle Float | Rectangle Float Float
```

In this example, `Shape` is a sum type that can be either a `Circle` with a radius or a `Rectangle` with width and height. Each variant is called a constructor.

#### Product Types

Product types, on the other hand, combine multiple values into a single type. They are akin to tuples but with named fields. Here's an example:

```haskell
-- A data type representing a point in 2D space
data Point = Point { x :: Float, y :: Float }
```

In this example, `Point` is a product type with two fields, `x` and `y`, both of type `Float`. This allows you to create more descriptive and self-documenting data structures.

### Combining Pattern Matching and ADTs

Pattern matching and algebraic data types complement each other perfectly. You can use pattern matching to deconstruct ADTs and access their components. Here's an example:

```haskell
-- A function to compute the area of a shape
area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = pi * r * r
area (Rectangle w h) = w * h
```

In this function, `area` uses pattern matching to handle different variants of the `Shape` type. It computes the area of a `Circle` using its radius `r` and the area of a `Rectangle` using its width `w` and height `h`.

### Recursive Data Types

Haskell's ADTs can also be recursive, allowing you to define complex data structures like trees and linked lists. Here's an example of a binary tree:

```haskell
-- A data type representing a binary tree
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

-- A function to compute the size of a tree
treeSize :: Tree a -> Int
treeSize Empty = 0
treeSize (Node _ left right) = 1 + treeSize left + treeSize right
```

In this example, `Tree` is a recursive data type with two constructors: `Empty` for an empty tree and `Node` for a tree node with a value and two subtrees. The function `treeSize` uses pattern matching to compute the size of the tree.

### Visualizing Algebraic Data Types

To better understand the structure of algebraic data types, let's visualize them using Mermaid.js diagrams.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        +Circle(Float)
        +Rectangle(Float, Float)
    }

    class Point {
        +Float x
        +Float y
    }

    class Tree {
        +Empty
        +Node(a, Tree, Tree)
    }
```

In this diagram, we see the `Shape`, `Point`, and `Tree` data types represented as classes with their respective constructors and fields.

### Best Practices for Pattern Matching and ADTs

When using pattern matching and ADTs in Haskell, consider the following best practices:

- **Use Pattern Matching for Clarity**: Pattern matching can make your code more readable and concise. Use it to deconstruct data structures and handle different cases explicitly.
- **Leverage ADTs for Expressiveness**: Algebraic data types allow you to model complex data structures naturally. Use them to create self-documenting code that reflects the problem domain.
- **Avoid Overlapping Patterns**: Ensure that your patterns are non-overlapping and exhaustive. This prevents runtime errors and makes your code more robust.
- **Use Guards for Conditional Logic**: Combine pattern matching with guards to add conditional logic to your functions. This can make your code more expressive and easier to understand.
- **Document Your Data Types**: Provide clear documentation for your ADTs and their constructors. This helps other developers understand the purpose and usage of your data structures.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of pattern matching and ADTs, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- Add a new constructor to the `Shape` data type, such as `Triangle`, and update the `area` function to handle it.
- Implement a function to compute the depth of a binary tree using the `Tree` data type.
- Create a new ADT to represent a simple arithmetic expression and write a function to evaluate it.
