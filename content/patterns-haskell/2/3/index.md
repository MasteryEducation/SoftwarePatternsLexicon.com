## 2.3 Higher-Order Functions and Function Composition

In the realm of functional programming, **higher-order functions** and **function composition** are foundational concepts that empower developers to write elegant, modular, and reusable code. In this section, we will delve into these concepts, explore their applications, and provide practical examples to solidify your understanding.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This capability allows for a high degree of abstraction and flexibility in programming.

#### Key Characteristics of Higher-Order Functions

- **Abstraction**: They enable you to abstract common patterns of computation.
- **Modularity**: By encapsulating behavior, they promote modular code.
- **Reusability**: Functions can be reused across different contexts by passing different functions as arguments.

#### Examples of Higher-Order Functions

Let's start with a simple example to illustrate the concept of higher-order functions in Haskell.

```haskell
-- A higher-order function that takes a function and a list, and applies the function to each element
applyToEach :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
applyToEach f xs = map f xs

-- Example usage
increment :: Int -> Int
increment x = x + 1

main :: IO ()
main = print (applyToEach increment [1, 2, 3, 4])  -- Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, `applyToEach` is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and a list `xs`, applying `f` to each element of `xs`.

#### Common Higher-Order Functions in Haskell

Haskell provides several built-in higher-order functions that are widely used:

- **map**: Applies a function to each element of a list.
- **filter**: Selects elements of a list that satisfy a predicate.
- **foldr/foldl**: Reduces a list to a single value using a binary function.

### Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. In Haskell, function composition is denoted by the `.` operator.

#### Benefits of Function Composition

- **Simplification**: Breaks down complex operations into simpler, reusable components.
- **Readability**: Enhances code readability by expressing operations in a declarative manner.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitates easier maintenance by isolating changes to individual functions.

#### Function Composition in Action

Consider the following example, which demonstrates function composition in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Define two simple functions
double :: Int -> Int
double x = x * 2

square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

-- Compose the functions
doubleThenSquare :: Int -> Int
doubleThenSquare = square . double

main :: IO ()
main = print (doubleThenSquare 3)  -- Output: 36
```

In this example, `doubleThenSquare` is a new function created by composing `square` and `double`. The composition `square . double` means "apply `double` first, then `square`."

#### Visualizing Function Composition

To better understand function composition, let's visualize the flow of data through composed functions using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input: 3] --> B[Double: x * 2]
    B --> C[Output of Double: 6]
    C --> D[Square: x * x]
    D --> E[Output: 36]
```

This diagram illustrates how the input flows through the `double` function, producing an intermediate result, which is then passed to the `square` function to produce the final output.

### Applications of Higher-Order Functions and Function Composition

Higher-order functions and function composition are powerful tools for enhancing code modularity and reusability. Let's explore some practical applications:

#### Data Transformation

Higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `foldr` are commonly used for data transformation tasks. By composing these functions, you can build complex data processing pipelines.

```haskell
-- Example: Transform a list of numbers by doubling and then filtering even numbers
processNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]
processNumbers = filter even . map double

main :: IO ()
main = print (processNumbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  -- Output: [4, 8]
```

In this example, `processNumbers` is a composed function that first doubles each number and then filters out the odd numbers.

#### Event Handling

In event-driven programming, higher-order functions can be used to define event handlers that are composed of multiple smaller functions.

```haskell
-- Define an event handler that logs and processes an event
handleEvent :: (String -> IO ()) -> (String -> IO ()) -> String -> IO ()
handleEvent log process event = do
    log event
    process event

-- Example usage
logEvent :: String -> IO ()
logEvent event = putStrLn ("Logging event: " ++ event)

processEvent :: String -> IO ()
processEvent event = putStrLn ("Processing event: " ++ event)

main :: IO ()
main = handleEvent logEvent processEvent "UserLoggedIn"
```

Here, `handleEvent` is a higher-order function that takes two functions, `log` and `process`, and an event string. It logs and processes the event using the provided functions.

#### Building DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)

Higher-order functions and function composition are instrumental in building DSLs, allowing you to define concise and expressive syntax for specific domains.

```haskell
-- Define a simple DSL for arithmetic expressions
data Expr = Val Int | Add Expr Expr | Mul Expr Expr

-- Evaluate an expression
eval :: Expr -> Int
eval (Val n) = n
eval (Add x y) = eval x + eval y
eval (Mul x y) = eval x * eval y

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = print (eval (Add (Val 1) (Mul (Val 2) (Val 3))))  -- Output: 7
```

In this example, we define a DSL for arithmetic expressions using algebraic data types. The `eval` function evaluates expressions by recursively applying operations.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Experiment with different functions**: Replace `increment` with a different function in the `applyToEach` example.
- **Compose more functions**: Add more functions to the `doubleThenSquare` composition.
- **Create a new DSL**: Extend the arithmetic DSL with additional operations like subtraction or division.

### Knowledge Check

- **What is function composition?** The process of combining functions to create new functionality.
