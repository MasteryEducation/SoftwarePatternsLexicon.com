## 3.14 Actors and the Akka Framework

Concurrency and parallelism are crucial aspects of modern software systems, especially when dealing with distributed architectures and high-performance applications. The Akka Framework, built on the Actor Model, provides a powerful toolkit for building concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems in Scala. In this section, we'll delve into the core concepts of the Actor Model, explore the Akka Framework, and provide guidance on designing safe and scalable concurrent systems.

### Understanding the Actor Model

The Actor Model is a conceptual model for handling concurrent computation. It abstracts away the complexities of thread management and synchronization by encapsulating state and behavior within actors. Each actor is an independent unit that communicates with other actors through message passing, making it inherently concurrent and distributed.

#### Key Concepts of the Actor Model

1. **Actors**: The fundamental unit of computation in the Actor Model. An actor encapsulates state and behavior and communicates with other actors through asynchronous message passing.

2. **Messages**: Immutable objects that actors use to communicate. Messages are sent asynchronously, allowing actors to process them at their own pace.

3. **Mailboxes**: Queues where incoming messages are stored until the actor is ready to process them.

4. **Supervision**: A mechanism for managing actor failures. Supervisors monitor their child actors and apply predefined strategies to handle failures.

5. **Location Transparency**: Actors can communicate without knowing each other's physical location, enabling seamless distribution across nodes.

### Introducing the Akka Framework

Akka is a powerful toolkit and runtime for building concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications on the JVM. It implements the Actor Model and provides a rich set of features for managing concurrency, distribution, and resilience.

#### Core Components of Akka

1. **ActorSystem**: The entry point for creating and managing actors. It provides the infrastructure for actor creation, supervision, and message dispatching.

2. **Actors**: Defined by extending the `Actor` trait and implementing the `receive` method to handle incoming messages.

3. **Props**: A configuration object used to create actors. It defines the actor's behavior and initial state.

4. **Routers**: Components that manage a group of actors and distribute messages among them, enabling load balancing and parallel processing.

5. **Dispatchers**: Responsible for managing the execution of actors. They determine how actors are scheduled and executed.

6. **Supervision Strategies**: Define how parent actors handle failures in their child actors, ensuring system resilience.

### Designing Actors in Akka

To design effective actors in Akka, it's essential to understand the principles of actor behavior, message handling, and state management.

#### Defining Actor Behavior

Actors in Akka are defined by extending the `Actor` trait and implementing the `receive` method, which defines how the actor responds to incoming messages.

```scala
import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorSystem, Props}

// Define an actor by extending the Actor trait
class GreetingActor extends Actor {
  def receive: Receive = {
    case "hello" => println("Hello, world!")
    case _       => println("Unknown message")
  }
}

// Create an ActorSystem
val system = ActorSystem("GreetingSystem")

// Create an instance of the GreetingActor
val greetingActor = system.actorOf(Props[GreetingActor], "greetingActor")

// Send messages to the actor
greetingActor ! "hello"
greetingActor ! "goodbye"
```

#### Managing Actor State

Actors can maintain internal state, which is encapsulated and not shared with other actors. This state can be updated based on the messages received.

```scala
import akka.actor.Actor

class CounterActor extends Actor {
  private var count = 0

  def receive: Receive = {
    case "increment" =>
      count += 1
      println(s"Count: $count")
    case "get" =>
      sender() ! count
  }
}
```

#### Handling Actor Lifecycle

Actors have a lifecycle, including creation, message processing, and termination. Akka provides hooks for managing these lifecycle events.

```scala
import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorSystem, Props}

class LifecycleActor extends Actor {
  override def preStart(): Unit = println("Actor is starting")
  override def postStop(): Unit = println("Actor has stopped")

  def receive: Receive = {
    case msg => println(s"Received: $msg")
  }
}

val system = ActorSystem("LifecycleSystem")
val lifecycleActor = system.actorOf(Props[LifecycleActor], "lifecycleActor")

lifecycleActor ! "Test message"
system.terminate()
```

### Designing Safe and Scalable Concurrent Systems

Akka provides several features to ensure the safety and scalability of concurrent systems, including supervision strategies, routers, and dispatchers.

#### Supervision and Fault Tolerance

Supervision is a key concept in Akka, allowing actors to monitor and manage the failures of their child actors. Supervisors can apply different strategies, such as restarting or stopping the child actor, to handle failures gracefully.

```scala
import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorSystem, Props, OneForOneStrategy, SupervisorStrategy}
import akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy._

class WorkerActor extends Actor {
  def receive: Receive = {
    case "fail" => throw new RuntimeException("Failure")
    case msg    => println(s"Received: $msg")
  }
}

class SupervisorActor extends Actor {
  override val supervisorStrategy: SupervisorStrategy = OneForOneStrategy() {
    case _: RuntimeException => Restart
  }

  def receive: Receive = {
    case props: Props => sender() ! context.actorOf(props)
  }
}

val system = ActorSystem("SupervisionSystem")
val supervisor = system.actorOf(Props[SupervisorActor], "supervisor")

val worker = system.actorOf(Props[WorkerActor], "worker")
worker ! "fail"
```

#### Routers for Load Balancing

Routers manage a group of actors and distribute messages among them, enabling load balancing and parallel processing. Akka provides several built-in routers, such as `RoundRobinPool` and `BroadcastPool`.

```scala
import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorSystem, Props}
import akka.routing.RoundRobinPool

class Worker extends Actor {
  def receive: Receive = {
    case msg => println(s"Worker ${self.path.name} received: $msg")
  }
}

val system = ActorSystem("RoutingSystem")
val router = system.actorOf(RoundRobinPool(5).props(Props[Worker]), "router")

for (i <- 1 to 10) {
  router ! s"Message $i"
}
```

#### Dispatchers for Execution Management

Dispatchers control how actors are scheduled and executed. They can be configured to optimize performance based on the application's needs.

```hocon
akka {
  actor {
    default-dispatcher {
      type = "Dispatcher"
      executor = "fork-join-executor"
      fork-join-executor {
        parallelism-min = 2
        parallelism-factor = 2.0
        parallelism-max = 10
      }
      throughput = 100
    }
  }
}
```

### Visualizing Actor Systems

To better understand the flow of messages and interactions within an actor system, we can use diagrams to visualize the architecture and relationships between actors.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[ActorSystem] --> B[SupervisorActor];
    B --> C[WorkerActor1];
    B --> D[WorkerActor2];
    B --> E[WorkerActor3];
    C -->|Message| F[Mailbox];
    D -->|Message| F;
    E -->|Message| F;
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates an actor system with a `SupervisorActor` managing three `WorkerActors`. Messages are sent to the worker actors through a shared mailbox.
