## 3.20 Scala 3 Enhancements and Their Impact on Design Patterns

Scala 3, also known as Dotty, introduces a suite of new features and enhancements that significantly influence the way design patterns are implemented in Scala. These enhancements not only improve code clarity and maintainability but also provide more powerful tools for type safety and metaprogramming. In this section, we will delve into these new features, explore their impact on design patterns, and provide guidance for expert developers looking to leverage Scala 3 in their projects.

### Overview of Scala 3 New Features

#### Introduction to Scala 3 (Dotty)

Scala 3, often referred to as Dotty during its development phase, represents a major evolution of the Scala language. It brings a host of new features aimed at simplifying the language, improving type safety, and enhancing developer productivity. The transition from Scala 2 to Scala 3 is designed to be as smooth as possible, with a focus on backward compatibility and gradual migration paths.

#### Compatibility with Scala 2.x

Scala 3 maintains a high degree of compatibility with Scala 2.x, allowing developers to migrate their codebases incrementally. The Scala 3 compiler can compile Scala 2 code, and tools like `scala-3-migrate` assist in the migration process by automatically updating code to use Scala 3 syntax and features where applicable.

### New Syntax Enhancements

#### Optional Braces and Indentation-Based Syntax

Scala 3 introduces a more concise syntax by allowing optional braces and supporting indentation-based syntax, similar to Python. This change simplifies the code structure and makes it more readable, especially in large codebases.

```scala
// Scala 2 style with braces
def greet(name: String): Unit = {
  println(s"Hello, $name!")
}

// Scala 3 style with indentation
def greet(name: String): Unit =
  println(s"Hello, $name!")
```

This syntax enhancement encourages cleaner code and reduces visual clutter, making it easier to follow the logic of complex design patterns.

### Contextual Abstractions

#### Replacing Implicits with `given`/`using` Clauses

One of the most significant changes in Scala 3 is the replacement of implicits with `given`/`using` clauses. This change addresses the complexity and opacity often associated with implicits in Scala 2, providing a more explicit and understandable mechanism for dependency injection and type class instances.

```scala
trait Show[T]:
  def show(value: T): String

given Show[Int] with
  def show(value: Int): String = value.toString

def printValue[T](value: T)(using showInstance: Show[T]): Unit =
  println(showInstance.show(value))

printValue(42) // Output: 42
```

#### Implementing Type Classes with Given Instances

The `given`/`using` syntax simplifies the implementation of type classes, making it easier to define and use them in a clear and concise manner. This improvement enhances the expressiveness of design patterns that rely on type classes, such as the Strategy pattern.

#### Improving Code Clarity with Contextual Functions

Contextual functions in Scala 3 allow for cleaner and more readable code by explicitly specifying the context in which a function operates. This feature is particularly useful in functional design patterns, where context management is crucial.

### Extension Methods

#### Adding Methods to Existing Types Without Implicits

Scala 3 introduces extension methods, which allow developers to add new methods to existing types without using implicits. This feature simplifies the implementation of the Decorator pattern by enabling the addition of functionality to objects in a straightforward manner.

```scala
extension (s: String)
  def greet: String = s"Hello, $s!"

val name = "World"
println(name.greet) // Output: Hello, World!
```

### Union and Intersection Types

#### Enhancing Type Safety and Expressiveness

Union and intersection types in Scala 3 provide a powerful way to express complex type relationships. Union types allow a value to be one of several types, while intersection types require a value to satisfy multiple type constraints.

```scala
def process(input: Int | String): String = input match
  case i: Int    => s"Number: $i"
  case s: String => s"Text: $s"

println(process(42))        // Output: Number: 42
println(process("Scala"))   // Output: Text: Scala
```

#### Applications in Algebraic Data Types and Pattern Matching

These types enhance the expressiveness of algebraic data types and pattern matching, making it easier to implement patterns like the Visitor pattern, where different types of elements need to be processed uniformly.

### Opaque Types

#### Hiding Implementation Details While Exposing Type Interfaces

Opaque types in Scala 3 allow developers to define types that hide their implementation details while exposing a specific interface. This feature is useful for enforcing invariants and encapsulation, which are key principles in many design patterns.

```scala
opaque type UserId = Int

object UserId:
  def apply(id: Int): UserId = id

def showUserId(id: UserId): String = s"User ID: $id"

val id: UserId = UserId(123)
println(showUserId(id)) // Output: User ID: 123
```

### Metaprogramming in Scala 3

#### Inline Methods for Compile-Time Computations

Scala 3 introduces inline methods, which allow computations to be performed at compile time. This feature can optimize performance by eliminating runtime overhead for certain operations.

```scala
inline def power(x: Double, n: Int): Double =
  if n == 0 then 1.0
  else x * power(x, n - 1)

val result = power(2.0, 3) // Computed at compile time
```

#### Macros and Compile-Time Reflection

Scala 3 provides a safer and more powerful metaprogramming capability with its new macro system and compile-time reflection. These features enable developers to generate code at compile time, ensuring type safety and reducing runtime errors.

#### Safer and More Powerful Metaprogramming Capabilities

The new metaprogramming features in Scala 3 allow for more robust and maintainable code generation, which can be leveraged in design patterns that require dynamic behavior or code transformation.

### Multiversal Equality

#### Controlling Equality Comparisons Between Types

Scala 3 introduces multiversal equality, which allows developers to control equality comparisons between types. This feature prevents unintended equality checks and enhances type safety.

```scala
import scala.language.strictEquality

given CanEqual[Int, String] = CanEqual.derived

val isEqual = (42 == "42") // Compilation error without given instance
```

### Impact on Existing Design Patterns

#### Refactoring Patterns Using New Features

The enhancements in Scala 3 provide opportunities to refactor existing design patterns, making them more concise, expressive, and type-safe. For example, the Strategy pattern can be implemented using contextual abstractions, while the Decorator pattern benefits from extension methods.

### Best Practices for Migrating to Scala 3

#### Strategies and Tools for Migration

Migrating to Scala 3 requires careful planning and execution. Developers should leverage tools like `scala-3-migrate` to automate parts of the migration process and ensure compatibility with existing Scala 2 code. It's important to test thoroughly and refactor code incrementally to take full advantage of Scala 3's new features.

### Case Studies and Examples

#### Real-World Applications of Scala 3 Enhancements

To illustrate the impact of Scala 3 on design patterns, let's explore a few case studies that demonstrate the practical application of these enhancements in real-world scenarios.

**Case Study 1: Implementing a Plugin System with Extension Methods**

In this case study, we will implement a plugin system using Scala 3's extension methods. The goal is to allow developers to add new functionality to an existing application without modifying its core codebase.

```scala
trait Plugin:
  def execute(): Unit

extension (plugin: Plugin)
  def logExecution(): Unit =
    println(s"Executing plugin: ${plugin.getClass.getSimpleName}")
    plugin.execute()

class SamplePlugin extends Plugin:
  def execute(): Unit = println("Sample plugin executed")

val plugin = new SamplePlugin()
plugin.logExecution() // Output: Executing plugin: SamplePlugin
                      //         Sample plugin executed
```

**Case Study 2: Enhancing a DSL with Union Types**

In this case study, we will enhance a domain-specific language (DSL) using Scala 3's union types. The DSL will allow users to define and execute mathematical operations with different types of inputs.

```scala
sealed trait Expr
case class Number(value: Int) extends Expr
case class Add(left: Expr, right: Expr) extends Expr
case class Subtract(left: Expr, right: Expr) extends Expr

def evaluate(expr: Expr): Int = expr match
  case Number(value) => value
  case Add(left, right) => evaluate(left) + evaluate(right)
  case Subtract(left, right) => evaluate(left) - evaluate(right)

val expr = Add(Number(5), Subtract(Number(10), Number(3)))
println(evaluate(expr)) // Output: 12
```
