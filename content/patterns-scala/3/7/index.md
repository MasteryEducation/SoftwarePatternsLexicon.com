## 3.7 Functional Domain Modeling

Functional Domain Modeling (FDM) is a powerful approach to designing software systems that leverages the strengths of functional programming and type systems. In Scala, FDM allows developers to create robust, maintainable, and expressive domain models by utilizing features such as case classes, sealed traits, and the type system. This section will guide you through the concepts, techniques, and best practices for functional domain modeling in Scala.

### Introduction to Functional Domain Modeling

Functional Domain Modeling is the practice of representing the problem domain of a software application using functional programming principles. It emphasizes immutability, composability, and the use of types to enforce constraints and express domain logic. By capturing the essence of the domain in the type system, developers can create models that are not only more expressive but also safer and easier to reason about.

#### Key Concepts

- **Immutability**: Ensures that once data is created, it cannot be changed. This leads to more predictable and reliable code.
- **Composability**: Allows small, simple functions to be combined to build more complex functionality.
- **Type Safety**: Uses the type system to enforce constraints and invariants, reducing runtime errors.

### Capturing Domain Models with Case Classes

Case classes in Scala are a fundamental building block for functional domain modeling. They provide a concise and expressive way to define immutable data structures that represent entities in your domain.

#### Defining Case Classes

A case class is a special type of class in Scala that is optimized for pattern matching and immutability. Here's a simple example:

```scala
case class User(id: Int, name: String, email: String)
```

In this example, `User` is a case class with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `email`. Case classes automatically provide several useful features:

- **Immutability**: All fields are immutable by default.
- **Pattern Matching**: Case classes can be used in pattern matching expressions.
- **Equality**: Case classes automatically implement `equals` and `hashCode` based on their fields.
- **Copy Method**: Allows creating a copy of an object with some fields modified.

#### Using Case Classes in Domain Models

Case classes are ideal for representing entities and value objects in your domain. They allow you to define the structure and constraints of your data in a clear and concise manner.

```scala
case class Address(street: String, city: String, postalCode: String)

case class Order(id: Int, user: User, items: List[String], shippingAddress: Address)
```

In this example, `Address` and `Order` are case classes that represent different aspects of the domain. By using case classes, you can ensure that your domain model is both expressive and type-safe.

### Sealed Traits for Algebraic Data Types

Sealed traits are another powerful feature of Scala that can be used to define algebraic data types (ADTs). ADTs are a way of modeling data that can take on one of several different forms, each with its own associated data.

#### Defining Sealed Traits

A sealed trait is a trait that can only be extended by classes and objects defined in the same file. This restriction allows the compiler to know all possible subtypes of the trait, enabling exhaustive pattern matching.

```scala
sealed trait PaymentMethod

case class CreditCard(number: String, expirationDate: String) extends PaymentMethod
case class PayPal(email: String) extends PaymentMethod
case object Cash extends PaymentMethod
```

In this example, `PaymentMethod` is a sealed trait with three possible subtypes: `CreditCard`, `PayPal`, and `Cash`. This allows you to represent different payment methods in a type-safe way.

#### Pattern Matching with Sealed Traits

Sealed traits work seamlessly with pattern matching, allowing you to handle different cases in a concise and expressive manner.

```scala
def processPayment(payment: PaymentMethod): String = payment match {
  case CreditCard(number, _) => s"Processing credit card payment for card number $number"
  case PayPal(email) => s"Processing PayPal payment for account $email"
  case Cash => "Processing cash payment"
}
```

This function processes a `PaymentMethod` by pattern matching on its type and handling each case accordingly.

### Designing Domain Models with Types

The type system in Scala is a powerful tool for designing domain models. By using types to represent domain concepts and constraints, you can create models that are both expressive and safe.

#### Encoding Domain Logic with Types

Types can be used to encode domain logic and enforce constraints at compile time. This reduces the likelihood of runtime errors and makes your code more robust.

```scala
case class Email(value: String) {
  require(value.contains("@"), "Invalid email address")
}

case class Age(value: Int) {
  require(value >= 0, "Age cannot be negative")
}
```

In this example, `Email` and `Age` are value classes that enforce constraints on their values. By using types to represent these concepts, you can ensure that invalid data is caught at compile time.

#### Leveraging Type Aliases

Type aliases can be used to give meaningful names to existing types, making your code more readable and expressive.

```scala
type UserId = Int
type ProductId = Int

case class Product(id: ProductId, name: String, price: Double)
```

In this example, `UserId` and `ProductId` are type aliases for `Int`, providing more context and meaning to the code.

### Integrating Functional and Object-Oriented Concepts

Scala is a hybrid language that combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. This allows you to leverage the best of both worlds when designing your domain models.

#### Using Traits for Behavior

Traits in Scala can be used to define reusable behavior that can be mixed into different classes. This allows you to separate concerns and promote code reuse.

```scala
trait Discount {
  def applyDiscount(amount: Double): Double
}

case class PercentageDiscount(percentage: Double) extends Discount {
  def applyDiscount(amount: Double): Double = amount - (amount * percentage / 100)
}

case class FixedAmountDiscount(amount: Double) extends Discount {
  def applyDiscount(amount: Double): Double = amount - amount
}
```

In this example, `Discount` is a trait that defines a common interface for different types of discounts. `PercentageDiscount` and `FixedAmountDiscount` are concrete implementations that provide specific behavior.

#### Composing Domain Models

By combining case classes, sealed traits, and traits, you can create rich and expressive domain models that capture the essence of your problem domain.

```scala
sealed trait OrderStatus
case object Pending extends OrderStatus
case object Shipped extends OrderStatus
case object Delivered extends OrderStatus

case class Order(id: Int, user: User, items: List[String], status: OrderStatus, discount: Option[Discount])
```

In this example, `Order` is a case class that represents an order in the system. It uses a sealed trait `OrderStatus` to represent the different states an order can be in, and an optional `Discount` trait to apply discounts.

### Visualizing Functional Domain Models

To better understand the structure and relationships within a functional domain model, it's helpful to visualize them using diagrams. Below is a class diagram representing the domain model for an e-commerce system.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        Int id
        String name
        String email
    }
    class Address {
        String street
        String city
        String postalCode
    }
    class Order {
        Int id
        User user
        List~String~ items
        OrderStatus status
        Discount discount
    }
    class PaymentMethod
    class CreditCard {
        String number
        String expirationDate
    }
    class PayPal {
        String email
    }
    class Cash
    class OrderStatus
    class Pending
    class Shipped
    class Delivered
    class Discount
    class PercentageDiscount {
        Double percentage
    }
    class FixedAmountDiscount {
        Double amount
    }

    User --> Order
    Address --> Order
    Order --> OrderStatus
    Order --> Discount
    Order --> PaymentMethod
    PaymentMethod <|-- CreditCard
    PaymentMethod <|-- PayPal
    PaymentMethod <|-- Cash
    OrderStatus <|-- Pending
    OrderStatus <|-- Shipped
    OrderStatus <|-- Delivered
    Discount <|-- PercentageDiscount
    Discount <|-- FixedAmountDiscount
```

### Best Practices for Functional Domain Modeling
