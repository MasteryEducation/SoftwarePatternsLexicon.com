## 3.6 Scala's Object-Oriented Features

Scala is a unique language that seamlessly integrates object-oriented programming (OOP) with functional programming. This section delves into Scala's object-oriented features, which are crucial for expert software engineers and architects aiming to design robust and scalable systems. We'll explore classes, objects, inheritance, and abstract classes, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these features can be leveraged in Scala.

### Classes, Objects, and Companions

#### Classes in Scala

In Scala, classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for the creation of complex data structures and functionalities. Let's explore the syntax and usage of classes in Scala.

```scala
// Define a simple class in Scala
class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
  // Method within the class
  def greet(): String = s"Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old."
}

// Instantiate an object of the class
val person = new Person("Alice", 30)
println(person.greet()) // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

**Key Points:**

- **Primary Constructor:** The `Person` class has a primary constructor with parameters `name` and `age`. These parameters are automatically converted into fields due to the `val` keyword.
- **Methods:** The `greet` method demonstrates how behavior is encapsulated within a class.

#### Objects in Scala

Objects in Scala are single instances of their own definition, similar to the Singleton pattern in other languages. They are used to hold static methods and values.

```scala
// Define an object in Scala
object MathUtils {
  def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
}

// Access the method without instantiation
println(MathUtils.add(5, 3)) // Output: 8
```

**Key Points:**

- **Singleton Nature:** An object is instantiated once and can be accessed globally.
- **Utility Methods:** Objects are often used for utility functions that don't require state.

#### Companion Objects

Companion objects in Scala are objects with the same name as a class and are defined in the same file. They can access the private members of the class.

```scala
class Circle(val radius: Double) {
  import Circle._
  def area: Double = pi * radius * radius
}

object Circle {
  private val pi = 3.14159
}

// Instantiate and use the class
val circle = new Circle(5.0)
println(circle.area) // Output: 78.53975
```

**Key Points:**

- **Access to Private Members:** The companion object `Circle` can access the private `pi` value.
- **Factory Methods:** Companion objects are often used to implement factory methods for creating instances of the class.

### Inheritance and Method Overriding

Inheritance in Scala allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class structures.

#### Inheritance

Scala supports single inheritance, where a class can extend another class.

```scala
// Base class
class Animal {
  def speak(): String = "Some sound"
}

// Derived class
class Dog extends Animal {
  override def speak(): String = "Woof"
}

// Instantiate and use the derived class
val dog = new Dog
println(dog.speak()) // Output: Woof
```

**Key Points:**

- **`extends` Keyword:** Used to inherit from a base class.
- **Method Overriding:** The `Dog` class overrides the `speak` method to provide specific behavior.

#### Method Overriding

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```scala
class Vehicle {
  def start(): Unit = println("Vehicle started")
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  override def start(): Unit = println("Car started")
}

// Instantiate and use the classes
val vehicle = new Vehicle
vehicle.start() // Output: Vehicle started

val car = new Car
car.start() // Output: Car started
```

**Key Points:**

- **`override` Keyword:** Used to indicate that a method is being overridden.
- **Polymorphism:** Subclasses can be treated as instances of their superclass, allowing for dynamic method dispatch.

### Abstract Classes

Abstract classes in Scala are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and are meant to be extended by other classes. They can contain both abstract and concrete methods.

```scala
// Define an abstract class
abstract class Shape {
  def area: Double // Abstract method
  def perimeter: Double // Abstract method
}

// Concrete class extending the abstract class
class Rectangle(val width: Double, val height: Double) extends Shape {
  def area: Double = width * height
  def perimeter: Double = 2 * (width + height)
}

// Instantiate and use the concrete class
val rectangle = new Rectangle(4.0, 5.0)
println(s"Area: ${rectangle.area}, Perimeter: ${rectangle.perimeter}")
// Output: Area: 20.0, Perimeter: 18.0
```

**Key Points:**

- **Abstract Methods:** Methods without implementation that must be implemented by subclasses.
- **Concrete Methods:** Abstract classes can also have fully implemented methods.

### Design Considerations

When designing with Scala's object-oriented features, consider the following:

- **Encapsulation:** Use classes to encapsulate data and behavior, ensuring that internal states are protected.
- **Reusability:** Leverage inheritance to promote code reuse, but be cautious of deep inheritance hierarchies that can complicate maintenance.
- **Polymorphism:** Utilize polymorphism to design flexible and extensible systems.
- **Abstract Classes vs. Traits:** Choose between abstract classes and traits based on the need for state and multiple inheritance.

### Differences and Similarities

While Scala's object-oriented features are similar to those in other languages like Java, there are key differences:

- **Traits vs. Abstract Classes:** Traits in Scala are similar to interfaces in Java but can contain concrete methods and fields. They support multiple inheritance, unlike abstract classes.
- **Companion Objects:** Unique to Scala, they provide a way to define static members and factory methods.
- **Unified Type System:** Scala's type system unifies primitive types and objects, unlike Java's distinction between primitives and objects.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code snippets to deepen your understanding:

1. **Modify the `Person` class** to include a method that calculates the year of birth based on the current year.
2. **Create a new class `Cat`** that extends the `Animal` class and overrides the `speak` method to return "Meow".
3. **Implement a companion object** for a `Book` class that includes a factory method for creating `Book` instances with default values.

### Visualizing Scala's Object-Oriented Features

To better understand the relationships between classes, objects, and inheritance in Scala, let's visualize these concepts using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Person {
        +String name
        +int age
        +greet() String
    }
    class MathUtils {
        +add(x: Int, y: Int) Int
    }
    class Circle {
        +Double radius
        +area() Double
    }
    class Animal {
        +speak() String
    }
    class Dog {
        +speak() String
    }
    class Vehicle {
        +start() Unit
    }
    class Car {
        +start() Unit
    }
    class Shape {
        +area() Double
        +perimeter() Double
    }
    class Rectangle {
        +Double width
        +Double height
        +area() Double
        +perimeter() Double
    }
    MathUtils <|-- Circle : companion
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Vehicle <|-- Car
    Shape <|-- Rectangle
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Person Class:** Demonstrates a simple class with fields and methods.
- **MathUtils Object:** Represents a singleton object with a utility method.
- **Circle and Companion Object:** Shows how a companion object can access private members.
- **Inheritance:** Illustrates how `Dog` and `Car` extend `Animal` and `Vehicle`, respectively.
- **Abstract Class and Subclass:** Depicts `Shape` as an abstract class with `Rectangle` as its concrete implementation.
