   ```scala
   libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafx" % "16.0.0-R25"
   ```

3. **Create a Simple ScalaFX Application**: Here's a basic example to demonstrate a simple ScalaFX application:

   ```scala
   import scalafx.application.JFXApp
   import scalafx.scene.Scene
   import scalafx.scene.control.Label

   object HelloWorld extends JFXApp {
     stage = new JFXApp.PrimaryStage {
       title = "Hello ScalaFX"
       scene = new Scene {
         content = new Label("Hello, ScalaFX!")
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   This code creates a window with a label displaying "Hello, ScalaFX!".

#### Advanced ScalaFX Features

ScalaFX provides advanced features such as animations, 3D graphics, and media playback. Let's explore some of these capabilities:

- **Animations**: You can create animations using the `Timeline` and `KeyFrame` classes. Here's an example of a simple animation:

  ```scala
  import scalafx.animation.{KeyFrame, Timeline}
  import scalafx.util.Duration

  val timeline = new Timeline {
    keyFrames = Seq(
      KeyFrame(Duration(0), onFinished = () => println("Start")),
      KeyFrame(Duration(1000), onFinished = () => println("End"))
    )
  }
  timeline.play()
  ```

- **3D Graphics**: ScalaFX supports 3D graphics, allowing you to create complex visualizations. You can use the `Box`, `Sphere`, and `Cylinder` classes to create 3D shapes.

1. **Install Scala Native**: Ensure you have the Scala Native toolchain installed on your system.
2. **Set Up Your Project**: Create a new Scala Native project using sbt:

   ```bash
   sbt new scala-native/scala-native.g8
   ```

3. **Write Your Application**: Here's a simple example of a Scala Native application that prints "Hello, Scala Native!":

   ```scala
   object HelloWorld {
     def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
       println("Hello, Scala Native!")
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Build and Run**: Use sbt to compile and run your application:

   ```bash
   sbt run
   ```

#### Advanced Scala Native Features

Scala Native provides advanced features such as FFI (Foreign Function Interface) and memory management. Let's explore these capabilities:

- **FFI**: Scala Native's FFI allows you to call C functions directly from Scala code. Here's an example of using FFI to call a C function:

  ```scala
  import scala.scalanative.unsafe._
  import scala.scalanative.libc.stdlib._

  @extern
  object CFunctions {
    def printf(format: CString, args: CVararg*): CInt = extern
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    Zone { implicit z =>
      CFunctions.printf(c"Hello, %s!\n", c"Scala Native")
    }
  }
  ```

- **Memory Management**: Scala Native provides manual memory management capabilities, allowing you to allocate and deallocate memory as needed.

#### Design Considerations

When developing mobile applications with Scala Native, consider the following:

- **Platform-Specific APIs**: Be mindful of platform-specific APIs and ensure compatibility across different devices.
- **Resource Management**: Manage resources efficiently to optimize performance and battery life.
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.
