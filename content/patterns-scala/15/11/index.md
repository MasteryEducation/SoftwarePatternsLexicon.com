## 15.11 Data Privacy and Compliance

In today's digital age, data privacy and compliance have become critical components of software development. With regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws, software engineers and architects must design systems that prioritize user privacy and ensure compliance. In this section, we will explore how to implement privacy by design in Scala applications, along with techniques for data anonymization and pseudonymization.

### Understanding GDPR and Other Data Protection Laws

The GDPR is a comprehensive data protection law that governs how personal data of individuals within the European Union (EU) is collected, processed, and stored. It emphasizes user consent, data minimization, and the right to access and delete personal data. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines, making it crucial for developers to understand and implement its requirements.

#### Key Principles of GDPR

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: Data processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Data should be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
3. **Data Minimization**: Only data necessary for the intended purpose should be collected.
4. **Accuracy**: Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date.
5. **Storage Limitation**: Data should be kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary.
6. **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Data must be processed securely to protect against unauthorized processing and accidental loss.

#### Other Data Protection Laws

While GDPR is a prominent regulation, other regions have their own data protection laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada. Understanding these laws is crucial for global applications.

### Implementing Privacy by Design in Scala Applications

Privacy by design is a proactive approach to data protection, ensuring privacy is considered throughout the software development lifecycle. Here are some strategies to implement privacy by design in Scala applications:

#### 1. Data Minimization

Ensure that your application collects only the necessary data. Use Scala's strong typing system to enforce data constraints and prevent unnecessary data collection.

```scala
case class UserData(name: String, email: String, age: Option[Int])

def collectUserData(input: Map[String, String]): UserData = {
  UserData(
    name = input.getOrElse("name", ""),
    email = input.getOrElse("email", ""),
    age = input.get("age").flatMap(s => Try(s.toInt).toOption)
  )
}
```

#### 2. Secure Data Storage

Use encryption to protect sensitive data. Scala libraries like `Bouncy Castle` provide robust encryption mechanisms.

```scala
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
import java.security.Security
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec

Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider())

def encryptData(data: String, key: String): Array[Byte] = {
  val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding", "BC")
  val secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes("UTF-8"), "AES")
  cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
  cipher.doFinal(data.getBytes("UTF-8"))
}
```

#### 3. User Consent Management

Implement mechanisms to obtain and manage user consent. Use Scala's functional programming features to handle consent workflows.

```scala
sealed trait Consent
case object Granted extends Consent
case object Denied extends Consent

def requestConsent(userId: String): Consent = {
  // Logic to request and record user consent
  Granted // Example response
}
```

#### 4. Access Control and Auditing

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data. Use Scala's case classes and pattern matching for efficient access control logic.

```scala
sealed trait Role
case object Admin extends Role
case object User extends Role

case class User(id: String, role: Role)

def hasAccess(user: User, resource: String): Boolean = user.role match {
  case Admin => true
  case User => resource != "adminResource"
}
```

#### 5. Data Breach Response

Prepare a response plan for data breaches. Use Scala's `Try` and `Either` types for error handling and logging.

```scala
import scala.util.{Try, Success, Failure}

def handleDataBreach(): Try[Unit] = {
  // Logic to handle data breach
  Success(println("Data breach handled"))
}

handleDataBreach() match {
  case Success(_) => println("Breach handled successfully")
  case Failure(exception) => println(s"Error handling breach: ${exception.getMessage}")
}
```

### Techniques for Data Anonymization and Pseudonymization

Data anonymization and pseudonymization are techniques to protect personal data by making it less identifiable. These techniques are crucial for compliance with data protection laws.

#### Data Anonymization

Anonymization involves removing or altering data so that individuals cannot be identified. This process is irreversible.

##### Example: Removing Identifiers

```scala
case class UserRecord(id: String, name: String, email: String)

def anonymizeData(records: List[UserRecord]): List[UserRecord] = {
  records.map(record => record.copy(id = "", name = "Anonymous", email = ""))
}
```

#### Data Pseudonymization

Pseudonymization replaces private identifiers with fake identifiers or pseudonyms. This process is reversible under certain conditions.

##### Example: Hashing Identifiers

```scala
import java.security.MessageDigest

def hashIdentifier(identifier: String): String = {
  val md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")
  md.digest(identifier.getBytes("UTF-8")).map("%02x".format(_)).mkString
}

val pseudonymizedId = hashIdentifier("user123")
```

### Visualizing Data Privacy and Compliance
