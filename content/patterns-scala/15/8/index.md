## 15.8 Handling Sensitive Data

Handling sensitive data is a critical aspect of software development, especially in today's world where data breaches and cyber threats are prevalent. In this section, we will explore various strategies and best practices for encrypting and safeguarding sensitive information in Scala applications. We will delve into encryption techniques, key management, secure data storage, and transmission, as well as provide practical code examples to illustrate these concepts.

### Introduction to Data Sensitivity

Sensitive data refers to any information that must be protected from unauthorized access to safeguard the privacy or security of individuals or organizations. This includes personal data (like social security numbers, credit card information), business secrets, and other confidential information.

#### Why Protect Sensitive Data?

1. **Legal Compliance**: Many jurisdictions have laws that mandate the protection of personal data, such as GDPR in Europe and HIPAA in the United States.
2. **Reputation Management**: Data breaches can severely damage an organization's reputation.
3. **Financial Protection**: Preventing unauthorized access can save organizations from financial losses due to fraud or penalties.

### Encryption Basics

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and an encryption key. Only those with the correct decryption key can convert the ciphertext back into readable plaintext.

#### Types of Encryption

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It's fast and suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private). It's more secure for transmitting data but slower than symmetric encryption.

### Implementing Encryption in Scala

Scala, being a JVM language, can leverage Java's extensive cryptography libraries. Let's explore how to implement both symmetric and asymmetric encryption in Scala.

#### Symmetric Encryption with AES

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm. Here's how you can implement AES encryption in Scala:

```scala
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator
import javax.crypto.SecretKey
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec
import java.util.Base64

object SymmetricEncryption {

  def generateKey(): SecretKey = {
    val keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")
    keyGen.init(128) // for AES-128
    keyGen.generateKey()
  }

  def encrypt(data: String, secretKey: SecretKey): String = {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES")
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
    val encryptedData = cipher.doFinal(data.getBytes("UTF-8"))
    Base64.getEncoder.encodeToString(encryptedData)
  }

  def decrypt(encryptedData: String, secretKey: SecretKey): String = {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES")
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
    val decodedData = Base64.getDecoder.decode(encryptedData)
    new String(cipher.doFinal(decodedData), "UTF-8")
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val secretKey = generateKey()
    val originalData = "Sensitive Information"
    val encryptedData = encrypt(originalData, secretKey)
    val decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, secretKey)

    println(s"Original Data: $originalData")
    println(s"Encrypted Data: $encryptedData")
    println(s"Decrypted Data: $decryptedData")
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Key Generation**: We use a `KeyGenerator` to create a new AES key.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: The `Cipher` class handles both processes, using the same key.

#### Asymmetric Encryption with RSA

RSA is a popular asymmetric encryption algorithm. Here's how you can implement RSA encryption in Scala:

```scala
import java.security.{KeyPair, KeyPairGenerator, PrivateKey, PublicKey}
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import java.util.Base64

object AsymmetricEncryption {

  def generateKeyPair(): KeyPair = {
    val keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA")
    keyGen.initialize(2048)
    keyGen.generateKeyPair()
  }

  def encrypt(data: String, publicKey: PublicKey): String = {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA")
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey)
    val encryptedData = cipher.doFinal(data.getBytes("UTF-8"))
    Base64.getEncoder.encodeToString(encryptedData)
  }

  def decrypt(encryptedData: String, privateKey: PrivateKey): String = {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA")
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey)
    val decodedData = Base64.getDecoder.decode(encryptedData)
    new String(cipher.doFinal(decodedData), "UTF-8")
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val keyPair = generateKeyPair()
    val originalData = "Sensitive Information"
    val encryptedData = encrypt(originalData, keyPair.getPublic)
    val decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, keyPair.getPrivate)

    println(s"Original Data: $originalData")
    println(s"Encrypted Data: $encryptedData")
    println(s"Decrypted Data: $decryptedData")
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Key Pair Generation**: We generate a pair of keys (public and private) using `KeyPairGenerator`.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: The `Cipher` class is used with the appropriate key for each process.

### Key Management

Effective key management is crucial for ensuring the security of encrypted data. Here are some best practices:

1. **Key Storage**: Store keys securely, separate from the encrypted data. Consider using a dedicated key management system (KMS).
2. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate keys to minimize the risk of compromise.
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to keys to only those who absolutely need it.

### Secure Data Storage

When storing sensitive data, consider the following strategies:

- **Encrypt Data at Rest**: Ensure that data stored in databases or file systems is encrypted.
- **Use Secure Storage Solutions**: Utilize secure storage services that provide built-in encryption, such as AWS S3 with server-side encryption.

### Secure Data Transmission

To protect data in transit, use secure protocols such as HTTPS or TLS. Here's how you can set up a simple HTTPS server in Scala using Akka HTTP:

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.http.scaladsl.Http
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.Directives._
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.Route
import akka.http.scaladsl.settings.ServerSettings
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory

object SecureServer {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("secure-server")

    val route: Route = path("secure") {
      get {
        complete("Secure Data Transmission")
      }
    }

    val config = ConfigFactory.load()
    val httpsSettings = ServerSettings(config)

    Http().newServerAt("localhost", 8443)
      .enableHttps(httpsSettings)
      .bind(route)
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **HTTPS Setup**: Use Akka HTTP to set up a server with HTTPS enabled.
- **Secure Configuration**: Ensure that your server is configured to use strong ciphers and protocols.

### Try It Yourself
