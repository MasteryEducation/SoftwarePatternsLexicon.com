## 15.7 Secure Proxy Pattern

In the realm of software design, ensuring secure access to resources is paramount. The Secure Proxy Pattern is a powerful tool in this regard, providing a mechanism to control and monitor access to objects. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where direct access to an object is either too costly or needs to be controlled for security reasons. In this section, we'll delve into the Secure Proxy Pattern, its implementation in Scala, and how it can be leveraged to enhance security in your applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Secure Proxy Pattern is to act as an intermediary for another object to control access to it. This pattern can be used to add an additional layer of security, logging, or access control, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

### Key Participants

1. **Subject**: Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
2. **RealSubject**: The actual object that the proxy represents.
3. **Proxy**: Maintains a reference to the RealSubject and provides an interface identical to the Subject. It controls access to the RealSubject and may be responsible for creating and deleting it.

### Applicability

Use the Secure Proxy Pattern when:

- You need to control access to an object.
- You want to add additional functionality, such as logging or access control, without changing the original object's code.
- You want to defer the cost of creating an object until it is needed.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore how the Secure Proxy Pattern can be implemented in Scala. We'll create a simple example where a proxy controls access to a secure document.

```scala
// Define the Subject trait
trait Document {
  def display(): Unit
}

// Implement the RealSubject class
class SecureDocument extends Document {
  override def display(): Unit = {
    println("Displaying the secure document.")
  }
}

// Implement the Proxy class
class DocumentProxy(user: String, password: String) extends Document {
  private val secureDocument = new SecureDocument()

  private def authenticate(): Boolean = {
    // Simulate authentication logic
    user == "admin" && password == "admin123"
  }

  override def display(): Unit = {
    if (authenticate()) {
      secureDocument.display()
    } else {
      println("Access Denied: Invalid credentials.")
    }
  }
}

// Usage
object SecureProxyExample extends App {
  val documentProxy = new DocumentProxy("admin", "admin123")
  documentProxy.display() // Should display the document

  val invalidProxy = new DocumentProxy("user", "wrongpassword")
  invalidProxy.display() // Should deny access
}
```

In this example, the `DocumentProxy` class acts as a proxy for the `SecureDocument`. It controls access by requiring authentication before allowing the `display` method to be called on the `SecureDocument`.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Secure Proxy Pattern, consider the following:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure that the proxy performs robust authentication and authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of the performance overhead introduced by the proxy, especially if it involves complex authentication logic.
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the proxy can handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

### Differences and Similarities

The Secure Proxy Pattern is often confused with other proxy patterns such as the Virtual Proxy or Remote Proxy. The key distinction lies in its focus on security and access control. While a Virtual Proxy might defer object creation for performance reasons, a Secure Proxy primarily aims to enforce security policies.

### Visualizing the Secure Proxy Pattern

To better understand the Secure Proxy Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the components using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy
    participant RealSubject

    Client->>Proxy: Request access
    Proxy->>Proxy: Authenticate
    alt Authentication successful
        Proxy->>RealSubject: Forward request
        RealSubject->>Proxy: Return result
        Proxy->>Client: Return result
    else Authentication failed
        Proxy->>Client: Access Denied
    end
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of a request from the client to the proxy, and then to the real subject if authentication is successful.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code example:

- Implement a logging mechanism in the proxy to record each access attempt.
- Enhance the authentication logic to include role-based access control.
- Experiment with different authentication methods, such as token-based authentication.
