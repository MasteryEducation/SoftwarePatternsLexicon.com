## 7.10 Memoization

Memoization is a powerful optimization technique used in software engineering to improve the performance of functions by caching their results. This approach is particularly effective in functional programming languages like Scala, where functions are often pure and deterministic. In this section, we will explore the concept of memoization in detail, understand its benefits, and learn how to implement it in Scala.

### Understanding Memoization

Memoization is a specific form of caching that involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique is especially useful for functions that are called repeatedly with the same arguments, as it avoids redundant calculations and reduces computational overhead.

#### Key Concepts

- **Cache**: A storage layer that holds the results of previous computations.
- **Function Purity**: Memoization works best with pure functions, which always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
- **Determinism**: The function's output is solely determined by its input values.

### Benefits of Memoization

Memoization offers several advantages, particularly in performance-critical applications:

- **Improved Performance**: By avoiding repeated calculations, memoization can significantly speed up function execution.
- **Reduced Computational Load**: It decreases the overall computational resources required, which is beneficial in resource-constrained environments.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Applications can handle larger workloads more efficiently.

### Implementing Memoization in Scala

Scala, with its functional programming capabilities, provides an ideal environment for implementing memoization. Let's explore different techniques to achieve memoization in Scala.

#### Basic Memoization with Mutable Maps

One of the simplest ways to implement memoization in Scala is by using a mutable map to store cached results. Here's a basic example:

```scala
object MemoizationExample {
  def memoize[A, B](f: A => B): A => B = {
    val cache = scala.collection.mutable.Map.empty[A, B]
    (x: A) =>
      cache.getOrElseUpdate(x, f(x))
  }

  def expensiveComputation(x: Int): Int = {
    println(s"Computing for $x")
    x * x // Example of an expensive computation
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val memoizedComputation = memoize(expensiveComputation)
    println(memoizedComputation(5)) // Computes and caches
    println(memoizedComputation(5)) // Retrieves from cache
  }
}
```

In this example, the `memoize` function takes a function `f` and returns a new function that caches results in a mutable map. The `getOrElseUpdate` method is used to either retrieve a cached result or compute and store a new result.

#### Immutable Memoization with Functional Collections

While mutable maps are straightforward, they don't align with Scala's functional programming principles. Let's implement memoization using immutable collections:

```scala
object ImmutableMemoization {
  def memoize[A, B](f: A => B): A => B = {
    var cache = Map.empty[A, B]
    (x: A) =>
      cache.get(x) match {
        case Some(result) => result
        case None =>
          val result = f(x)
          cache += (x -> result)
          result
      }
  }

  def expensiveComputation(x: Int): Int = {
    println(s"Computing for $x")
    x * x
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val memoizedComputation = memoize(expensiveComputation)
    println(memoizedComputation(5))
    println(memoizedComputation(5))
  }
}
```

Here, we use an immutable `Map` to store cached results. The cache is updated by creating a new map with the additional entry, preserving immutability.

### Advanced Memoization Techniques

For more advanced use cases, we can leverage Scala's powerful features and libraries to implement memoization.

#### Using Scala's `Lazy` for Memoization

Scala's `lazy` keyword can be used to defer computation until a value is needed, which can be combined with memoization:

```scala
object LazyMemoization {
  def memoize[A, B](f: A => B): A => B = {
    val cache = scala.collection.mutable.Map.empty[A, B]
    (x: A) => cache.getOrElseUpdate(x, f(x))
  }

  lazy val expensiveComputation: Int => Int = memoize { x =>
    println(s"Computing for $x")
    x * x
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(expensiveComputation(5))
    println(expensiveComputation(5))
  }
}
```

In this example, `expensiveComputation` is defined as a lazy value, ensuring that it is only computed when accessed.

#### Memoization with `Cats` Library

The `Cats` library provides functional programming abstractions that can be used to implement memoization in a more idiomatic way. Here's an example using `Cats`:

```scala
import cats.effect.IO
import scala.collection.mutable

object CatsMemoization {
  def memoize[A, B](f: A => IO[B]): A => IO[B] = {
    val cache = mutable.Map.empty[A, IO[B]]
    (x: A) => cache.getOrElseUpdate(x, f(x))
  }

  def expensiveComputation(x: Int): IO[Int] = IO {
    println(s"Computing for $x")
    x * x
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val memoizedComputation = memoize(expensiveComputation)
    memoizedComputation(5).unsafeRunSync()
    memoizedComputation(5).unsafeRunSync()
  }
}
```

The `Cats` library allows us to work with effects, making it suitable for memoizing computations that involve side effects.

### Design Considerations

When implementing memoization, consider the following:

- **Cache Size**: Limit the size of the cache to prevent excessive memory usage.
- **Concurrency**: Ensure thread safety when accessing and updating the cache.
- **Eviction Policy**: Implement strategies to remove stale or least-used entries from the cache.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

Memoization is often confused with other caching techniques. Here are some distinctions:

- **Memoization vs. Caching**: While both store results for reuse, memoization is specific to function calls, whereas caching can apply to broader contexts.
- **Memoization vs. Lazy Evaluation**: Lazy evaluation defers computation, while memoization caches results. They can be used together for optimal performance.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the memoization examples provided. Try modifying the `expensiveComputation` function to simulate different scenarios, such as varying computational complexity or introducing side effects. Observe how memoization impacts performance and behavior.

### Visualizing Memoization

To better understand memoization, let's visualize the process using a flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is result cached?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return cached result]
    B -- No --> D[Compute result]
    D --> E[Cache result]
    E --> C
```

This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process in a memoized function: checking the cache, computing the result if necessary, and storing the result for future use.
