## 7.1 Lenses and Optics

In the world of functional programming, immutability is a core principle that brings numerous benefits, such as easier reasoning about code, thread safety, and reduced side effects. However, immutability also presents challenges, especially when dealing with deeply nested data structures. This is where lenses and optics come into play, offering elegant solutions for accessing and updating immutable data structures in a concise and expressive manner.

### Introduction to Lenses and Optics

Lenses and optics are powerful abstractions that allow us to focus on specific parts of a data structure, enabling us to read and update these parts without mutating the original structure. These concepts are particularly useful in functional programming languages like Scala, where immutability is a common practice.

#### What are Lenses?

A lens is a first-class abstraction that represents a focus on a particular part of a data structure. It provides two main operations:

1. **Get**: Extracts a value from a data structure.
2. **Set**: Produces a new data structure with a modified value.

Lenses are composable, meaning you can combine multiple lenses to focus on nested structures.

#### What are Optics?

Optics is a broader term that encompasses various types of abstractions for manipulating data structures, including lenses, prisms, and more. Each type of optic serves a different purpose:

- **Lenses**: Focus on a single field within a product type (e.g., case class).
- **Prisms**: Focus on a single variant within a sum type (e.g., sealed trait).
- **Iso**: Represents an isomorphism between two types, allowing bidirectional transformations.
- **Traversal**: Focuses on multiple parts of a data structure, allowing operations on collections.

### Why Use Lenses and Optics?

Lenses and optics provide several advantages when working with immutable data structures:

- **Conciseness**: They reduce boilerplate code by abstracting common patterns of data access and modification.
- **Composability**: They can be composed to focus on deeply nested structures, making code more modular and reusable.
- **Safety**: They maintain immutability, ensuring that original data structures remain unchanged.
- **Expressiveness**: They allow you to express complex data manipulations in a declarative manner.

### Using Libraries like Monocle

Scala's ecosystem offers powerful libraries for working with lenses and optics, with Monocle being one of the most popular choices. Monocle provides a comprehensive set of optics, including lenses, prisms, isos, and traversals, along with utilities for composing and applying them.

#### Setting Up Monocle

To get started with Monocle, you need to add it as a dependency in your Scala project. If you're using SBT, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.julien-truffaut" %% "monocle-core" % "3.0.0"
libraryDependencies += "com.github.julien-truffaut" %% "monocle-macro" % "3.0.0"
```

#### Basic Usage of Lenses

Let's explore how to use lenses with Monocle to manipulate nested data structures.

Consider the following case classes representing a simple address book:

```scala
case class Address(street: String, city: String)
case class Contact(name: String, address: Address)
```

Suppose we want to update the city of a contact's address. Without lenses, this would require verbose and error-prone code. With Monocle, we can define a lens to focus on the city field:

```scala
import monocle.Lens
import monocle.macros.GenLens

val addressCityLens: Lens[Address, String] = GenLens[Address](_.city)
val contactAddressLens: Lens[Contact, Address] = GenLens[Contact](_.address)

// Composing lenses to focus on the city field within a contact
val contactCityLens: Lens[Contact, String] = contactAddressLens.composeLens(addressCityLens)

// Using the lens to update the city
val contact = Contact("John Doe", Address("123 Main St", "Old City"))
val updatedContact = contactCityLens.modify(_ => "New City")(contact)

println(updatedContact) // Contact(John Doe,Address(123 Main St,New City))
```

In this example, we define lenses for the `city` field of `Address` and the `address` field of `Contact`. By composing these lenses, we create a lens that focuses on the city field within a contact. We then use this lens to update the city in a concise and expressive manner.

### Composing Optics for Complex Data Access and Updates

One of the key strengths of optics is their composability. By composing different types of optics, you can perform complex data manipulations with ease.

#### Working with Prisms

Prisms are used to focus on a specific variant of a sum type. Consider the following sealed trait representing a shape:

```scala
sealed trait Shape
case class Circle(radius: Double) extends Shape
case class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends Shape
```

Suppose we want to update the radius of a circle. We can define a prism to focus on the `Circle` variant:

```scala
import monocle.Prism
import monocle.macros.GenPrism

val circlePrism: Prism[Shape, Circle] = GenPrism[Shape, Circle]

// Using the prism to update the radius
val shape: Shape = Circle(5.0)
val updatedShape = circlePrism.modify(_.copy(radius = 10.0))(shape)

println(updatedShape) // Circle(10.0)
```

In this example, we define a prism for the `Circle` variant of `Shape`. We then use this prism to update the radius of a circle, demonstrating how prisms can simplify working with sum types.

#### Combining Lenses and Prisms

By combining lenses and prisms, you can focus on deeply nested structures within complex data types. Consider the following example:

```scala
case class Company(name: String, employees: List[Contact])

val companyEmployeesLens: Lens[Company, List[Contact]] = GenLens[Company](_.employees)

// Composing optics to focus on the city of the first employee
val firstEmployeeCityLens: Lens[Company, String] =
  companyEmployeesLens.composeLens(Lens.listHead[Contact]).composeLens(contactCityLens)

// Using the composed lens to update the city of the first employee
val company = Company("Tech Corp", List(Contact("Alice", Address("456 Elm St", "Old Town"))))
val updatedCompany = firstEmployeeCityLens.modify(_ => "New Town")(company)

println(updatedCompany) // Company(Tech Corp,List(Contact(Alice,Address(456 Elm St,New Town))))
```

In this example, we define a lens for the `employees` field of `Company` and compose it with a lens focusing on the first employee's city. This demonstrates the power of optics in handling complex data manipulations.

### Visualizing Optics Composition

To better understand how optics composition works, let's visualize the process using a diagram. The following diagram illustrates the composition of lenses and prisms to focus on a specific field within a nested data structure.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Company] --> B[Employees (List[Contact])]
    B --> C[First Employee (Contact)]
    C --> D[Address]
    D --> E[City]
```

In this diagram, each node represents a focus point within the data structure, and the arrows indicate the composition of optics to reach the desired field.

### Advanced Optics: Iso and Traversal

In addition to lenses and prisms, Monocle provides other types of optics, such as iso and traversal, which offer additional capabilities for data manipulation.

#### Iso: Isomorphism Between Types

An iso represents a bidirectional transformation between two types. It allows you to convert between types while preserving structure. Consider the following example:

```scala
import monocle.Iso

val celsiusToFahrenheit: Iso[Double, Double] = Iso[Double, Double](c => c * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0)(f => (f - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0)

// Using the iso to convert temperatures
val celsius = 25.0
val fahrenheit = celsiusToFahrenheit.get(celsius)

println(fahrenheit) // 77.0

val convertedBack = celsiusToFahrenheit.reverseGet(fahrenheit)

println(convertedBack) // 25.0
```

In this example, we define an iso for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The iso provides `get` and `reverseGet` methods for bidirectional conversion.

#### Traversal: Focusing on Multiple Parts

A traversal allows you to focus on multiple parts of a data structure, enabling operations on collections. Consider the following example:

```scala
import monocle.Traversal
import monocle.function.all._

val allCitiesTraversal: Traversal[Company, String] =
  companyEmployeesLens.composeTraversal(Traversal.fromTraverse[List, Contact]).composeLens(contactCityLens)

// Using the traversal to update all cities
val companyWithMultipleEmployees = Company("Tech Corp", List(
  Contact("Alice", Address("456 Elm St", "Old Town")),
  Contact("Bob", Address("789 Maple Ave", "Old Town"))
))

val updatedCompanyWithMultipleEmployees = allCitiesTraversal.modify(_ => "New Town")(companyWithMultipleEmployees)

println(updatedCompanyWithMultipleEmployees)
// Company(Tech Corp,List(Contact(Alice,Address(456 Elm St,New Town)), Contact(Bob,Address(789 Maple Ave,New Town))))
```

In this example, we define a traversal to focus on the city field of all employees within a company. We then use this traversal to update the city for all employees, demonstrating the power of traversals for batch operations.

### Design Considerations

When using lenses and optics, there are several design considerations to keep in mind:

- **Performance**: While optics provide a convenient way to manipulate data, they may introduce overhead due to the creation of intermediate data structures. Consider the performance implications when working with large data sets.
- **Complexity**: Overuse of optics can lead to complex and hard-to-read code. Use optics judiciously and document their usage to maintain code clarity.
- **Library Support**: Ensure that the optics library you choose is well-maintained and compatible with your Scala version. Monocle is a popular choice with active development and community support.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

Lenses and optics are often compared to other patterns for data manipulation, such as:

- **Zippers**: Zippers provide a way to navigate and update data structures, similar to lenses. However, zippers maintain a focus on a single element, whereas lenses can focus on multiple elements through composition.
- **Functional Updates**: Functional updates involve copying and modifying data structures manually. Lenses abstract this process, providing a more declarative approach.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of lenses and optics, try modifying the code examples provided in this guide. Experiment with different compositions of lenses, prisms, and traversals to manipulate complex data structures. Consider the following exercises:

1. **Exercise 1**: Define a lens to focus on the `street` field of an `Address` and use it to update the street of a contact.
2. **Exercise 2**: Create a prism for the `Rectangle` variant of `Shape` and use it to update the width and height of a rectangle.
3. **Exercise 3**: Use a traversal to update the names of all employees in a company to uppercase.

### Conclusion

Lenses and optics are powerful tools for manipulating immutable data structures in Scala. By leveraging libraries like Monocle, you can perform complex data manipulations with ease, maintaining the benefits of immutability while reducing boilerplate code. As you continue to explore the world of functional programming, lenses and optics will become invaluable assets in your toolkit.

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive applications. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
