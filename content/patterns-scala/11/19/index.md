## 11.19 Event Sourcing in Microservices

Event sourcing is a powerful pattern for managing state in microservices architectures. It involves capturing all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events. This approach not only provides a reliable audit trail but also allows for rebuilding state by replaying events. In this section, we will delve into the concept of event sourcing, its benefits, and how to implement it using Akka Persistence in Scala.

### Understanding Event Sourcing

Event sourcing is a design pattern where state changes are logged as a series of events. Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store a sequence of state-changing events. This approach has several advantages:

- **Auditability**: Every change is recorded, providing a complete history.
- **Reproducibility**: You can recreate the state of the system at any point in time by replaying events.
- **Scalability**: Events can be distributed across systems, making it easier to scale.
- **Flexibility**: New features can be added by processing existing events differently.

### Key Concepts in Event Sourcing

Before we dive into implementation, let's clarify some key concepts:

- **Event**: A record of a state change. Events are immutable and represent facts that have occurred.
- **Event Store**: A database or storage system that holds events. It acts as the source of truth for the system.
- **Command**: An action that triggers an event. Commands are requests to perform operations.
- **Aggregate**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. Aggregates ensure consistency within their boundaries.

### Benefits of Event Sourcing in Microservices

Event sourcing offers several benefits, especially in microservices architectures:

- **Decoupled Services**: Services can react to events independently, promoting loose coupling.
- **Resilience**: Services can recover from failures by replaying events.
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency can be achieved across distributed systems.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Historical data can be analyzed for insights and trends.

### Implementing Event Sourcing with Akka Persistence

Akka Persistence is a powerful tool for implementing event sourcing in Scala. It provides a framework for persisting actor state as events, allowing you to build resilient, stateful applications.

#### Setting Up Akka Persistence

To get started with Akka Persistence, you need to add the necessary dependencies to your Scala project. Here's how you can do it using SBT:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-persistence" % "2.6.20"
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-persistence-query" % "2.6.20"
```

#### Defining Events and Commands

In an event-sourced system, you need to define the events and commands that your application will handle. Here's an example for a simple bank account application:

```scala
// Events
sealed trait AccountEvent
case class AccountCreated(accountId: String, initialBalance: Double) extends AccountEvent
case class MoneyDeposited(accountId: String, amount: Double) extends AccountEvent
case class MoneyWithdrawn(accountId: String, amount: Double) extends AccountEvent

// Commands
sealed trait AccountCommand
case class CreateAccount(accountId: String, initialBalance: Double) extends AccountCommand
case class DepositMoney(accountId: String, amount: Double) extends AccountCommand
case class WithdrawMoney(accountId: String, amount: Double) extends AccountCommand
```

#### Creating the Persistent Actor

A persistent actor is responsible for handling commands and persisting events. Here's how you can implement a persistent actor for the bank account example:

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorLogging
import akka.persistence.{PersistentActor, SnapshotOffer}

class BankAccountActor(accountId: String) extends PersistentActor with ActorLogging {
  override def persistenceId: String = s"bank-account-$accountId"

  private var balance: Double = 0.0

  override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
    case CreateAccount(_, initialBalance) =>
      persist(AccountCreated(accountId, initialBalance)) { event =>
        updateState(event)
        log.info(s"Account $accountId created with balance $initialBalance")
      }
    case DepositMoney(_, amount) =>
      persist(MoneyDeposited(accountId, amount)) { event =>
        updateState(event)
        log.info(s"Deposited $amount to account $accountId")
      }
    case WithdrawMoney(_, amount) if balance >= amount =>
      persist(MoneyWithdrawn(accountId, amount)) { event =>
        updateState(event)
        log.info(s"Withdrew $amount from account $accountId")
      }
    case WithdrawMoney(_, amount) =>
      log.warning(s"Insufficient balance to withdraw $amount from account $accountId")
  }

  override def receiveRecover: Receive = {
    case event: AccountEvent => updateState(event)
    case SnapshotOffer(_, snapshot: Double) => balance = snapshot
  }

  private def updateState(event: AccountEvent): Unit = event match {
    case AccountCreated(_, initialBalance) => balance = initialBalance
    case MoneyDeposited(_, amount) => balance += amount
    case MoneyWithdrawn(_, amount) => balance -= amount
  }
}
```

#### Handling Snapshots

Snapshots are used to optimize recovery by storing the state at a certain point in time. Akka Persistence allows you to take snapshots periodically to speed up the recovery process:

```scala
override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
  // ... existing command handling
  case SaveSnapshotSuccess(metadata) =>
    log.info(s"Snapshot saved successfully: $metadata")
  case SaveSnapshotFailure(metadata, reason) =>
    log.error(s"Failed to save snapshot: $metadata, reason: $reason")
}
```

#### Querying Events

Akka Persistence Query provides a way to query events from the event store. This is useful for building read models or integrating with other systems:

```scala
import akka.persistence.query.PersistenceQuery
import akka.persistence.query.scaladsl.ReadJournal
import akka.stream.scaladsl.Sink

val readJournal: ReadJournal = PersistenceQuery(system).readJournalFor[ReadJournal]("akka.persistence.query.journal.leveldb")

readJournal.eventsByPersistenceId("bank-account-123", 0L, Long.MaxValue)
  .runWith(Sink.foreach(event => println(s"Event: $event")))
```

### Visualizing Event Sourcing Architecture

To better understand the flow of event sourcing in a microservices architecture, let's visualize the process using a Mermaid.js sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Service
    participant EventStore
    participant ReadModel

    Client->>Service: Send Command
    Service->>EventStore: Persist Event
    EventStore->>Service: Acknowledge
    Service->>ReadModel: Update
    ReadModel->>Client: Respond
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of a command from the client to the service, the persistence of an event in the event store, and the subsequent update of the read model.

### Design Considerations

When implementing event sourcing, consider the following:

- **Event Versioning**: As your application evolves, the structure of events may change. Implement versioning to handle these changes gracefully.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Embrace eventual consistency in your system design. Ensure that services can handle eventual consistency gracefully.
- **Scalability**: Ensure that your event store can handle the volume of events generated by your application.
- **Security**: Protect sensitive data in events, especially if they contain personal or confidential information.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

Event sourcing is often confused with other patterns like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). While they complement each other, they serve different purposes:

- **Event Sourcing**: Focuses on persisting state changes as events.
- **CQRS**: Separates the read and write models for better scalability and performance.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying the commands and events. Try adding new features, such as transferring money between accounts, and observe how the system behaves.
