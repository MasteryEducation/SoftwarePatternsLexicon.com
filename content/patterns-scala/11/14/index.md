## 11.14 Saga Pattern

In the realm of microservices architecture, managing distributed transactions is a significant challenge. The Saga Pattern emerges as a robust solution to this problem, enabling systems to maintain eventual consistency across multiple services. In this section, we'll delve into the intricacies of the Saga Pattern, explore its implementation using Akka Persistence in Scala, and understand its role in achieving reliable distributed transactions.

### Intent

The Saga Pattern is designed to manage long-lived transactions in a distributed system. It breaks a transaction into a series of smaller, independent transactions, each with its own compensation logic to handle failures. This approach ensures that the system remains consistent even when individual transactions fail, by either completing all transactions successfully or compensating for any failures.

### Key Participants

1. **Saga Coordinator**: Manages the execution of the saga, ensuring that each step is executed in sequence and compensation actions are triggered in case of failures.
2. **Participants**: Individual services or components that perform specific tasks within the saga.
3. **Compensation Logic**: Defined for each participant to undo or mitigate the effects of a transaction if it fails.

### Applicability

The Saga Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:

- Transactions span multiple services or databases.
- Strong consistency is not feasible, and eventual consistency is acceptable.
- The system needs to remain operational despite partial failures.

### Implementing Sagas with Akka Persistence

Akka Persistence provides a powerful framework for implementing sagas in Scala. It allows you to persist state changes, ensuring that your system can recover from failures and continue processing transactions.

#### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a simple implementation of the Saga Pattern using Akka Persistence. We'll simulate a transaction involving two services: `OrderService` and `PaymentService`.

```scala
import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorLogging, Props}
import akka.persistence.{PersistentActor, RecoveryCompleted}

// Messages
case class StartOrder(orderId: String, amount: Double)
case class CompleteOrder(orderId: String)
case class CompensateOrder(orderId: String)

// Events
case class OrderStarted(orderId: String, amount: Double)
case class OrderCompleted(orderId: String)
case class OrderCompensated(orderId: String)

// OrderSaga Actor
class OrderSaga extends PersistentActor with ActorLogging {
  override def persistenceId: String = "order-saga"

  private var orderState: Option[OrderStarted] = None

  override def receiveRecover: Receive = {
    case event: OrderStarted =>
      orderState = Some(event)
    case _: OrderCompleted =>
      orderState = None
    case _: OrderCompensated =>
      orderState = None
    case RecoveryCompleted =>
      log.info("Recovery completed")
  }

  override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
    case StartOrder(orderId, amount) =>
      persist(OrderStarted(orderId, amount)) { event =>
        orderState = Some(event)
        log.info(s"Order started: $orderId")
        // Simulate payment processing
        context.actorOf(Props[PaymentService]) ! ProcessPayment(orderId, amount)
      }

    case CompleteOrder(orderId) =>
      persist(OrderCompleted(orderId)) { _ =>
        orderState = None
        log.info(s"Order completed: $orderId")
      }

    case CompensateOrder(orderId) =>
      persist(OrderCompensated(orderId)) { _ =>
        orderState = None
        log.info(s"Order compensated: $orderId")
      }
  }
}

// PaymentService Actor
class PaymentService extends Actor with ActorLogging {
  override def receive: Receive = {
    case ProcessPayment(orderId, amount) =>
      // Simulate payment logic
      if (amount > 1000) {
        sender() ! CompensateOrder(orderId)
      } else {
        sender() ! CompleteOrder(orderId)
      }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `OrderSaga` actor manages the transaction, while the `PaymentService` actor simulates a payment process. If the payment amount exceeds a certain threshold, the order is compensated.

#### Design Considerations

- **State Persistence**: Use Akka Persistence to ensure that the saga's state is durable. This allows the system to recover from failures and resume processing.
- **Compensation Logic**: Define clear compensation actions for each participant to handle failures gracefully.
- **Concurrency**: Manage concurrent sagas carefully to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency.

#### Differences and Similarities

The Saga Pattern is often compared to the traditional two-phase commit protocol. However, unlike two-phase commit, sagas do not lock resources, making them more suitable for distributed systems where availability and partition tolerance are prioritized over strong consistency.

### Visualizing the Saga Pattern

To better understand the flow of a saga, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant OrderSaga
    participant PaymentService
    Client->>OrderSaga: StartOrder
    OrderSaga->>PaymentService: ProcessPayment
    alt Payment Successful
        PaymentService-->>OrderSaga: CompleteOrder
        OrderSaga-->>Client: Order Completed
    else Payment Failed
        PaymentService-->>OrderSaga: CompensateOrder
        OrderSaga-->>Client: Order Compensated
    end
```

This diagram illustrates the interactions between the client, `OrderSaga`, and `PaymentService`. It shows how the saga handles both successful and failed transactions.
