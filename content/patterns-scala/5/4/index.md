## 5.4 Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In Scala, this pattern can be effectively implemented using traits, mixins, and the new extension methods introduced in Scala 3. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Decorator Pattern is to provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. By wrapping an object with a decorator, you can add new behaviors and responsibilities to the object without altering its structure.

### Key Participants

- **Component**: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
- **ConcreteComponent**: The class to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
- **Decorator**: Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.
- **ConcreteDecorator**: Adds responsibilities to the component.

### Applicability

Use the Decorator Pattern when:

- You want to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
- You want to avoid subclassing to extend functionality.
- You need to add responsibilities to an object that you cannot modify directly.

### Visualizing the Decorator Pattern

Let's visualize the Decorator Pattern using a class diagram to understand the relationships between the components.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation()
    }
    class Decorator {
        -component: Component
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecorator {
        +operation()
    }
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecorator
    Decorator o-- Component
```

**Diagram Description:** The diagram illustrates the relationship between the Component, ConcreteComponent, Decorator, and ConcreteDecorator classes. The Decorator class maintains a reference to a Component object and extends its functionality.

### Implementing the Decorator Pattern in Scala

In Scala, the Decorator Pattern can be implemented using traits and mixins. Let's explore how to achieve this with a practical example.

#### Example: Coffee Shop

Imagine a coffee shop where you can order a basic coffee and add various condiments like milk, sugar, and whipped cream. We'll use the Decorator Pattern to model this scenario.

```scala
// Define the Component trait
trait Coffee {
  def cost: Double
  def description: String
}

// ConcreteComponent
class SimpleCoffee extends Coffee {
  override def cost: Double = 5.0
  override def description: String = "Simple Coffee"
}

// Decorator
trait CoffeeDecorator extends Coffee {
  protected val coffee: Coffee
  override def cost: Double = coffee.cost
  override def description: String = coffee.description
}

// ConcreteDecorator for Milk
class MilkDecorator(val coffee: Coffee) extends CoffeeDecorator {
  override def cost: Double = coffee.cost + 1.5
  override def description: String = coffee.description + ", Milk"
}

// ConcreteDecorator for Sugar
class SugarDecorator(val coffee: Coffee) extends CoffeeDecorator {
  override def cost: Double = coffee.cost + 0.5
  override def description: String = coffee.description + ", Sugar"
}

// Usage
val myCoffee: Coffee = new SugarDecorator(new MilkDecorator(new SimpleCoffee))
println(s"Cost: ${myCoffee.cost}, Description: ${myCoffee.description}")
```

**Code Explanation:**

- **Component Trait**: `Coffee` defines the interface for coffee objects.
- **ConcreteComponent**: `SimpleCoffee` is a basic coffee with a fixed cost and description.
- **Decorator Trait**: `CoffeeDecorator` extends `Coffee` and maintains a reference to a `Coffee` object.
- **ConcreteDecorators**: `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` add additional costs and descriptions to the coffee.

### Using Extension Methods in Scala 3

Scala 3 introduces extension methods, which provide a more concise way to add functionality to existing types. Let's see how we can use extension methods to implement the Decorator Pattern.

#### Example: Coffee Shop with Extension Methods

```scala
// Define the Coffee trait
trait Coffee {
  def cost: Double
  def description: String
}

// ConcreteComponent
class SimpleCoffee extends Coffee {
  override def cost: Double = 5.0
  override def description: String = "Simple Coffee"
}

// Extension methods for Coffee
extension (coffee: Coffee)
  def withMilk: Coffee = new Coffee {
    override def cost: Double = coffee.cost + 1.5
    override def description: String = coffee.description + ", Milk"
  }

  def withSugar: Coffee = new Coffee {
    override def cost: Double = coffee.cost + 0.5
    override def description: String = coffee.description + ", Sugar"
  }

// Usage
val myCoffee: Coffee = SimpleCoffee().withMilk.withSugar
println(s"Cost: ${myCoffee.cost}, Description: ${myCoffee.description}")
```

**Code Explanation:**

- **Extension Methods**: We define extension methods `withMilk` and `withSugar` for the `Coffee` trait. These methods return a new `Coffee` instance with the added functionality.
- **Usage**: We can chain the extension methods to add multiple decorators to the coffee.

### Design Considerations

When using the Decorator Pattern in Scala, consider the following:

- **Immutability**: Ensure that decorators do not modify the state of the objects they decorate. Use immutable data structures where possible.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance overhead introduced by multiple layers of decorators.
- **Complexity**: Avoid excessive use of decorators, which can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code.

### Differences and Similarities

The Decorator Pattern is often confused with the Proxy Pattern. While both patterns involve a level of indirection, they serve different purposes:

- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Controls access to an object.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by adding new decorators, such as `WhippedCreamDecorator`, and see how they affect the cost and description of the coffee. Try using Scala 3 extension methods to implement additional functionalities.

### Knowledge Check

### Conclusion

The Decorator Pattern in Scala offers a powerful way to extend the functionality of objects dynamically. By leveraging traits, mixins, and extension methods, you can create flexible and reusable components that adhere to the Open/Closed Principle. Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive systems. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
