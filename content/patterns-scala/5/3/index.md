## 5.3 Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In Scala, the Composite Pattern is elegantly implemented using case classes and sealed traits, which provide a robust foundation for creating immutable and type-safe tree structures.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Composite Pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is particularly useful when dealing with tree structures such as file systems, organizational hierarchies, or graphical user interfaces.

### Key Participants

- **Component**: An abstract class or trait that defines the interface for all objects in the composition, both leaf and composite nodes.
- **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.
- **Composite**: Represents a composite node that can have children. It implements operations defined in the Component interface.

### Applicability

Use the Composite Pattern when:
- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- You want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.
- You need to implement tree structures where nodes and leaves are treated uniformly.

### Implementing Composite Structures with Case Classes and Sealed Traits

Scala's case classes and sealed traits provide an ideal mechanism for implementing the Composite Pattern. Let's explore how we can leverage these features to create a flexible and type-safe tree structure.

#### Step 1: Define the Component Trait

The Component trait serves as the base for both leaf and composite nodes. It defines the common interface for all nodes in the tree.

```scala
sealed trait Component {
  def operation(): String
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Leaf Nodes

Leaf nodes are the simplest form of components. They do not have any children and typically perform a specific operation.

```scala
case class Leaf(name: String) extends Component {
  override def operation(): String = s"Leaf: $name"
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement Composite Nodes

Composite nodes can have children, which are themselves components. This allows for recursive composition.

```scala
case class Composite(name: String, children: List[Component]) extends Component {
  override def operation(): String = {
    val childOperations = children.map(_.operation()).mkString(", ")
    s"Composite: $name with children [$childOperations]"
  }
}
```

### Sample Code Snippet

Here's a complete example demonstrating the Composite Pattern in Scala:

```scala
sealed trait Component {
  def operation(): String
}

case class Leaf(name: String) extends Component {
  override def operation(): String = s"Leaf: $name"
}

case class Composite(name: String, children: List[Component]) extends Component {
  override def operation(): String = {
    val childOperations = children.map(_.operation()).mkString(", ")
    s"Composite: $name with children [$childOperations]"
  }
}

object CompositePatternExample extends App {
  val leaf1 = Leaf("Leaf 1")
  val leaf2 = Leaf("Leaf 2")
  val composite1 = Composite("Composite 1", List(leaf1, leaf2))

  val leaf3 = Leaf("Leaf 3")
  val root = Composite("Root", List(composite1, leaf3))

  println(root.operation())
}
```

### Visualizing the Composite Pattern

To better understand the structure of the Composite Pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Component <|-- Leaf
    Component <|-- Composite
    class Component {
        <<trait>>
        +operation(): String
    }
    class Leaf {
        +name: String
        +operation(): String
    }
    class Composite {
        +name: String
        +children: List[Component]
        +operation(): String
    }
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Composite Pattern in Scala, consider the following:

- **Immutability**: Leverage Scala's immutable collections to ensure that your tree structures are immutable. This enhances safety and prevents unintended side effects.
- **Type Safety**: Use sealed traits to ensure that all possible subtypes are known at compile time, providing exhaustive pattern matching and reducing runtime errors.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of deep tree structures, especially when traversing or modifying them.

### Differences and Similarities

The Composite Pattern is often compared to other structural patterns such as the Decorator and Flyweight patterns. While all these patterns deal with object composition, they serve different purposes:

- **Decorator Pattern**: Focuses on adding responsibilities to individual objects dynamically without affecting other objects.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Aims to minimize memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects.
- **Composite Pattern**: Emphasizes tree structures and uniform treatment of nodes and leaves.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Composite Pattern, try modifying the code example:

- Add a method to count the total number of leaf nodes in the tree.
- Implement a method to find a leaf by name.
- Experiment with different tree structures and observe how the operations change.
