## 5.1 Adapter Pattern

In the realm of software design, the Adapter Pattern is a structural pattern that plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between incompatible interfaces. This pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate seamlessly. In Scala, the Adapter Pattern can be elegantly implemented using traits and implicit conversions, making it a powerful tool for expert software engineers and architects.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter Pattern is to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two objects, enabling them to communicate without altering their existing code. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems with new applications.

### Key Participants

1. **Target Interface**: The interface that the client expects to work with.
2. **Adaptee**: The existing interface that needs to be adapted.
3. **Adapter**: The class or object that bridges the gap between the Target and the Adaptee.
4. **Client**: The entity that uses the Target interface.

### Applicability

The Adapter Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You need to use an existing class, but its interface does not match the one you need.
- You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
- You need to integrate third-party libraries or legacy systems with your application.

### Implementing the Adapter Pattern in Scala

Scala offers unique features such as traits and implicit conversions, which can be leveraged to implement the Adapter Pattern effectively. Let's explore how these features can be used to create adapters.

#### Using Traits

Traits in Scala are similar to interfaces in Java but more powerful. They can contain method implementations and can be mixed into classes. Here's how you can use traits to implement the Adapter Pattern:

```scala
// Target Interface
trait MediaPlayer {
  def play(audioType: String, fileName: String): Unit
}

// Adaptee
class AdvancedMediaPlayer {
  def playVlc(fileName: String): Unit = println(s"Playing vlc file. Name: $fileName")
  def playMp4(fileName: String): Unit = println(s"Playing mp4 file. Name: $fileName")
}

// Adapter
class MediaAdapter extends MediaPlayer {
  private val advancedMusicPlayer = new AdvancedMediaPlayer

  override def play(audioType: String, fileName: String): Unit = {
    audioType.toLowerCase match {
      case "vlc" => advancedMusicPlayer.playVlc(fileName)
      case "mp4" => advancedMusicPlayer.playMp4(fileName)
      case _ => println(s"Invalid media. $audioType format not supported")
    }
  }
}

// Client
class AudioPlayer extends MediaPlayer {
  private val mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter

  override def play(audioType: String, fileName: String): Unit = {
    if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp3")) {
      println(s"Playing mp3 file. Name: $fileName")
    } else {
      mediaAdapter.play(audioType, fileName)
    }
  }
}

// Usage
val audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer
audioPlayer.play("mp3", "song.mp3")
audioPlayer.play("mp4", "video.mp4")
audioPlayer.play("vlc", "movie.vlc")
audioPlayer.play("avi", "documentary.avi")
```

In this example, `MediaAdapter` acts as the adapter that allows `AudioPlayer` to play different audio formats by adapting the `AdvancedMediaPlayer` interface.

#### Using Implicit Conversions

Implicit conversions in Scala provide a way to automatically convert one type to another. This feature can be used to implement the Adapter Pattern without explicitly defining an adapter class.

```scala
// Adaptee
class LegacyRectangle {
  def draw(x: Int, y: Int, width: Int, height: Int): Unit = {
    println(s"Drawing rectangle at ($x, $y) with width $width and height $height")
  }
}

// Target Interface
trait Shape {
  def draw(x: Int, y: Int, width: Int, height: Int): Unit
}

// Implicit Adapter
object ShapeAdapter {
  implicit def rectangleToShape(rectangle: LegacyRectangle): Shape = new Shape {
    override def draw(x: Int, y: Int, width: Int, height: Int): Unit = {
      rectangle.draw(x, y, width, height)
    }
  }
}

// Client
object DrawingApp extends App {
  val rectangle = new LegacyRectangle
  import ShapeAdapter._

  def drawShape(shape: Shape): Unit = {
    shape.draw(10, 20, 30, 40)
  }

  drawShape(rectangle)  // Implicit conversion happens here
}
```

In this example, the implicit conversion from `LegacyRectangle` to `Shape` allows the `DrawingApp` to use `LegacyRectangle` as if it were a `Shape`.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

To better understand the Adapter Pattern, let's visualize the relationships between the components using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class MediaPlayer {
        <<interface>>
        +play(audioType: String, fileName: String): Unit
    }
    class AdvancedMediaPlayer {
        +playVlc(fileName: String): Unit
        +playMp4(fileName: String): Unit
    }
    class MediaAdapter {
        +play(audioType: String, fileName: String): Unit
    }
    class AudioPlayer {
        +play(audioType: String, fileName: String): Unit
    }
    MediaPlayer <|-- AudioPlayer
    MediaPlayer <|-- MediaAdapter
    MediaAdapter --> AdvancedMediaPlayer
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Adapter Pattern in Scala, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Implicit conversions can introduce performance overhead. Use them judiciously.
- **Complexity**: Avoid overusing adapters, as they can make the codebase complex and hard to maintain.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the adapter correctly translates calls from the target interface to the adaptee.

### Differences and Similarities

The Adapter Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both patterns involve wrapping objects, they serve different purposes. The Adapter Pattern is used to make incompatible interfaces compatible, whereas the Decorator Pattern is used to add new functionality to an object without altering its structure.
