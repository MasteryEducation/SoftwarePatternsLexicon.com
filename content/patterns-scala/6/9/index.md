## 6.9 Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that enables you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms and make them easily swappable within your application. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to choose an algorithm at runtime, providing flexibility and promoting code reuse. In this section, we'll explore how to implement the Strategy Pattern in Scala, leveraging its functional programming capabilities and object-oriented features.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. In Scala, we can achieve this by using traits and passing strategies as function parameters.

### Key Participants

- **Strategy**: The interface or abstract class that defines the algorithm's structure.
- **Concrete Strategy**: Classes that implement the Strategy interface, each providing a specific algorithm.
- **Context**: The class that uses a Strategy to perform its task. It maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to it.

### Applicability

Use the Strategy Pattern when:

- You have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to switch between them easily.
- You want to avoid conditional statements for selecting algorithms.
- You need to encapsulate algorithms to make them interchangeable and reusable.

### Implementing the Strategy Pattern in Scala

Scala's rich type system and functional programming features make it an ideal language for implementing the Strategy Pattern. We'll explore two approaches: using traits and passing strategies as function parameters.

#### Using Traits

In Scala, traits can be used to define the Strategy interface. Each concrete strategy will implement this trait, providing its own version of the algorithm.

```scala
// Define the Strategy trait
trait PaymentStrategy {
  def pay(amount: Double): Unit
}

// Implement Concrete Strategies
class CreditCardStrategy(cardNumber: String, cvv: String) extends PaymentStrategy {
  override def pay(amount: Double): Unit = {
    println(s"Paying $$amount using Credit Card ending with ${cardNumber.takeRight(4)}")
  }
}

class PayPalStrategy(email: String) extends PaymentStrategy {
  override def pay(amount: Double): Unit = {
    println(s"Paying $$amount using PayPal account $email")
  }
}

// Context class that uses the Strategy
class ShoppingCart(var strategy: PaymentStrategy) {
  def checkout(amount: Double): Unit = {
    strategy.pay(amount)
  }
}

// Example usage
object StrategyPatternExample extends App {
  val cart = new ShoppingCart(new CreditCardStrategy("1234567890123456", "123"))
  cart.checkout(100.0)

  cart.strategy = new PayPalStrategy("user@example.com")
  cart.checkout(200.0)
}
```

In this example, `PaymentStrategy` is the trait that defines the algorithm interface. `CreditCardStrategy` and `PayPalStrategy` are concrete implementations of this trait. The `ShoppingCart` class acts as the context, using a `PaymentStrategy` to perform the payment operation.

#### Passing Strategies as Function Parameters

Scala's support for first-class functions allows us to pass strategies as function parameters, offering a more functional approach to the Strategy Pattern.

```scala
// Define the Strategy as a function type
type PaymentStrategy = Double => Unit

// Implement Concrete Strategies as functions
val creditCardStrategy: PaymentStrategy = amount => {
  println(s"Paying $$amount using Credit Card")
}

val payPalStrategy: PaymentStrategy = amount => {
  println(s"Paying $$amount using PayPal")
}

// Context class that uses the Strategy
class ShoppingCart(var strategy: PaymentStrategy) {
  def checkout(amount: Double): Unit = {
    strategy(amount)
  }
}

// Example usage
object StrategyPatternExample extends App {
  val cart = new ShoppingCart(creditCardStrategy)
  cart.checkout(100.0)

  cart.strategy = payPalStrategy
  cart.checkout(200.0)
}
```

Here, we define `PaymentStrategy` as a function type `Double => Unit`. The concrete strategies are implemented as functions, which are then passed to the `ShoppingCart` class.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Strategy Pattern in Scala, consider the following:

- **Immutability**: If possible, design your strategies to be immutable. This ensures thread safety and makes your code easier to reason about.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Scala's type system to enforce correct usage of strategies. Consider using type parameters if your strategies need to operate on different types.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of using higher-order functions, especially in performance-critical sections of your code.

### Differences and Similarities

The Strategy Pattern is often confused with the State Pattern. While both patterns involve changing behavior at runtime, the key difference is that the Strategy Pattern is used to switch between algorithms, whereas the State Pattern is used to change the object's behavior when its state changes.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

Let's visualize the Strategy Pattern using a class diagram to better understand the relationships between the components.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +pay(amount: Double)
    }
    class CreditCardStrategy {
        +pay(amount: Double)
    }
    class PayPalStrategy {
        +pay(amount: Double)
    }
    class ShoppingCart {
        -strategy: PaymentStrategy
        +checkout(amount: Double)
    }
    PaymentStrategy <|-- CreditCardStrategy
    PaymentStrategy <|-- PayPalStrategy
    ShoppingCart --> PaymentStrategy
```

This diagram illustrates how the `ShoppingCart` class interacts with the `PaymentStrategy` interface and its concrete implementations.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Strategy Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- Add a new payment strategy, such as a `BitcoinStrategy`.
- Implement a strategy that applies a discount before making a payment.
- Modify the `ShoppingCart` class to accept multiple strategies and apply them in sequence.
