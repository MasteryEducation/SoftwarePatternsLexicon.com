## 6.2 Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all the information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of methods with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests. It also provides support for undoable operations. In Scala, the Command Pattern can be elegantly implemented using first-class functions or case classes, leveraging Scala's functional programming capabilities to create immutable command objects.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Command Pattern is to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides a way to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver.

### Key Participants

1. **Command**: Declares an interface for executing an operation.
2. **ConcreteCommand**: Implements the Command interface and defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action.
3. **Client**: Creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.
4. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request.
5. **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.

### Applicability

Use the Command Pattern when you want to:

- Parameterize objects with operations.
- Queue operations for later execution.
- Support undo operations.
- Log changes to support auditing.

### Diagrams

Let's visualize the Command Pattern using a class diagram to understand the relationships between the components.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        <<interface>>
        +execute()
    }
    class ConcreteCommand {
        +execute()
    }
    class Invoker {
        +setCommand(Command)
        +executeCommand()
    }
    class Receiver {
        +action()
    }
    class Client {
        +main()
    }

    Command <|-- ConcreteCommand
    ConcreteCommand --> Receiver
    Invoker --> Command
    Client --> Invoker
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the Command Pattern's structure, showing how the `Invoker` interacts with the `Command` interface, which is implemented by `ConcreteCommand`. The `ConcreteCommand` is associated with a `Receiver` that performs the actual work.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a simple example of the Command Pattern in Scala, where we encapsulate actions as case classes.

```scala
// The Command interface
trait Command {
  def execute(): Unit
}

// Receiver class
class Light {
  def turnOn(): Unit = println("The light is on")
  def turnOff(): Unit = println("The light is off")
}

// ConcreteCommand classes
case class TurnOnCommand(light: Light) extends Command {
  override def execute(): Unit = light.turnOn()
}

case class TurnOffCommand(light: Light) extends Command {
  override def execute(): Unit = light.turnOff()
}

// Invoker class
class RemoteControl {
  private var command: Option[Command] = None

  def setCommand(command: Command): Unit = {
    this.command = Some(command)
  }

  def pressButton(): Unit = {
    command.foreach(_.execute())
  }
}

// Client code
object CommandPatternExample extends App {
  val light = new Light
  val turnOn = TurnOnCommand(light)
  val turnOff = TurnOffCommand(light)

  val remote = new RemoteControl
  remote.setCommand(turnOn)
  remote.pressButton()

  remote.setCommand(turnOff)
  remote.pressButton()
}
```

**Code Explanation**: In this example, we have a `Light` class as the receiver, which has methods to turn the light on and off. The `TurnOnCommand` and `TurnOffCommand` are concrete implementations of the `Command` trait. The `RemoteControl` acts as the invoker, which can execute any command it is given.

### Design Considerations

- **Immutability**: By using case classes, we ensure that our command objects are immutable, which is a key aspect of functional programming in Scala.
- **First-Class Functions**: Scala allows us to use functions as first-class citizens, which means we can pass them around as parameters, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables. This feature can be used to implement the Command Pattern without explicitly defining command classes.
- **Undo Functionality**: To support undo operations, commands can store the state of the receiver before executing the command, allowing them to revert the receiver to its previous state.

### Differences and Similarities

- **Command vs. Strategy Pattern**: Both patterns encapsulate behavior, but the Command Pattern is more focused on executing operations, while the Strategy Pattern is about selecting algorithms at runtime.
- **Command vs. Chain of Responsibility**: The Command Pattern encapsulates a request, whereas the Chain of Responsibility passes the request along a chain of handlers.

### Advanced Concepts

#### Commands as First-Class Functions

In Scala, we can leverage first-class functions to implement the Command Pattern in a more concise way. Here's how you can achieve this:

```scala
// Receiver class
class Light {
  def turnOn(): Unit = println("The light is on")
  def turnOff(): Unit = println("The light is off")
}

// Invoker class
class RemoteControl {
  private var command: Option[() => Unit] = None

  def setCommand(command: () => Unit): Unit = {
    this.command = Some(command)
  }

  def pressButton(): Unit = {
    command.foreach(_.apply())
  }
}

// Client code
object CommandPatternWithFunctions extends App {
  val light = new Light

  val turnOnCommand: () => Unit = () => light.turnOn()
  val turnOffCommand: () => Unit = () => light.turnOff()

  val remote = new RemoteControl
  remote.setCommand(turnOnCommand)
  remote.pressButton()

  remote.setCommand(turnOffCommand)
  remote.pressButton()
}
```

**Code Explanation**: In this version, we use functions to represent commands. The `RemoteControl` class stores a function that it can execute, demonstrating the flexibility of using first-class functions in Scala.

#### Implementing Undo Functionality

To implement undo functionality, we need to store the state of the receiver before executing a command. Here's an example:

```scala
// The Command interface with undo functionality
trait Command {
  def execute(): Unit
  def undo(): Unit
}

// Receiver class
class Light {
  private var isOn = false

  def turnOn(): Unit = {
    isOn = true
    println("The light is on")
  }

  def turnOff(): Unit = {
    isOn = false
    println("The light is off")
  }

  def getState: Boolean = isOn
}

// ConcreteCommand classes with undo
case class TurnOnCommand(light: Light) extends Command {
  private var prevState: Boolean = _

  override def execute(): Unit = {
    prevState = light.getState
    light.turnOn()
  }

  override def undo(): Unit = {
    if (!prevState) light.turnOff()
  }
}

case class TurnOffCommand(light: Light) extends Command {
  private var prevState: Boolean = _

  override def execute(): Unit = {
    prevState = light.getState
    light.turnOff()
  }

  override def undo(): Unit = {
    if (prevState) light.turnOn()
  }
}

// Client code
object CommandPatternWithUndo extends App {
  val light = new Light
  val turnOn = TurnOnCommand(light)
  val turnOff = TurnOffCommand(light)

  turnOn.execute()
  turnOn.undo()

  turnOff.execute()
  turnOff.undo()
}
```

**Code Explanation**: In this example, the `Command` interface includes an `undo` method. Each concrete command class stores the previous state of the `Light` before executing its action, allowing it to revert the state if needed.

### Visualizing Command Execution Flow

To better understand the flow of command execution, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    participant Command
    participant Receiver

    Client->>Invoker: setCommand(Command)
    Client->>Invoker: pressButton()
    Invoker->>Command: execute()
    Command->>Receiver: action()
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of command execution, showing how the `Client` sets a command in the `Invoker`, which then executes the command, resulting in an action performed by the `Receiver`.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Command Pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- Implement additional commands for the `Light`, such as dimming or changing colors.
- Experiment with using first-class functions to create more complex command sequences.
- Implement a command history in the `RemoteControl` to allow multiple undo operations.
