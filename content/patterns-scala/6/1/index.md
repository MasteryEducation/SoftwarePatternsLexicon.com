## 6.1 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, giving more flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects. In Scala, we can leverage functional programming features such as functions and pattern matching to implement this pattern effectively.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. This pattern allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it.

### Key Participants

1. **Handler**: Defines an interface for handling requests. Optionally, it implements the successor link.
2. **ConcreteHandler**: Handles requests it is responsible for. It can access its successor. If the ConcreteHandler can handle the request, it does so; otherwise, it forwards the request to its successor.
3. **Client**: Initiates the request to a ConcreteHandler object on the chain.

### Applicability

Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when:

- More than one object can handle a request, and the handler isn't known a priori. The handler should be ascertained automatically.
- You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
- The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.

### Diagram

Below is a diagram illustrating the Chain of Responsibility pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Handler {
        +handleRequest()
    }
    class ConcreteHandler1 {
        +handleRequest()
    }
    class ConcreteHandler2 {
        +handleRequest()
    }
    class Client {
        +makeRequest()
    }
    Handler <|-- ConcreteHandler1
    Handler <|-- ConcreteHandler2
    Client --> Handler
```

### Implementing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern in Scala

Scala's functional programming capabilities make it an excellent language for implementing the Chain of Responsibility pattern. We can use functions and pattern matching to create a chain of handlers that process requests.

#### Sample Code Snippet

Let's start with a simple example where we have a chain of handlers that process requests based on their type.

```scala
// Define a trait for the Handler
trait Handler {
  def handleRequest(request: String): Option[String]
}

// Implement Concrete Handlers
class ConcreteHandler1 extends Handler {
  override def handleRequest(request: String): Option[String] = {
    if (request.contains("Handler1")) Some("Handled by Handler1")
    else None
  }
}

class ConcreteHandler2 extends Handler {
  override def handleRequest(request: String): Option[String] = {
    if (request.contains("Handler2")) Some("Handled by Handler2")
    else None
  }
}

// Client code to process requests
object ChainOfResponsibilityExample {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val handlers = List(new ConcreteHandler1, new ConcreteHandler2)

    def processRequest(request: String, handlers: List[Handler]): String = {
      handlers.view.flatMap(_.handleRequest(request)).headOption.getOrElse("No handler could process the request")
    }

    println(processRequest("Request for Handler1", handlers))
    println(processRequest("Request for Handler2", handlers))
    println(processRequest("Request for Handler3", handlers))
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `Handler` trait with a `handleRequest` method. We then create two concrete handlers, `ConcreteHandler1` and `ConcreteHandler2`, each capable of handling specific requests. The `processRequest` function iterates over the list of handlers and processes the request using the first handler that can handle it.

### Design Considerations

- **Flexibility**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects. You can add or remove handlers dynamically.
- **Decoupling**: This pattern decouples the sender and receiver of a request, allowing for more modular code.
- **Performance**: Be cautious of performance issues if the chain becomes too long, as each request must pass through multiple handlers.

#### Scala-Specific Features

Scala's pattern matching and functional programming features can enhance the implementation of the Chain of Responsibility pattern. For instance, you can use pattern matching to determine which handler should process a request.

```scala
def handleRequest(request: String): String = request match {
  case r if r.contains("Handler1") => "Handled by Handler1"
  case r if r.contains("Handler2") => "Handled by Handler2"
  case _ => "No handler could process the request"
}
```

### Differences and Similarities

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is often compared to the Command pattern. While both involve processing requests, the Chain of Responsibility pattern allows multiple handlers to process a request, whereas the Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Chain of Responsibility pattern, try modifying the code example above to include additional handlers. Experiment with different request types and see how the chain processes them. You can also implement a logging mechanism to track which handlers are invoked for each request.

### Visualizing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

To better understand how the Chain of Responsibility pattern works, let's visualize the process of passing a request along a chain of handlers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Handler1
    participant Handler2
    participant Handler3

    Client->>Handler1: Request
    alt Handler1 can handle
        Handler1-->>Client: Response
    else Handler1 cannot handle
        Handler1->>Handler2: Forward Request
        alt Handler2 can handle
            Handler2-->>Client: Response
        else Handler2 cannot handle
            Handler2->>Handler3: Forward Request
            Handler3-->>Client: Response
        end
    end
```

In this sequence diagram, the client sends a request to `Handler1`. If `Handler1` can handle the request, it responds to the client. If not, it forwards the request to `Handler2`, and so on, until a handler processes the request or the chain ends.
