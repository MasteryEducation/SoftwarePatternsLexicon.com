## 6.4 Iterator Pattern

The Iterator Pattern is a fundamental behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. In Scala, this pattern is seamlessly integrated into the language through its rich collections API, allowing developers to traverse collections in a consistent and efficient manner.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Iterator Pattern is to provide a standard way to traverse a collection of elements, regardless of its specific type or structure. This pattern decouples the traversal logic from the collection itself, enabling flexibility and reusability of code.

### Key Participants

1. **Iterator**: An interface that defines methods for accessing and traversing elements.
2. **Concrete Iterator**: Implements the Iterator interface and maintains the current position in the traversal.
3. **Aggregate**: An interface that defines a method to create an iterator.
4. **Concrete Aggregate**: Implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the Concrete Iterator.

### Applicability

The Iterator Pattern is applicable when:

- You need to access the elements of a collection without exposing its internal structure.
- You want to provide multiple traversal methods over a collection.
- You need a uniform interface for traversing different types of collections.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore how to implement the Iterator Pattern in Scala using the collections API.

```scala
// Define a simple collection
class BookCollection(val books: List[String]) {
  // Create an iterator for the collection
  def iterator: Iterator[String] = new BookIterator(books)
}

// Concrete Iterator implementation
class BookIterator(books: List[String]) extends Iterator[String] {
  private var currentIndex = 0

  // Check if there are more elements
  override def hasNext: Boolean = currentIndex < books.length

  // Return the next element
  override def next(): String = {
    if (!hasNext) throw new NoSuchElementException("No more books")
    val book = books(currentIndex)
    currentIndex += 1
    book
  }
}

// Usage
val myBooks = new BookCollection(List("Scala Programming", "Design Patterns", "Functional Programming"))
val bookIterator = myBooks.iterator

while (bookIterator.hasNext) {
  println(bookIterator.next())
}
```

### Design Considerations

- **Efficiency**: Iterators should be designed to be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Avoid unnecessary computations or state storage.
- **Concurrency**: Consider thread safety if the collection is accessed concurrently. Scala's collections API provides thread-safe options like `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- **Scala-Specific Features**: Scala's collections API provides built-in iterators, making it easy to implement the Iterator Pattern without manually defining iterator classes.

### Differences and Similarities

The Iterator Pattern is often compared to the **Visitor Pattern**, as both involve traversing elements. However, the Iterator Pattern focuses on sequential access, while the Visitor Pattern is more about applying operations to elements.

### Using Scala's Collections API

Scala's collections API provides a rich set of methods to work with iterators. Let's explore some of these methods:

#### Creating Iterators

Scala collections like `List`, `Set`, and `Map` provide built-in methods to create iterators.

```scala
val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val iterator = numbers.iterator

while (iterator.hasNext) {
  println(iterator.next())
}
```

#### Transforming Collections

Scala's collections API allows you to transform collections using methods like `map`, `filter`, and `flatMap`, which internally use iterators.

```scala
val doubledNumbers = numbers.map(_ * 2)
doubledNumbers.foreach(println)
```

#### Custom Iterators

You can create custom iterators by extending the `Iterator` trait and implementing the `hasNext` and `next` methods.

```scala
class EvenNumberIterator(numbers: List[Int]) extends Iterator[Int] {
  private val evenNumbers = numbers.filter(_ % 2 == 0)
  private var currentIndex = 0

  override def hasNext: Boolean = currentIndex < evenNumbers.length

  override def next(): Int = {
    if (!hasNext) throw new NoSuchElementException("No more even numbers")
    val number = evenNumbers(currentIndex)
    currentIndex += 1
    number
  }
}

// Usage
val evenIterator = new EvenNumberIterator(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
while (evenIterator.hasNext) {
  println(evenIterator.next())
}
```

### Visualizing the Iterator Pattern

To better understand the Iterator Pattern, let's visualize the relationship between the key participants using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Iterator {
        <<interface>>
        +hasNext(): Boolean
        +next(): T
    }

    class ConcreteIterator {
        -currentIndex: Int
        +hasNext(): Boolean
        +next(): T
    }

    class Aggregate {
        <<interface>>
        +iterator(): Iterator
    }

    class ConcreteAggregate {
        +iterator(): Iterator
    }

    Iterator <|-- ConcreteIterator
    Aggregate <|-- ConcreteAggregate
    ConcreteAggregate o-- ConcreteIterator
```

### What is the primary purpose of the Iterator Pattern?

- [x] To provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
