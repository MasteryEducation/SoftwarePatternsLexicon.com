## 6.10 Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a series of steps that are common across multiple implementations but require some customization. In Scala, the Template Method Pattern can be elegantly implemented using abstract classes and method overriding.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Template Method Pattern is to define the overall structure of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to refine certain steps. This separation of concerns promotes code reuse and flexibility, enabling developers to implement variations of an algorithm without duplicating code.

### Key Participants

1. **Abstract Class**: Defines the template method and declares abstract methods for the steps that can vary.
2. **Concrete Subclasses**: Implement the abstract methods to provide specific behavior for each step of the algorithm.

### Applicability

- Use the Template Method Pattern when you have multiple classes that share a common algorithm but differ in specific steps.
- Apply this pattern to promote code reuse and reduce redundancy by encapsulating common behavior in a superclass.
- Consider the Template Method Pattern when you want to enforce a specific sequence of steps in an algorithm.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a practical example of the Template Method Pattern in Scala. We'll implement a simple data processing pipeline where the steps of data loading, processing, and saving are defined in a template method.

```scala
// Abstract class defining the template method
abstract class DataProcessor {

  // Template method defining the skeleton of the algorithm
  final def process(): Unit = {
    loadData()
    processData()
    saveData()
  }

  // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
  def loadData(): Unit
  def processData(): Unit
  def saveData(): Unit
}

// Concrete subclass implementing specific steps
class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
  override def loadData(): Unit = {
    println("Loading data from CSV file...")
    // Implementation for loading CSV data
  }

  override def processData(): Unit = {
    println("Processing CSV data...")
    // Implementation for processing CSV data
  }

  override def saveData(): Unit = {
    println("Saving processed data to CSV file...")
    // Implementation for saving data
  }
}

// Concrete subclass implementing specific steps
class JSONDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
  override def loadData(): Unit = {
    println("Loading data from JSON file...")
    // Implementation for loading JSON data
  }

  override def processData(): Unit = {
    println("Processing JSON data...")
    // Implementation for processing JSON data
  }

  override def saveData(): Unit = {
    println("Saving processed data to JSON file...")
    // Implementation for saving data
  }
}

// Usage
object TemplateMethodExample extends App {
  val csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor()
  csvProcessor.process()

  val jsonProcessor = new JSONDataProcessor()
  jsonProcessor.process()
}
```

In this example, the `DataProcessor` abstract class defines the `process` method, which serves as the template method. The `CSVDataProcessor` and `JSONDataProcessor` classes extend `DataProcessor` and provide specific implementations for the `loadData`, `processData`, and `saveData` methods.

### Design Considerations

- **Final Template Method**: Mark the template method as `final` to prevent subclasses from altering the algorithm's structure.
- **Hook Methods**: Consider adding hook methods in the abstract class to provide optional steps that subclasses can override if needed.
- **Code Reuse**: By encapsulating common behavior in the abstract class, the Template Method Pattern promotes code reuse and reduces duplication.

### Differences and Similarities

The Template Method Pattern is often confused with the Strategy Pattern. While both patterns involve defining a family of algorithms, the Template Method Pattern focuses on defining the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, whereas the Strategy Pattern involves encapsulating algorithms in separate classes.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

To better understand the Template Method Pattern, let's visualize the relationship between the abstract class and its subclasses using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DataProcessor {
        <<abstract>>
        +process() : Unit
        +loadData() : Unit
        +processData() : Unit
        +saveData() : Unit
    }
    class CSVDataProcessor {
        +loadData() : Unit
        +processData() : Unit
        +saveData() : Unit
    }
    class JSONDataProcessor {
        +loadData() : Unit
        +processData() : Unit
        +saveData() : Unit
    }
    DataProcessor <|-- CSVDataProcessor
    DataProcessor <|-- JSONDataProcessor
```

This diagram illustrates how the `DataProcessor` class serves as the template for its subclasses, which implement the specific steps of the algorithm.

### Try It Yourself

To gain a deeper understanding of the Template Method Pattern, try modifying the code example above. Here are a few suggestions:

- Add a new subclass, `XMLDataProcessor`, that processes XML data.
- Introduce a hook method in the `DataProcessor` class to allow subclasses to perform additional actions before saving data.
- Experiment with different data processing algorithms by overriding the `processData` method in the subclasses.
