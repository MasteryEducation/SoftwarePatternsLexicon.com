### Visualizing Scala Design Patterns

To aid your understanding of Scala design patterns, consider creating diagrams to visualize the relationships and interactions between components. Here are some examples:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        +getInstance(): Singleton
    }
    class Client {
        +useSingleton()
    }
    Singleton <|-- Client
```

*Diagram 1: Singleton Pattern in Scala - This diagram illustrates the Singleton pattern, where a single instance of a class is accessed by a client.*

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Factory
    participant Product
    Client->>Factory: createProduct()
    Factory->>Product: new Product()
    Factory-->>Client: return Product
```

*Diagram 2: Factory Pattern Sequence - This sequence diagram shows the interaction between a client, a factory, and a product in the Factory pattern.*
