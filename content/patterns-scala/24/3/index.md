## 24.3 Pattern Reference Cheat Sheet

This section provides a quick-reference guide to the design patterns discussed in the Scala Design Patterns guide. Each pattern is presented with a consistent format to facilitate understanding and application in your projects.

### Singleton Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        - Singleton instance
        + getInstance(): Singleton
    }
```

- **Key Participants**: Singleton class
- **Applicability**: Use when exactly one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
object Singleton {
  private var instance: Singleton = _

  def getInstance: Singleton = {
    if (instance == null) {
      instance = new Singleton()
    }
    instance
  }
}

class Singleton private() {
  // Singleton logic
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Ensure thread safety in concurrent environments. Scala's `object` keyword inherently provides a thread-safe singleton.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Often confused with the Factory pattern, which deals with object creation but not uniqueness.

### Factory Method Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Creator {
        <<abstract>>
        + factoryMethod(): Product
    }
    class ConcreteCreator {
        + factoryMethod(): ConcreteProduct
    }
    class Product
    class ConcreteProduct
    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Product <|-- ConcreteProduct
    Creator --> Product : creates
```

- **Key Participants**: Creator, ConcreteCreator, Product
- **Applicability**: Use when a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
trait Product {
  def use(): Unit
}

class ConcreteProductA extends Product {
  override def use(): Unit = println("Using Product A")
}

class ConcreteProductB extends Product {
  override def use(): Unit = println("Using Product B")
}

abstract class Creator {
  def factoryMethod(): Product
}

class ConcreteCreatorA extends Creator {
  override def factoryMethod(): Product = new ConcreteProductA
}

class ConcreteCreatorB extends Creator {
  override def factoryMethod(): Product = new ConcreteProductB
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Consider using pattern matching in Scala to simplify factory logic.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Different from the Abstract Factory pattern, which provides an interface for creating families of related objects.

### Builder Pattern

- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Builder {
        <<interface>>
        + buildPart(): void
    }
    class ConcreteBuilder {
        + buildPart(): void
        + getResult(): Product
    }
    class Director {
        + construct(): void
    }
    class Product
    Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder
    Director --> Builder : uses
    ConcreteBuilder --> Product : creates
```

- **Key Participants**: Builder, ConcreteBuilder, Director, Product
- **Applicability**: Use when the construction process must allow different representations of an object.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
case class Car(engine: String, wheels: Int, color: String)

class CarBuilder {
  private var engine: String = _
  private var wheels: Int = _
  private var color: String = _

  def setEngine(engine: String): CarBuilder = {
    this.engine = engine
    this
  }

  def setWheels(wheels: Int): CarBuilder = {
    this.wheels = wheels
    this
  }

  def setColor(color: String): CarBuilder = {
    this.color = color
    this
  }

  def build(): Car = Car(engine, wheels, color)
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Use Scala's case classes and copy methods for immutable builders.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Similar to the Factory pattern, but focuses on constructing complex objects step by step.

### Adapter Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        + request(): void
    }
    class Adapter {
        + request(): void
    }
    class Adaptee {
        + specificRequest(): void
    }
    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter --> Adaptee : calls
```

- **Key Participants**: Target, Adapter, Adaptee
- **Applicability**: Use when you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
trait Target {
  def request(): String
}

class Adaptee {
  def specificRequest(): String = "Adaptee's specific request"
}

class Adapter(adaptee: Adaptee) extends Target {
  override def request(): String = adaptee.specificRequest()
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Use implicit conversions in Scala to create adapters seamlessly.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Often confused with the Decorator pattern, which adds behavior rather than adapting interfaces.

### Decorator Pattern

- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        + operation(): void
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        + operation(): void
    }
    class Decorator {
        + operation(): void
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorA {
        + operation(): void
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorB {
        + operation(): void
    }
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorA
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorB
    Decorator --> Component : wraps
```

- **Key Participants**: Component, ConcreteComponent, Decorator, ConcreteDecorator
- **Applicability**: Use to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
trait Coffee {
  def cost(): Double
  def description(): String
}

class SimpleCoffee extends Coffee {
  override def cost(): Double = 5.0
  override def description(): String = "Simple coffee"
}

abstract class CoffeeDecorator(coffee: Coffee) extends Coffee {
  override def cost(): Double = coffee.cost()
  override def description(): String = coffee.description()
}

class MilkDecorator(coffee: Coffee) extends CoffeeDecorator(coffee) {
  override def cost(): Double = super.cost() + 1.5
  override def description(): String = super.description() + ", milk"
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Use Scala's traits and mixins to implement decorators.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Different from the Adapter pattern, which changes interfaces rather than adding functionality.

### Observer Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        + attach(Observer): void
        + detach(Observer): void
        + notify(): void
    }
    class ConcreteSubject {
        + getState(): int
        + setState(int): void
    }
    class Observer {
        + update(): void
    }
    class ConcreteObserver {
        + update(): void
    }
    Subject <|-- ConcreteSubject
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver
    Subject --> Observer : notifies
```

- **Key Participants**: Subject, ConcreteSubject, Observer, ConcreteObserver
- **Applicability**: Use when an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
trait Observer {
  def update(subject: Subject): Unit
}

class ConcreteObserver extends Observer {
  override def update(subject: Subject): Unit = {
    println(s"Observer notified. New state: ${subject.getState}")
  }
}

trait Subject {
  private var observers: List[Observer] = List()

  def attach(observer: Observer): Unit = observers ::= observer
  def detach(observer: Observer): Unit = observers = observers.filterNot(_ == observer)
  def notifyObservers(): Unit = observers.foreach(_.update(this))
  def getState: Int
}

class ConcreteSubject extends Subject {
  private var state: Int = _

  def setState(state: Int): Unit = {
    this.state = state
    notifyObservers()
  }

  override def getState: Int = state
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Use Scala's `Observable` trait for reactive programming.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Similar to the Mediator pattern, but the Observer pattern allows for direct communication between subjects and observers.

### Strategy Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        + setStrategy(Strategy): void
        + executeStrategy(): void
    }
    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        + algorithmInterface(): void
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        + algorithmInterface(): void
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        + algorithmInterface(): void
    }
    Context --> Strategy : uses
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
```

- **Key Participants**: Context, Strategy, ConcreteStrategy
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to use one of several algorithms dynamically.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
trait Strategy {
  def execute(a: Int, b: Int): Int
}

class AddStrategy extends Strategy {
  override def execute(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
}

class MultiplyStrategy extends Strategy {
  override def execute(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a * b
}

class Context(var strategy: Strategy) {
  def executeStrategy(a: Int, b: Int): Int = strategy.execute(a, b)
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Use higher-order functions in Scala to pass strategies as parameters.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Different from the State pattern, which changes behavior based on state rather than strategy.

### Command Pattern

- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        <<interface>>
        + execute(): void
    }
    class ConcreteCommand {
        + execute(): void
    }
    class Invoker {
        + setCommand(Command): void
        + executeCommand(): void
    }
    class Receiver {
        + action(): void
    }
    Command <|-- ConcreteCommand
    Invoker --> Command : uses
    ConcreteCommand --> Receiver : calls
```

- **Key Participants**: Command, ConcreteCommand, Invoker, Receiver
- **Applicability**: Use to parameterize objects with operations, delay execution, or queue operations.
- **Sample Code Snippet**:

```scala
trait Command {
  def execute(): Unit
}

class LightOnCommand(light: Light) extends Command {
  override def execute(): Unit = light.on()
}

class Light {
  def on(): Unit = println("Light is on")
  def off(): Unit = println("Light is off")
}

class RemoteControl {
  private var command: Command = _

  def setCommand(command: Command): Unit = this.command = command
  def pressButton(): Unit = command.execute()
}
```

- **Design Considerations**: Use Scala's functions as commands for simplicity.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Similar to the Strategy pattern, but focuses on executing commands rather than selecting algorithms.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code snippets by modifying them to suit different scenarios. For example, try creating a new `ConcreteProductC` in the Factory Method pattern or add a `SugarDecorator` in the Decorator pattern. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of each pattern's flexibility and applicability.
