## 24.1 Glossary of Terms

Welcome to the comprehensive glossary of terms for the "Scala Design Patterns For Expert Software Engineers and Architects" guide. This glossary is designed to provide clear and concise definitions of key terminology used throughout the guide, helping you deepen your understanding of Scala's unique features and paradigms. Whether you're an expert software engineer or an architect, this glossary will serve as a valuable reference as you navigate the complexities of design patterns in Scala.

### A

**Abstract Factory Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is particularly useful when a system must be independent of how its objects are created.

A concurrency model that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation. In Scala, the Akka framework is commonly used to implement the actor model, allowing for scalable and resilient systems.

**Algebraic Data Type (ADT)**  
A composite type used in functional programming, composed of product types (tuples) and sum types (disjoint unions). ADTs are often represented using Scala's case classes and sealed traits.

**Applicative Functor**  
A type class that allows for function application lifted over a computational context. Applicatives are more general than monads and are used in scenarios where monadic chaining is not required.

### B

**Backpressure**  
A mechanism for controlling the flow of data between producers and consumers, ensuring that a fast producer does not overwhelm a slow consumer. In Scala, backpressure is often managed using reactive streams.

**Behavioral Design Pattern**  
A category of design patterns that focus on communication between objects and the delegation of responsibilities. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

**Bounded Context**  
A concept from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) that defines the boundaries within which a particular model is applicable. It helps in managing complexity by dividing a large system into smaller, more manageable parts.

### C

**Cake Pattern**  
A Scala-specific pattern for dependency injection that uses traits and self-types to achieve modularity and composability. It allows for flexible and testable code without relying on external DI frameworks.

**Case Class**  
A special type of class in Scala that is immutable by default and provides pattern matching capabilities. Case classes are often used to model data and are a key feature of Scala's functional programming paradigm.

**Category Theory**  
A branch of mathematics that deals with abstract structures and relationships between them. In programming, category theory provides a foundation for understanding concepts like functors, monads, and applicatives.

**Chain of Responsibility Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

**Command Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It decouples the sender of a request from its receiver.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
A pattern that separates the read and write operations of a data store, allowing for optimized handling of each. CQRS is often used in conjunction with event sourcing.

**Currying**  
A functional programming technique in which a function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. Currying allows for partial application of functions.

### D

**Decorator Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

**Dependency Injection (DI)**  
A design pattern that allows for the decoupling of object creation from object usage. DI can be implemented using various techniques, including constructor injection, setter injection, and interface injection.

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
An approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a model that accurately reflects the business domain.

**DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**  
A programming language or specification language dedicated to a particular problem domain. DSLs are designed to express solutions in a way that is natural to the domain experts.
