## 22.2 Building a Compiler Front-End

In this section, we delve into the fascinating world of compiler construction, focusing on the front-end components: parsing and interpreting languages. Building a compiler front-end involves transforming source code into an intermediate representation, which is crucial for further processing by the compiler back-end. This guide will walk you through the essential concepts, techniques, and tools needed to create a robust compiler front-end using Scala.

### Introduction to Compiler Front-End

The compiler front-end is responsible for reading source code, checking it for correctness, and converting it into a form that can be easily manipulated by the back-end. The front-end typically consists of three main stages: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis.

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Also known as scanning, this stage involves breaking the source code into tokens, the smallest units of meaning, such as keywords, operators, and identifiers.

2. **Syntax Analysis**: Also known as parsing, this stage involves analyzing the sequence of tokens to determine its grammatical structure according to the language's syntax rules.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: This stage involves verifying the semantic correctness of the parsed code, ensuring that it adheres to the language's rules and constraints.

### Lexical Analysis

Lexical analysis is the first step in the compiler front-end process. It involves reading the source code and converting it into a stream of tokens. Tokens are categorized into different types, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

#### Implementing a Lexer in Scala

To implement a lexer in Scala, we can use regular expressions to match patterns in the source code. Here's a simple example of a lexer for a hypothetical language:

```scala
object Lexer {
  sealed trait Token
  case class Keyword(value: String) extends Token
  case class Identifier(value: String) extends Token
  case class Number(value: Int) extends Token
  case class Operator(value: String) extends Token
  case object EndOfFile extends Token

  def tokenize(input: String): List[Token] = {
    val tokenPatterns = List(
      "if" -> Keyword("if"),
      "else" -> Keyword("else"),
      "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*" -> ((s: String) => Identifier(s)),
      "[0-9]+" -> ((s: String) => Number(s.toInt)),
      "[+\\-*/]" -> ((s: String) => Operator(s))
    )

    def matchToken(input: String): Option[(Token, String)] = {
      tokenPatterns.collectFirst {
        case (pattern, constructor) if input.matches(s"^$pattern.*") =>
          val matched = input.takeWhile(_.toString.matches(pattern))
          (constructor(matched), input.drop(matched.length))
      }
    }

    def tokenizeRec(input: String, tokens: List[Token]): List[Token] = {
      if (input.isEmpty) tokens :+ EndOfFile
      else matchToken(input) match {
        case Some((token, rest)) => tokenizeRec(rest.trim, tokens :+ token)
        case None => throw new IllegalArgumentException(s"Unexpected input: $input")
      }
    }

    tokenizeRec(input.trim, List.empty)
  }
}

// Example usage
val sourceCode = "if x + 10 else"
val tokens = Lexer.tokenize(sourceCode)
println(tokens)
```

### Syntax Analysis

Syntax analysis, or parsing, involves constructing a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) from the sequence of tokens generated by the lexer. The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the source code.

#### Implementing a Parser in Scala

To implement a parser, we can use recursive descent parsing, a top-down approach where each non-terminal in the grammar is represented by a function. Here's an example of a simple parser for arithmetic expressions:

```scala
sealed trait Expr
case class Number(value: Int) extends Expr
case class Add(left: Expr, right: Expr) extends Expr
case class Subtract(left: Expr, right: Expr) extends Expr

object Parser {
  def parse(tokens: List[Lexer.Token]): Expr = {
    def parseExpression(tokens: List[Lexer.Token]): (Expr, List[Lexer.Token]) = {
      val (term, rest) = parseTerm(tokens)
      rest match {
        case Lexer.Operator("+") :: tail =>
          val (nextTerm, finalRest) = parseExpression(tail)
          (Add(term, nextTerm), finalRest)
        case Lexer.Operator("-") :: tail =>
          val (nextTerm, finalRest) = parseExpression(tail)
          (Subtract(term, nextTerm), finalRest)
        case _ => (term, rest)
      }
    }

    def parseTerm(tokens: List[Lexer.Token]): (Expr, List[Lexer.Token]) = {
      tokens match {
        case Lexer.Number(value) :: tail => (Number(value), tail)
        case _ => throw new IllegalArgumentException("Expected a number")
      }
    }

    val (expr, remainingTokens) = parseExpression(tokens)
    if (remainingTokens != List(Lexer.EndOfFile)) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unexpected tokens at end of input")
    }
    expr
  }
}

// Example usage
val tokens = Lexer.tokenize("10 + 20 - 5")
val ast = Parser.parse(tokens)
println(ast)
```

### Semantic Analysis

Semantic analysis involves checking the AST for semantic errors, such as type mismatches or undeclared variables. This stage ensures that the program is meaningful and adheres to the language's rules.

#### Implementing Semantic Analysis in Scala

In our example, we can perform semantic analysis by traversing the AST and checking for errors. Here's a simple implementation:

```scala
object SemanticAnalyzer {
  def analyze(expr: Expr): Unit = {
    def checkExpr(expr: Expr): Unit = expr match {
      case Number(_) => // Numbers are always valid
      case Add(left, right) =>
        checkExpr(left)
        checkExpr(right)
      case Subtract(left, right) =>
        checkExpr(left)
        checkExpr(right)
    }

    checkExpr(expr)
  }
}

// Example usage
SemanticAnalyzer.analyze(ast)
```

### Visualizing the Compiler Front-End Process

To better understand the compiler front-end process, let's visualize the flow from source code to tokens, AST, and semantic analysis using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Source Code] --> B[Lexical Analysis]
    B --> C[Tokens]
    C --> D[Syntax Analysis]
    D --> E[Abstract Syntax Tree]
    E --> F[Semantic Analysis]
    F --> G[Checked AST]
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of building a compiler front-end, let's encourage you to experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the lexer to recognize additional tokens, such as new keywords or operators. Extend the parser to handle more complex expressions, such as multiplication and division. Implement additional semantic checks, such as ensuring variables are declared before use.

### Advanced Topics in Compiler Front-End Design

As you become more comfortable with the basics, consider exploring advanced topics in compiler front-end design:

1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to provide meaningful error messages and recover from errors gracefully.

2. **Optimization**: Explore techniques for optimizing the AST, such as constant folding and dead code elimination.

3. **Intermediate Representation**: Learn about different intermediate representations, such as three-address code or SSA form, and how they can be used to facilitate optimization and code generation.

4. **Tooling**: Familiarize yourself with tools and libraries that can aid in compiler construction, such as ANTLR for parser generation or LLVM for code generation.
