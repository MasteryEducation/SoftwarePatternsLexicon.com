## 28.6 Implementing Domain-Driven Design with JavaScript Classes and Modules

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a powerful approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a model that accurately reflects the business domain. In this section, we will explore how to implement DDD using JavaScript's ES6 classes and modules, creating a modular and maintainable codebase.

### Understanding Domain-Driven Design

Before diving into implementation, let's briefly revisit the core concepts of DDD:

- **Domain**: The sphere of knowledge and activity around which the application logic revolves.
- **Entities**: Objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states.
- **Value Objects**: Objects that describe some characteristic or attribute but have no conceptual identity.
- **Aggregates**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
- **Repositories**: Mechanisms for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects.
- **Services**: Operations that do not naturally fit within entities or value objects.

### JavaScript ES6 Classes for Domain Entities and Value Objects

JavaScript ES6 introduced classes, providing a more structured way to define objects and their behaviors. Let's see how we can use classes to represent domain entities and value objects.

#### Defining Domain Entities

Entities are the core of your domain model. They have a unique identity and lifecycle. Here's how you can define an entity using JavaScript classes:

```javascript
// Entity: User
class User {
  constructor(id, name, email) {
    this.id = id; // Unique identifier
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  updateEmail(newEmail) {
    this.email = newEmail;
  }

  equals(otherUser) {
    return otherUser instanceof User && this.id === otherUser.id;
  }
}

// Usage
const user1 = new User(1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
const user2 = new User(2, 'Bob', 'bob@example.com');
console.log(user1.equals(user2)); // false
```

#### Creating Value Objects

Value objects are immutable and do not have an identity. They are defined by their attributes. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Value Object: Address
class Address {
  constructor(street, city, zipCode) {
    this.street = street;
    this.city = city;
    this.zipCode = zipCode;
    Object.freeze(this); // Make the object immutable
  }

  equals(otherAddress) {
    return (
      otherAddress instanceof Address &&
      this.street === otherAddress.street &&
      this.city === otherAddress.city &&
      this.zipCode === otherAddress.zipCode
    );
  }
}

// Usage
const address1 = new Address('123 Main St', 'Anytown', '12345');
const address2 = new Address('123 Main St', 'Anytown', '12345');
console.log(address1.equals(address2)); // true
```

### Organizing Code with Modules

Modules in JavaScript allow you to encapsulate code and create reusable components. This is crucial in DDD as it helps maintain boundaries between different parts of the domain.

#### Using Import/Export Statements

JavaScript modules use `import` and `export` statements to share functionality between files. Here's how you can structure your domain model using modules:

```javascript
// user.js
export class User {
  constructor(id, name, email) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  updateEmail(newEmail) {
    this.email = newEmail;
  }
}

// address.js
export class Address {
  constructor(street, city, zipCode) {
    this.street = street;
    this.city = city;
    this.zipCode = zipCode;
    Object.freeze(this);
  }
}

// main.js
import { User } from './user.js';
import { Address } from './address.js';

const user = new User(1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
const address = new Address('123 Main St', 'Anytown', '12345');
```

### Enforcing Boundaries with Modules

Modules help enforce boundaries within your domain by encapsulating logic and exposing only what is necessary. This aligns with the DDD principle of maintaining clear boundaries between different parts of the domain.

#### Example: Encapsulating Domain Logic

Consider a scenario where you have a `UserService` that handles user-related operations. You can encapsulate this logic within a module:

```javascript
// userService.js
import { User } from './user.js';

export class UserService {
  constructor(userRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
  }

  registerUser(name, email) {
    const user = new User(Date.now(), name, email);
    this.userRepository.save(user);
    return user;
  }

  changeUserEmail(userId, newEmail) {
    const user = this.userRepository.findById(userId);
    if (user) {
      user.updateEmail(newEmail);
      this.userRepository.save(user);
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Namespaces and Folder Structures

Organizing your codebase using namespaces or folder structures can help reflect the domain context and maintain clarity.

#### Example Folder Structure

```
src/
  domain/
    user/
      User.js
      UserService.js
      UserRepository.js
    order/
      Order.js
      OrderService.js
      OrderRepository.js
  infrastructure/
    database/
      DatabaseConnection.js
    messaging/
      MessageQueue.js
```

This structure separates domain logic from infrastructure concerns, making it easier to manage and scale the application.

### Visualizing Domain-Driven Design with JavaScript

To better understand how these components interact, let's visualize the relationships between entities, value objects, services, and repositories using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class User {
    +String id
    +String name
    +String email
    +updateEmail(newEmail)
    +equals(otherUser)
  }

  class Address {
    +String street
    +String city
    +String zipCode
    +equals(otherAddress)
  }

  class UserService {
    +UserRepository userRepository
    +registerUser(name, email)
    +changeUserEmail(userId, newEmail)
  }

  class UserRepository {
    +save(user)
    +findById(userId)
  }

  UserService --> UserRepository
  User --> Address
```
