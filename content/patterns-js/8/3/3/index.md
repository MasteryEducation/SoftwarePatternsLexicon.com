## 8.3.3 Custom Directives in Vue.js

### Introduction

In Vue.js, custom directives offer a powerful way to extend HTML elements with custom behavior, especially when built-in directives fall short. They allow developers to directly manipulate the DOM, providing flexibility and control over the user interface. This article delves into the concept of custom directives, their implementation, and practical use cases, ensuring you can leverage them effectively in your Vue.js applications.

### Understanding the Concept

Custom directives in Vue.js are used to encapsulate DOM manipulation logic. They are particularly useful when you need to perform low-level operations that Vue's built-in directives don't cover. By defining custom directives, you can create reusable pieces of functionality that enhance your components' behavior.

### Implementation Steps

#### Define a Custom Directive

Custom directives can be defined globally or locally within a component.

- **Globally (Vue 2):** Use `Vue.directive('directive-name', options)` to register a global directive.
- **Locally in a Component:** Add a `directives` property in the component definition and define the directive within this property.

#### Directive Lifecycle Hooks

Vue.js provides several lifecycle hooks for directives, allowing you to hook into different stages of a directive's lifecycle:

- **bind:** Called once when the directive is first bound to the element.
- **inserted:** Called when the bound element is inserted into the parent node.
- **update:** Called when the component's VNode updates.
- **componentUpdated:** Called after the component and its children have updated.
- **unbind:** Called once when the directive is unbound from the element.

#### Apply the Directive

To use a custom directive in templates, apply it with the `v-your-directive` syntax. You can also pass values or arguments as needed.

### Code Examples

#### Global Directive Example (Vue 2)

```javascript
// Register globally
Vue.directive('focus', {
  inserted: function (el) {
    el.focus();
  }
});
```

**Usage in Template:**

```html
<input v-focus />
```

#### Local Directive Example

```javascript
// Component definition
export default {
  directives: {
    'highlight': {
      bind(el, binding) {
        el.style.backgroundColor = binding.value;
      }
    }
  }
};
```

**Usage in Template:**

```html
<p v-highlight="'yellow'">Highlighted Text</p>
```

### Use Cases

Custom directives are versatile and can be used in various scenarios:

- **Focus an Input Field:** Auto-focus an input when the component is mounted using a `v-focus` directive.
- **Tooltip Implementation:** Show custom tooltips on hover with a `v-tooltip` directive.
- **Drag and Drop:** Enable drag-and-drop functionality using directives to handle DOM events.
- **Third-Party Libraries Integration:** Integrate jQuery plugins or other libraries that require direct DOM manipulation.

### Practice

#### Create a Custom Tooltip Directive

**Directive Definition:**

```javascript
Vue.directive('tooltip', {
  bind(el, binding) {
    el.setAttribute('title', binding.value);
  }
});
```

**Usage:**

```html
<button v-tooltip="'Click to submit'">Submit</button>
```

#### Implement an Uppercase Input Directive

**Directive Definition:**

```javascript
Vue.directive('uppercase', {
  update(el) {
    el.value = el.value.toUpperCase();
  }
});
```

**Usage:**

```html
<input v-model="text" v-uppercase />
```

### Considerations

- **Directive Naming:** Use kebab-case for directive names (e.g., `v-my-directive`).
- **Reactivity:** Update the directive when reactive data changes using appropriate lifecycle hooks.
- **Performance:** Be cautious with intensive DOM manipulation to avoid performance issues.
- **Code Reusability:** Keep directives general-purpose for reuse across components.

### Tips

- **Accessing Binding Information:** Use `binding.value`, `binding.arg`, and `binding.modifiers` within directive hooks.
- **Directive Arguments and Modifiers:** Apply arguments (e.g., `v-your-directive:argument`) and modifiers (e.g., `v-your-directive.modifier`) for flexibility.
- **Cleanup:** Implement the `unbind` hook to remove event listeners or clean up when the directive is unbound.
- **Directive in Vue 3:** In Vue 3, use the `beforeMount`, `mounted`, `beforeUpdate`, `updated`, `beforeUnmount`, and `unmounted` hooks in the directive object.

### Advanced Usage

- **Passing Multiple Parameters:** Pass an object to the directive using `v-directive="{ prop1: value1, prop2: value2 }"`. Access properties via `binding.value.prop1`.
- **Dynamic Arguments:** Use dynamic arguments with square brackets, e.g., `v-my-directive:[argument]="value"`.
- **Integrating with Vue's Reactivity:** Ensure the directive works seamlessly with Vue's reactivity system, updating the DOM when data changes.

### Conclusion

Custom directives in Vue.js are a powerful tool for extending HTML elements with custom behavior. By understanding their lifecycle hooks, implementation methods, and practical applications, you can enhance your Vue.js applications with reusable and efficient DOM manipulation logic. Whether you're integrating third-party libraries or creating custom UI interactions, custom directives provide the flexibility and control needed to build sophisticated web applications.

## Quiz Time!

### What is the primary purpose of custom directives in Vue.js?

- [x] To extend HTML elements with custom behavior
- [ ] To replace Vue components
- [ ] To handle Vuex state management
- [ ] To define routes in Vue Router

> **Explanation:** Custom directives in Vue.js are used to extend HTML elements with custom behavior, allowing for direct DOM manipulation when built-in directives are insufficient.

### Which lifecycle hook is called when the directive is first bound to the element?

- [x] bind
- [ ] inserted
- [ ] update
- [ ] unbind

> **Explanation:** The `bind` hook is called once when the directive is first bound to the element, allowing initial setup.

### How do you register a global directive in Vue 2?

- [x] Vue.directive('directive-name', options)
- [ ] Vue.component('component-name', options)
- [ ] Vue.mixin('mixin-name', options)
- [ ] Vue.filter('filter-name', options)

> **Explanation:** In Vue 2, a global directive is registered using `Vue.directive('directive-name', options)`.

### What syntax is used to apply a custom directive in a template?

- [x] v-your-directive
- [ ] :your-directive
- [ ] @your-directive
- [ ] #your-directive

> **Explanation:** Custom directives are applied in templates using the `v-your-directive` syntax.

### Which lifecycle hook is used to clean up when the directive is unbound from the element?

- [x] unbind
- [ ] bind
- [ ] update
- [ ] inserted

> **Explanation:** The `unbind` hook is called once when the directive is unbound from the element, allowing for cleanup.

### In Vue 3, which hook is equivalent to the `inserted` hook in Vue 2?

- [x] mounted
- [ ] beforeMount
- [ ] updated
- [ ] unmounted

> **Explanation:** In Vue 3, the `mounted` hook is equivalent to the `inserted` hook in Vue 2, called when the element is inserted into the DOM.

### How can you pass multiple parameters to a directive?

- [x] Use an object with `v-directive="{ prop1: value1, prop2: value2 }"`
- [ ] Use an array with `v-directive="[value1, value2]"`
- [ ] Use a string with `v-directive="value1, value2"`
- [ ] Use a number with `v-directive="2"`

> **Explanation:** Multiple parameters can be passed to a directive using an object, allowing access to properties via `binding.value.prop1`.

### What is a common use case for custom directives?

- [x] Integrating third-party libraries
- [ ] Defining Vuex modules
- [ ] Creating Vue Router links
- [ ] Styling components with CSS

> **Explanation:** Custom directives are commonly used to integrate third-party libraries that require direct DOM manipulation.

### Which hook would you use to update the directive when reactive data changes?

- [x] update
- [ ] bind
- [ ] inserted
- [ ] unbind

> **Explanation:** The `update` hook is called when the component's VNode updates, allowing the directive to respond to changes in reactive data.

### True or False: Custom directives can only be defined globally in Vue.js.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> **Explanation:** Custom directives can be defined both globally and locally within a component in Vue.js.
