## 8.2.5 Portals

### Introduction

In modern web development, especially with React, managing the rendering of components outside their parent DOM hierarchy is crucial for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. **Portals** in React provide a powerful solution for such scenarios, allowing developers to render components into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. This capability is particularly useful for implementing UI elements like modals, tooltips, and dropdowns that need to overlay other content seamlessly.

### Understanding the Concept

Portals in React enable rendering children into a DOM node that is different from the component's own root DOM node. This allows components to break free from the constraints of their parent containers, providing more flexibility in UI design and interaction.

### Implementation Steps

#### Import `ReactDOM`

To utilize portals, you need to import `ReactDOM` to access the `createPortal` method.

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```

#### Create a DOM Node for the Portal

In your HTML file, add a container element where the portal will render. This can be a static element in your HTML or dynamically created within your application.

```html
<div id="portal-root"></div>
```

#### Use `ReactDOM.createPortal`

Within your component, use `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)` to render the `child` component into the `container`. The `child` is any renderable React element, and the `container` is the DOM element you want to render into (e.g., the element with `id="portal-root"`).

#### Implement the Portal Component

Create a component that uses `createPortal` to render its children.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const Portal = ({ children }) => {
  const portalRoot = document.getElementById('portal-root');
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(children, portalRoot);
};

export default Portal;
```

#### Use the Portal Component

Wrap the content you want to render outside the parent hierarchy with the `Portal` component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Portal from './Portal';

const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;
  return (
    <Portal>
      <div className="modal-overlay" onClick={onClose}>
        <div className="modal-content" onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}>
          {/* Modal content */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </Portal>
  );
};

export default Modal;
```

### Code Examples

#### Implementing a Modal with Portals

Here's how you can implement a modal using portals:

**App.js**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Modal from './Modal';

function App() {
  const [isModalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const openModal = () => setModalOpen(true);
  const closeModal = () => setModalOpen(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Main Application</h1>
      <button onClick={openModal}>Open Modal</button>
      <Modal isOpen={isModalOpen} onClose={closeModal}>
        <h2>Modal Title</h2>
        <p>This is modal content rendered via a portal.</p>
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Modal.js**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Portal from './Portal';

const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;
  return (
    <Portal>
      <div className="modal-overlay" onClick={onClose}>
        <div className="modal-content" onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}>
          <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
          {children}
        </div>
      </div>
    </Portal>
  );
};

export default Modal;
```

### Use Cases

- **Modals and Dialogs:** Render modals, dialogs, pop-ups, or lightboxes that need to appear above other content.
- **Tooltips and Dropdowns:** Create tooltips or dropdown menus that require positioning outside of the parent container.
- **CSS Overflow and Z-Index Issues:** Overcome CSS overflow and z-index issues by rendering components at a higher DOM level.

### Practice

#### Exercise 1: Tooltip Component

Create a tooltip component that uses a portal to display information when hovering over a text element.

#### Exercise 2: Context Menu

Implement a context menu that appears at the mouse position, rendered via a portal.

### Considerations

- **Event Bubbling:** Events in a portal component propagate in the React tree as if the portal was a normal child, even though it is in a different place in the DOM.
- **Styling and CSS Scope:** Ensure that the necessary styles are applied or included in the global scope since the portal is rendered outside the parent hierarchy.
- **Accessibility:** Manage focus appropriately when using portals to ensure keyboard navigation works as expected. Use ARIA roles and properties to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Server-Side Rendering:** When rendering on the server, ensure that the DOM node for the portal exists or adjust your code to handle it appropriately.

### Tips

- Use portals to avoid breaking out of parent containers with `overflow: hidden` or to bypass stacking context issues.
- Clean up any event listeners or timers in `componentWillUnmount` or use `useEffect` cleanup functions in functional components.
- Test portal components thoroughly across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.

### Conclusion

React Portals offer a flexible and powerful way to manage component rendering outside the parent DOM hierarchy, making them an essential tool for modern web development. By understanding and implementing portals, developers can create more dynamic and interactive user interfaces, overcoming common challenges related to CSS and DOM structure.

### What is the primary purpose of React Portals?

- [x] To render components into a DOM node outside the parent component's hierarchy
- [ ] To improve component performance
- [ ] To manage state across components
- [ ] To simplify component styling

> **Explanation:** React Portals allow components to be rendered into a DOM node that exists outside the parent component's hierarchy, providing flexibility in UI design.

### Which method is used to create a portal in React?

- [ ] React.createPortal
- [x] ReactDOM.createPortal
- [ ] ReactDOM.render
- [ ] React.createElement
