## 2.3.8 State

### Introduction

The State design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on its state. By encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes, the State pattern promotes cleaner, more maintainable code.

### Understanding the Intent

The primary intent of the State pattern is to enable an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This is achieved by delegating state-specific behavior to separate state classes, allowing the context object to switch between these states seamlessly.

### Key Components

- **Context:** The class whose behavior changes with state. It maintains a reference to an instance of a state subclass that defines the current state.
- **State Interface:** Defines methods corresponding to state-specific behaviors. This interface is implemented by all concrete state classes.
- **Concrete States:** Implement behaviors associated with a state of the context. Each concrete state class encapsulates behavior specific to a particular state.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define a State Interface:** Create an interface that declares methods for state-specific behaviors.
2. **Implement Concrete State Classes:** Develop concrete classes that implement the state interface, each representing a specific state.
3. **Modify the Context Class:** Update the context class to maintain a reference to a state object and delegate behavior to this object.

### Code Examples

Let's explore a practical implementation of the State pattern using a vending machine as an example. The vending machine will change its behavior based on its current state.

#### Vending Machine Example

```typescript
// State Interface
interface VendingMachineState {
    insertCoin(): void;
    selectProduct(): void;
    dispenseProduct(): void;
}

// Concrete State: NoCoinState
class NoCoinState implements VendingMachineState {
    private vendingMachine: VendingMachine;

    constructor(vendingMachine: VendingMachine) {
        this.vendingMachine = vendingMachine;
    }

    insertCoin(): void {
        console.log("Coin inserted.");
        this.vendingMachine.setState(this.vendingMachine.getHasCoinState());
    }

    selectProduct(): void {
        console.log("Insert coin first.");
    }

    dispenseProduct(): void {
        console.log("Insert coin first.");
    }
}

// Concrete State: HasCoinState
class HasCoinState implements VendingMachineState {
    private vendingMachine: VendingMachine;

    constructor(vendingMachine: VendingMachine) {
        this.vendingMachine = vendingMachine;
    }

    insertCoin(): void {
        console.log("Coin already inserted.");
    }

    selectProduct(): void {
        console.log("Product selected.");
        this.vendingMachine.setState(this.vendingMachine.getProductSelectedState());
    }

    dispenseProduct(): void {
        console.log("Select product first.");
    }
}

// Concrete State: ProductSelectedState
class ProductSelectedState implements VendingMachineState {
    private vendingMachine: VendingMachine;

    constructor(vendingMachine: VendingMachine) {
        this.vendingMachine = vendingMachine;
    }

    insertCoin(): void {
        console.log("Coin already inserted.");
    }

    selectProduct(): void {
        console.log("Product already selected.");
    }

    dispenseProduct(): void {
        console.log("Product dispensed.");
        this.vendingMachine.setState(this.vendingMachine.getNoCoinState());
    }
}

// Context: VendingMachine
class VendingMachine {
    private noCoinState: VendingMachineState;
    private hasCoinState: VendingMachineState;
    private productSelectedState: VendingMachineState;
    private currentState: VendingMachineState;

    constructor() {
        this.noCoinState = new NoCoinState(this);
        this.hasCoinState = new HasCoinState(this);
        this.productSelectedState = new ProductSelectedState(this);
        this.currentState = this.noCoinState;
    }

    setState(state: VendingMachineState): void {
        this.currentState = state;
    }

    getNoCoinState(): VendingMachineState {
        return this.noCoinState;
    }

    getHasCoinState(): VendingMachineState {
        return this.hasCoinState;
    }

    getProductSelectedState(): VendingMachineState {
        return this.productSelectedState;
    }

    insertCoin(): void {
        this.currentState.insertCoin();
    }

    selectProduct(): void {
        this.currentState.selectProduct();
    }

    dispenseProduct(): void {
        this.currentState.dispenseProduct();
    }
}

// Usage
const vendingMachine = new VendingMachine();
vendingMachine.insertCoin();
vendingMachine.selectProduct();
vendingMachine.dispenseProduct();
```

### Use Cases

The State pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- An object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change behavior at runtime.
- State-specific behavior needs to be encapsulated and separated from the context class.
- There is a need to avoid large conditional statements that manage state transitions.

### Practice

To practice implementing the State pattern, consider creating a state machine for a TCP connection with different states such as Closed, Listen, and Established. Each state should define behaviors specific to that state.

### Considerations

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** The State pattern promotes single responsibility by separating state-specific behavior into distinct classes.
- **Class Proliferation:** Be mindful of the potential proliferation of state classes, which can increase complexity. Manage this by grouping related states or using state hierarchies if necessary.

### Visual Aids

Below is a conceptual diagram illustrating the State pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        - State currentState
        + setState(State): void
        + insertCoin(): void
        + selectProduct(): void
        + dispenseProduct(): void
    }
    class State {
        <<interface>>
        + insertCoin(): void
        + selectProduct(): void
        + dispenseProduct(): void
    }
    class NoCoinState {
        + insertCoin(): void
        + selectProduct(): void
        + dispenseProduct(): void
    }
    class HasCoinState {
        + insertCoin(): void
        + selectProduct(): void
        + dispenseProduct(): void
    }
    class ProductSelectedState {
        + insertCoin(): void
        + selectProduct(): void
        + dispenseProduct(): void
    }

    Context --> State
    State <|.. NoCoinState
    State <|.. HasCoinState
    State <|.. ProductSelectedState
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- **Encapsulation:** State-specific behavior is encapsulated in separate classes.
- **Flexibility:** New states and behaviors can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Maintainability:** Reduces the complexity of the context class by delegating behavior to state classes.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complexity:** Can lead to a large number of state classes, increasing complexity.
- **Overhead:** May introduce additional overhead if the number of states is large.

### Best Practices

- **Use State Pattern Judiciously:** Consider the complexity and number of states before implementing the pattern.
- **Group Related States:** If possible, group related states to manage complexity and reduce the number of classes.
- **Leverage TypeScript Features:** Utilize TypeScript interfaces and classes to enforce state-specific behavior and ensure type safety.

### Comparisons

The State pattern is often compared to the Strategy pattern. While both patterns involve encapsulating behavior, the State pattern focuses on changing behavior based on an object's state, whereas the Strategy pattern involves selecting a behavior from a set of strategies.

### Conclusion

The State design pattern is a powerful tool for managing object behavior based on internal state changes. By encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes, it promotes cleaner, more maintainable code. However, careful consideration should be given to managing complexity and class proliferation.
