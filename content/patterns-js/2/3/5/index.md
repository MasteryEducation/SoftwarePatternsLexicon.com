## 2.3.5 Mediator

### Introduction

The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines an object to encapsulate how a set of objects interact. This pattern promotes loose coupling by preventing direct communication between objects, thereby reducing dependencies and enhancing maintainability.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Understand the Intent

- **Encapsulation of Interaction:** The Mediator pattern encapsulates the interaction logic between objects, allowing them to communicate indirectly through a mediator.
- **Loose Coupling:** By decoupling objects from each other, the pattern facilitates easier maintenance and scalability.

#### Key Components

- **Mediator Interface:** Declares methods used by colleague classes to communicate.
- **Concrete Mediator:** Implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleague classes.
- **Colleague Classes:** Objects that communicate through the mediator rather than directly with each other.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Mediator Interface:** Create an interface that declares methods for communication.
2. **Implement the Concrete Mediator:** Develop a class that implements the mediator interface and manages communication between colleague classes.
3. **Modify Colleague Classes:** Adjust colleague classes to interact with the mediator instead of directly with each other.

### Visual Aids

#### Mediator Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Mediator {
        +notify(sender: Colleague, event: string)
    }
    class ConcreteMediator {
        +notify(sender: Colleague, event: string)
    }
    class Colleague {
        +send(event: string)
        +receive(event: string)
    }
    Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
    Colleague --> Mediator
    ConcreteMediator --> Colleague
```

### Code Examples

#### Chat Room Implementation

Consider a chat room where participants send messages via a central mediator:

```typescript
interface ChatRoomMediator {
    showMessage(user: User, message: string): void;
}

class ChatRoom implements ChatRoomMediator {
    showMessage(user: User, message: string): void {
        const time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
        console.log(`${time} [${user.getName()}]: ${message}`);
    }
}

class User {
    private name: string;
    private chatMediator: ChatRoomMediator;

    constructor(name: string, chatMediator: ChatRoomMediator) {
        this.name = name;
        this.chatMediator = chatMediator;
    }

    getName(): string {
        return this.name;
    }

    send(message: string): void {
        this.chatMediator.showMessage(this, message);
    }
}

// Usage
const mediator = new ChatRoom();
const user1 = new User("Alice", mediator);
const user2 = new User("Bob", mediator);

user1.send("Hello, Bob!");
user2.send("Hi, Alice!");
```

#### Form Components Notification

Explore form components that notify a mediator on events:

```typescript
interface FormMediator {
    notify(sender: Component, event: string): void;
}

class ConcreteFormMediator implements FormMediator {
    private button: Button;
    private textBox: TextBox;

    setButton(button: Button): void {
        this.button = button;
    }

    setTextBox(textBox: TextBox): void {
        this.textBox = textBox;
    }

    notify(sender: Component, event: string): void {
        if (event === "textChanged") {
            this.button.setEnabled(this.textBox.getText().length > 0);
        }
    }
}

abstract class Component {
    protected mediator: FormMediator;

    constructor(mediator: FormMediator) {
        this.mediator = mediator;
    }
}

class Button extends Component {
    private enabled: boolean = false;

    setEnabled(enabled: boolean): void {
        this.enabled = enabled;
        console.log(`Button is now ${enabled ? "enabled" : "disabled"}`);
    }
}

class TextBox extends Component {
    private text: string = "";

    setText(text: string): void {
        this.text = text;
        this.mediator.notify(this, "textChanged");
    }

    getText(): string {
        return this.text;
    }
}

// Usage
const formMediator = new ConcreteFormMediator();
const button = new Button(formMediator);
const textBox = new TextBox(formMediator);

formMediator.setButton(button);
formMediator.setTextBox(textBox);

textBox.setText("Hello");
```

### Use Cases

- **Complex Communication Patterns:** When multiple objects need to communicate in complex ways, the mediator pattern simplifies interactions.
- **Centralized Control Logic:** Useful in scenarios like chat applications, form handling, and flight control systems.

### Practice

Implement a flight control system where airplanes communicate via a control tower mediator. This exercise will help solidify your understanding of the mediator pattern.

### Considerations

- **Simplification of Protocols:** The mediator pattern simplifies object protocols by centralizing communication.
- **Potential Complexity:** Be cautious of the mediator becoming a bottleneck or overly complex, as it centralizes control logic.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Reduced Coupling:** Objects are less dependent on each other, enhancing modularity.
- **Centralized Communication:** Simplifies debugging and maintenance by centralizing communication logic.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity in Mediator:** The mediator can become complex and difficult to manage if not designed carefully.
- **Single Point of Failure:** Centralizing communication can lead to a single point of failure.

### Best Practices

- **Keep Mediator Simple:** Avoid overloading the mediator with too much logic.
- **Use for Complex Interactions:** Apply the mediator pattern when interactions between objects are complex and need simplification.

### Comparisons

The mediator pattern can be compared to the Observer pattern, where the mediator centralizes communication, while the observer pattern decentralizes it through event subscription.

### Conclusion

The Mediator Design Pattern is a powerful tool for managing complex object interactions in JavaScript and TypeScript applications. By promoting loose coupling and centralizing communication, it enhances maintainability and scalability. However, careful design is necessary to prevent the mediator from becoming a bottleneck.
