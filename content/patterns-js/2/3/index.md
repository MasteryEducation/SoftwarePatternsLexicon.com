## 2.3 Hoisting, Scope, and Closures

Understanding hoisting, scope, and closures is crucial for mastering JavaScript and effectively implementing design patterns. These concepts form the backbone of JavaScript's execution model and influence how variables and functions behave in your code. Let's dive into each of these topics to unravel their complexities.

### Hoisting in JavaScript

**Hoisting** is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.

#### Variable Hoisting

In JavaScript, variable declarations using `var` are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // Outputs: undefined
var myVar = 5;
console.log(myVar); // Outputs: 5
```

In the above example, the declaration `var myVar;` is hoisted, but the assignment `myVar = 5;` is not. Therefore, the first `console.log` outputs `undefined`.

#### Function Hoisting

Function declarations are also hoisted, allowing you to call a function before it is defined in the code.

```javascript
sayHello(); // Outputs: "Hello, World!"

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

In contrast, function expressions are not hoisted. If you try to call a function expression before it is defined, you will encounter an error.

```javascript
// TypeError: sayGoodbye is not a function
sayGoodbye();

var sayGoodbye = function() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
};
```

#### Let and Const Hoisting

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted, but they are not initialized. This leads to a "temporal dead zone" where accessing the variable before its declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
console.log(myLetVar); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLetVar' before initialization
let myLetVar = 10;
```

### Scope in JavaScript

**Scope** determines the accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of your code. JavaScript has two types of scope: global scope and local scope.

#### Global Scope

Variables declared outside any function have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

```javascript
var globalVar = "I am global";

function checkScope() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Outputs: "I am global"
}

checkScope();
```

#### Local Scope

Variables declared within a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed from outside.

```javascript
function localScopeExample() {
  var localVar = "I am local";
  console.log(localVar); // Outputs: "I am local"
}

localScopeExample();
console.log(localVar); // ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
```

#### Block Scope

With the introduction of `let` and `const` in ES6, JavaScript now supports block scope. Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block `{}` are only accessible within that block.

```javascript
if (true) {
  let blockScopedVar = "I am block scoped";
  console.log(blockScopedVar); // Outputs: "I am block scoped"
}

console.log(blockScopedVar); // ReferenceError: blockScopedVar is not defined
```

### Closures in JavaScript

**Closures** are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow a function to access variables from its outer lexical environment, even after that function has finished executing. Closures are created whenever a function is defined inside another function.

#### Creating Closures

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log("Outer Variable: " + outerVariable);
    console.log("Inner Variable: " + innerVariable);
  };
}

const newFunction = outerFunction("outside");
newFunction("inside");
// Outputs:
// Outer Variable: outside
// Inner Variable: inside
```

In this example, `innerFunction` forms a closure that captures `outerVariable` from its outer lexical environment.

#### Practical Use of Closures

Closures are often used to create private variables or functions.

```javascript
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count += 1;
    return count;
  };
}

const increment = counter();
console.log(increment()); // Outputs: 1
console.log(increment()); // Outputs: 2
```

Here, `count` is a private variable that can only be accessed and modified by the returned function.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

#### Avoiding Global Variables

Global variables can lead to conflicts and bugs, especially in large codebases. Use local variables and closures to encapsulate functionality.

#### Understanding the Temporal Dead Zone

Be aware of the temporal dead zone when using `let` and `const`. Always declare variables at the top of their scope to avoid `ReferenceError`.

#### Proper Use of Closures

Closures can lead to memory leaks if not used carefully. Ensure that closures do not unintentionally capture large objects or DOM elements.

### Visualizing Scope and Closures

  B --> D[Closure]
  D --> E[Outer Function]
  D --> F[Inner Function]
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the relationship between global scope, function scope, block scope, and closures. It shows how closures capture variables from their outer function.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code examples:

1. Modify the `counter` function to allow decrementing the count.
2. Create a closure that keeps track of the number of times a button is clicked on a webpage.
