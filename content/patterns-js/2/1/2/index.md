## 2.1.2 Builder

### Introduction

The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that provides a flexible solution to constructing complex objects. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects that require numerous optional parameters or configurations.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of the Builder pattern is to manage the construction of complex objects. By decoupling the construction process from the final representation, it allows for more control over the creation process and supports various configurations.

### Key Components

1. **Builder Interface:** Defines the methods for creating the different parts of the product.
2. **Concrete Builders:** Implement the builder interface to construct and assemble parts of the product.
3. **Director:** Oversees the construction process using the builder interface.
4. **Product:** The complex object that is being built.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Product Class:** Create a class representing the complex object with all possible components.
2. **Create a Builder Interface:** Define methods to build each component of the product.
3. **Implement Concrete Builder Classes:** Develop classes that provide specific implementations for building the product.
4. **Use a Director Class:** Construct the product using a builder to manage the construction process.

### Code Examples

#### JavaScript Implementation

Let's consider building a complex object like a car with various features:

```javascript
// Product
class Car {
    constructor() {
        this.parts = {};
    }

    addPart(partName, part) {
        this.parts[partName] = part;
    }

    showParts() {
        console.log(this.parts);
    }
}

// Builder Interface
class CarBuilder {
    reset() {}
    buildEngine() {}
    buildWheels() {}
    buildSeats() {}
    getResult() {}
}

// Concrete Builder
class SportsCarBuilder extends CarBuilder {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.reset();
    }

    reset() {
        this.car = new Car();
    }

    buildEngine() {
        this.car.addPart('engine', 'V8 Engine');
    }

    buildWheels() {
        this.car.addPart('wheels', '18 inch Alloy Wheels');
    }

    buildSeats() {
        this.car.addPart('seats', 'Leather Seats');
    }

    getResult() {
        return this.car;
    }
}

// Director
class Director {
    setBuilder(builder) {
        this.builder = builder;
    }

    constructSportsCar() {
        this.builder.reset();
        this.builder.buildEngine();
        this.builder.buildWheels();
        this.builder.buildSeats();
    }
}

// Usage
const director = new Director();
const sportsCarBuilder = new SportsCarBuilder();

director.setBuilder(sportsCarBuilder);
director.constructSportsCar();

const sportsCar = sportsCarBuilder.getResult();
sportsCar.showParts();
```

#### TypeScript Implementation

The TypeScript implementation adds type safety and interfaces:

```typescript
// Product
class Car {
    private parts: { [key: string]: string } = {};

    public addPart(partName: string, part: string): void {
        this.parts[partName] = part;
    }

    public showParts(): void {
        console.log(this.parts);
    }
}

// Builder Interface
interface CarBuilder {
    reset(): void;
    buildEngine(): void;
    buildWheels(): void;
    buildSeats(): void;
    getResult(): Car;
}

// Concrete Builder
class SportsCarBuilder implements CarBuilder {
    private car: Car;

    constructor() {
        this.reset();
    }

    public reset(): void {
        this.car = new Car();
    }

    public buildEngine(): void {
        this.car.addPart('engine', 'V8 Engine');
    }

    public buildWheels(): void {
        this.car.addPart('wheels', '18 inch Alloy Wheels');
    }

    public buildSeats(): void {
        this.car.addPart('seats', 'Leather Seats');
    }

    public getResult(): Car {
        return this.car;
    }
}

// Director
class Director {
    private builder: CarBuilder;

    public setBuilder(builder: CarBuilder): void {
        this.builder = builder;
    }

    public constructSportsCar(): void {
        this.builder.reset();
        this.builder.buildEngine();
        this.builder.buildWheels();
        this.builder.buildSeats();
    }
}

// Usage
const director = new Director();
const sportsCarBuilder = new SportsCarBuilder();

director.setBuilder(sportsCarBuilder);
director.constructSportsCar();

const sportsCar = sportsCarBuilder.getResult();
sportsCar.showParts();
```

### Use Cases

- **Different Representations:** When the construction process must allow different representations of the product.
- **Complex Objects:** Useful for creating objects with many configuration options, such as UI components, database queries, or network requests.

### Practice

Try creating a builder for assembling computers with customizable components like CPU, RAM, storage, and graphics card. This exercise will help solidify your understanding of the Builder pattern.

### Considerations

- **Readability and Maintainability:** The Builder pattern improves the readability and maintainability of object creation code by separating the construction process.
- **Overhead:** Be aware of the overhead introduced by having multiple builder classes, which might be unnecessary for simple objects.

### Visual Aids

Below is a conceptual diagram illustrating the Builder pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Director {
        - builder: CarBuilder
        + setBuilder(builder: CarBuilder): void
        + constructSportsCar(): void
    }

    class CarBuilder {
        + reset(): void
        + buildEngine(): void
        + buildWheels(): void
        + buildSeats(): void
        + getResult(): Car
    }

    class SportsCarBuilder {
        - car: Car
        + reset(): void
        + buildEngine(): void
        + buildWheels(): void
        + buildSeats(): void
        + getResult(): Car
    }

    class Car {
        - parts: Map~string, string~
        + addPart(partName: string, part: string): void
        + showParts(): void
    }

    Director --> CarBuilder
    CarBuilder <|-- SportsCarBuilder
    CarBuilder --> Car
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- Provides control over the construction process.
- Supports multiple representations of the product.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.

**Disadvantages:**
- Can introduce unnecessary complexity for simple objects.
- Requires additional classes, which may increase codebase size.

### Best Practices

- Use the Builder pattern when dealing with complex objects that require multiple configurations.
- Ensure that the builder interface is flexible enough to accommodate future changes or extensions.
- Consider using the pattern in conjunction with other design patterns for more robust solutions.

### Comparisons

The Builder pattern is often compared with the Factory pattern. While both are creational patterns, the Builder pattern is more suited for constructing complex objects step-by-step, whereas the Factory pattern is used for creating objects in a single step.

### Conclusion

The Builder pattern is a powerful tool for managing the construction of complex objects in JavaScript and TypeScript. By separating the construction process from the representation, it provides flexibility, control, and clarity in code. Understanding and implementing this pattern can significantly enhance your ability to manage complex object creation in your applications.
