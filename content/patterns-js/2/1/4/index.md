## 2.1.4 Prototype

### Introduction

The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones. This pattern is particularly useful when object creation is resource-intensive, and you want to avoid the overhead of creating objects from scratch. By using the Prototype pattern, you can improve performance and simplify object creation in your JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

### Understand the Intent

- **Cloning Objects:** The Prototype pattern focuses on creating new objects by copying existing ones, rather than instantiating new objects from a class.
- **Performance Improvement:** By cloning existing objects, you can reduce the computational cost associated with object creation, especially when dealing with complex objects.

### Key Components

- **Prototype Interface:** Declares a method for cloning itself.
- **Concrete Prototype:** Implements the cloning method, allowing for the creation of new instances.
- **Client:** Utilizes the prototype to create new objects by cloning.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Objects to be Cloned:** Determine which objects in your application would benefit from cloning.
2. **Implement the Clone Method:** Ensure these objects implement a method to clone themselves.
3. **Use Prototypical Inheritance:** In JavaScript, leverage prototypical inheritance to facilitate cloning.

### Code Examples

#### JavaScript Example

In JavaScript, the Prototype pattern can be implemented using prototypical inheritance. Here's an example of how you might clone a shape object:

```javascript
// Prototype Interface
class Shape {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    clone() {
        return Object.create(this);
    }
}

// Concrete Prototype
const circle = new Shape('Circle');

// Client
const anotherCircle = circle.clone();
anotherCircle.type = 'Another Circle';

console.log(circle.type); // Output: Circle
console.log(anotherCircle.type); // Output: Another Circle
```

#### TypeScript Example

In TypeScript, you can use interfaces to define the cloning method more explicitly:

```typescript
// Prototype Interface
interface Clonable {
    clone(): Clonable;
}

// Concrete Prototype
class Shape implements Clonable {
    constructor(public type: string) {}

    clone(): Shape {
        return Object.create(this);
    }
}

// Client
const circle = new Shape('Circle');
const anotherCircle = circle.clone();
anotherCircle.type = 'Another Circle';

console.log(circle.type); // Output: Circle
console.log(anotherCircle.type); // Output: Another Circle
```

### Use Cases

- **Resource-Intensive Object Creation:** When creating an object from scratch is costly in terms of resources.
- **Avoiding Subclassing:** To prevent the need for creating multiple subclasses of an object creator in the client application.

### Practice

Consider a scenario where you need to create multiple characters in a game. Each character has a set of attributes like health, strength, and agility. Using the Prototype pattern, you can create a prototype character and clone it to create new characters with different attributes.

```typescript
// Prototype Interface
interface GameCharacter {
    clone(): GameCharacter;
}

// Concrete Prototype
class Character implements GameCharacter {
    constructor(public name: string, public health: number, public strength: number) {}

    clone(): Character {
        return Object.create(this);
    }
}

// Client
const warrior = new Character('Warrior', 100, 50);
const mage = warrior.clone();
mage.name = 'Mage';
mage.health = 80;
mage.strength = 30;

console.log(warrior); // Output: Character { name: 'Warrior', health: 100, strength: 50 }
console.log(mage);    // Output: Character { name: 'Mage', health: 80, strength: 30 }
```

### Considerations

- **Shallow vs. Deep Copying:** Be aware of the difference between shallow and deep copying. Shallow copies duplicate the top-level properties, while deep copies duplicate all levels of nested objects.
- **Independence of Clones:** Ensure that cloned objects are independent of their originals to avoid unintended side effects.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Efficiency:** Reduces the cost of creating objects from scratch.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for easy creation of new object configurations.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity:** Managing deep copies can be complex, especially with nested objects.
- **Memory Usage:** Cloning large objects can increase memory usage.

### Best Practices

- **Use Deep Cloning Libraries:** Consider using libraries like Lodash for deep cloning when necessary.
- **Prototype for Configurable Objects:** Use the Prototype pattern for objects that have a lot of configurable properties.

### Comparisons

The Prototype pattern can be compared to other creational patterns like Factory and Singleton. While Factory focuses on creating objects without exposing the creation logic, Prototype emphasizes cloning existing objects. Singleton ensures a single instance, whereas Prototype allows multiple instances through cloning.

### Conclusion

The Prototype design pattern is a powerful tool for optimizing object creation in JavaScript and TypeScript applications. By understanding its components and implementation, you can leverage this pattern to improve performance and simplify object management. Consider the use cases and best practices discussed to effectively integrate the Prototype pattern into your projects.

### What is the main intent of the Prototype pattern?

- [x] To create new objects by cloning existing ones
- [ ] To ensure a class has only one instance
- [ ] To provide an interface for creating families of related objects
- [ ] To separate the construction of a complex object from its representation

> **Explanation:** The Prototype pattern focuses on creating new objects by cloning existing ones, which can improve performance by reducing the need to create objects from scratch.

### Which component of the Prototype pattern declares the cloning method?

- [x] Prototype Interface
- [ ] Concrete Prototype
