## 2.1.3 Factory Method

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into your code.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of the Factory Method pattern is to define an interface for creating an object, but to let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern is particularly useful when a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create beforehand or when it wants to delegate the responsibility of object creation to its subclasses.

### Key Components

1. **Product Interface:** Defines the type of objects the factory method creates.
2. **Concrete Products:** Implement the product interface.
3. **Creator (Abstract Class):** Declares the factory method returning a product instance.
4. **Concrete Creators:** Override the factory method to return an instance of a concrete product.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define a Product Interface:** Create an interface that defines the structure of the objects the factory method will create.
2. **Create Concrete Product Classes:** Implement the product interface in concrete classes.
3. **Create an Abstract Creator Class:** Define a class with a factory method that returns a product instance.
4. **Subclass the Creator:** Override the factory method in subclasses to create specific products.

### Code Examples

Let's explore how the Factory Method pattern can be implemented in JavaScript and TypeScript through a practical example.

#### JavaScript Example

Suppose we are building a document editor application that can create different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF).

```javascript
// Product Interface
class Document {
  open() {}
}

// Concrete Products
class WordDocument extends Document {
  open() {
    console.log("Opening a Word document.");
  }
}

class PDFDocument extends Document {
  open() {
    console.log("Opening a PDF document.");
  }
}

// Creator
class DocumentCreator {
  createDocument() {
    throw new Error("This method should be overridden!");
  }
}

// Concrete Creators
class WordDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
  createDocument() {
    return new WordDocument();
  }
}

class PDFDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
  createDocument() {
    return new PDFDocument();
  }
}

// Usage
const wordCreator = new WordDocumentCreator();
const wordDoc = wordCreator.createDocument();
wordDoc.open(); // Output: Opening a Word document.

const pdfCreator = new PDFDocumentCreator();
const pdfDoc = pdfCreator.createDocument();
pdfDoc.open(); // Output: Opening a PDF document.
```

#### TypeScript Example

```typescript
// Product Interface
interface Document {
  open(): void;
}

// Concrete Products
class WordDocument implements Document {
  open(): void {
    console.log("Opening a Word document.");
  }
}

class PDFDocument implements Document {
  open(): void {
    console.log("Opening a PDF document.");
  }
}

// Creator
abstract class DocumentCreator {
  abstract createDocument(): Document;
}

// Concrete Creators
class WordDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
  createDocument(): Document {
    return new WordDocument();
  }
}

class PDFDocumentCreator extends DocumentCreator {
  createDocument(): Document {
    return new PDFDocument();
  }
}

// Usage
const wordCreator: DocumentCreator = new WordDocumentCreator();
const wordDoc: Document = wordCreator.createDocument();
wordDoc.open(); // Output: Opening a Word document.

const pdfCreator: DocumentCreator = new PDFDocumentCreator();
const pdfDoc: Document = pdfCreator.createDocument();
pdfDoc.open(); // Output: Opening a PDF document.
```

### Use Cases

- **When a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create beforehand:** The Factory Method pattern allows the class to delegate the responsibility of object creation to its subclasses.
- **To delegate object creation to subclasses:** This pattern is beneficial when the base class wants to defer the instantiation of objects to its subclasses.

### Practice: Implement a Factory Method for a Game

Imagine a game where you need to create different types of enemy objects. You can use the Factory Method pattern to achieve this.

```typescript
// Product Interface
interface Enemy {
  attack(): void;
}

// Concrete Products
class Goblin implements Enemy {
  attack(): void {
    console.log("Goblin attacks with a club!");
  }
}

class Orc implements Enemy {
  attack(): void {
    console.log("Orc attacks with a sword!");
  }
}

// Creator
abstract class EnemyCreator {
  abstract createEnemy(): Enemy;
}

// Concrete Creators
class GoblinCreator extends EnemyCreator {
  createEnemy(): Enemy {
    return new Goblin();
  }
}

class OrcCreator extends EnemyCreator {
  createEnemy(): Enemy {
    return new Orc();
  }
}

// Usage
const goblinCreator: EnemyCreator = new GoblinCreator();
const goblin: Enemy = goblinCreator.createEnemy();
goblin.attack(); // Output: Goblin attacks with a club!

const orcCreator: EnemyCreator = new OrcCreator();
const orc: Enemy = orcCreator.createEnemy();
orc.attack(); // Output: Orc attacks with a sword!
```

### Considerations

- **Scalability:** The Factory Method pattern promotes scalability by allowing new products to be added without changing existing code.
- **Class Proliferation:** Be cautious of the potential increase in the number of classes, as each product requires a new subclass.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Flexibility:** The pattern provides flexibility in terms of object creation.
- **Loose Coupling:** It promotes loose coupling by separating the code that creates objects from the code that uses them.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity:** The pattern can introduce additional complexity due to the increased number of classes.
- **Overhead:** It may lead to unnecessary overhead if not used appropriately.

### Best Practices

- **Use Abstract Classes:** Define the creator as an abstract class to enforce the implementation of the factory method in subclasses.
- **Adhere to SOLID Principles:** Ensure that your implementation adheres to SOLID principles, particularly the Open/Closed Principle, to enhance maintainability.

### Conclusion

The Factory Method pattern is a powerful tool in the software developer's toolkit, offering a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. By understanding and applying this pattern, developers can build scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications.

- [x] To define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- [ ] To create a single instance of a class.
