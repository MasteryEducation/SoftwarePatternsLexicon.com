## 2.2.1 Adapter

### Introduction

In software development, it's common to encounter situations where you need to integrate classes or systems with incompatible interfaces. The Adapter design pattern, one of the classic Gang of Four (GoF) structural patterns, provides a solution by allowing these incompatible interfaces to work together seamlessly. This article delves into the Adapter pattern, its components, implementation in JavaScript and TypeScript, and real-world use cases.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter pattern is to bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces, enabling them to work together without modifying their existing code. This is particularly useful when integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems into modern applications.

### Key Components

- **Target Interface:** The interface expected by the client.
- **Client:** The class or system that requires functionality from an incompatible interface.
- **Adaptee:** The existing class or system with an incompatible interface.
- **Adapter:** A class that implements the target interface and translates requests from the client to the adaptee.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Incompatible Interfaces:** Determine the differences between the client's expected interface and the adaptee's interface.
2. **Create an Adapter Class:** Develop an adapter class that implements the target interface.
3. **Translate Calls:** Within the adapter, translate calls from the client to the adaptee, ensuring compatibility.

### Visual Representation

Here's a diagram illustrating the Adapter pattern structure:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Client {
        +request()
    }
    class Target {
        <<interface>>
        +request()
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    Client --> Target
    Adapter --> Target
    Adapter --> Adaptee
```

### Code Examples

#### JavaScript Example

Let's consider a scenario where we have a legacy logging system with a method `logMessage` and a new system that expects a method `log`. We'll create an adapter to bridge these interfaces.

```javascript
// Adaptee: Legacy Logger
class LegacyLogger {
    logMessage(message) {
        console.log(`Legacy log: ${message}`);
    }
}

// Target Interface
class Logger {
    log(message) {
        throw new Error("This method should be overridden!");
    }
}

// Adapter
class LoggerAdapter extends Logger {
    constructor(legacyLogger) {
        super();
        this.legacyLogger = legacyLogger;
    }

    log(message) {
        this.legacyLogger.logMessage(message);
    }
}

// Client
const legacyLogger = new LegacyLogger();
const loggerAdapter = new LoggerAdapter(legacyLogger);
loggerAdapter.log("Hello, Adapter Pattern!");
```

#### TypeScript Example

In TypeScript, we can leverage interfaces for stronger type checking.

```typescript
// Adaptee: Legacy Logger
class LegacyLogger {
    logMessage(message: string): void {
        console.log(`Legacy log: ${message}`);
    }
}

// Target Interface
interface Logger {
    log(message: string): void;
}

// Adapter
class LoggerAdapter implements Logger {
    private legacyLogger: LegacyLogger;

    constructor(legacyLogger: LegacyLogger) {
        this.legacyLogger = legacyLogger;
    }

    log(message: string): void {
        this.legacyLogger.logMessage(message);
    }
}

// Client
const legacyLogger = new LegacyLogger();
const loggerAdapter: Logger = new LoggerAdapter(legacyLogger);
loggerAdapter.log("Hello, Adapter Pattern!");
```

### Use Cases

- **Reusing Existing Classes:** When you want to reuse existing classes with incompatible interfaces.
- **Integrating Third-Party Libraries:** Facilitating the integration of third-party libraries into your application without modifying their code.

### Practice Exercise

Try implementing an adapter that allows a modern payment interface to work with a legacy payment system. This exercise will help solidify your understanding of the Adapter pattern.

### Considerations

- **Class vs. Object Adapters:** Class adapters use inheritance, while object adapters use composition. Choose based on your specific needs and constraints.
- **Complexity:** Be mindful of added complexity. Keep adapters simple and focused on translating interfaces.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- Facilitates integration of incompatible interfaces.
- Promotes code reusability and flexibility.

**Disadvantages:**

- Can introduce additional complexity.
- May lead to performance overhead if not implemented carefully.

### Best Practices

- Ensure adapters are lightweight and focused on interface translation.
- Use object adapters over class adapters when possible to favor composition over inheritance.

### Conclusion

The Adapter pattern is a powerful tool for integrating incompatible interfaces in JavaScript and TypeScript applications. By understanding its components and implementation, you can effectively bridge gaps between disparate systems, enhancing your application's flexibility and maintainability.
