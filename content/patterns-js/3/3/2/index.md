## 3.3.2 Class Decorators (TypeScript)

### Introduction

Class decorators in TypeScript provide a powerful mechanism to modify or enhance classes and their members without altering the original code. They enable developers to add metadata, enforce access control, log method calls, and much more. This article delves into the intent, implementation, and practical applications of class decorators, offering a comprehensive guide to leveraging this feature effectively.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of class decorators is to allow developers to modify or enhance classes and their members in a declarative manner. By using decorators, you can:

- Add metadata to classes for various purposes, such as dependency injection.
- Modify the behavior of methods or properties without altering the original class code.
- Implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, or access control.

### Implementation Steps

To implement class decorators in TypeScript, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Experimental Decorators:**
   - Ensure that the `experimentalDecorators` option is enabled in your TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`).

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "experimentalDecorators": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Define Decorator Functions:**
   - Create decorator functions for classes, methods, accessors, properties, or parameters. A class decorator is a function that takes a class constructor as its argument.

   ```typescript
   function LogClass(target: Function) {
     console.log(`Class Decorator Applied to: ${target.name}`);
   }
   ```

3. **Apply Decorators:**
   - Use the `@` symbol to apply decorators above the class or class member.

   ```typescript
   @LogClass
   class ExampleClass {
     constructor() {
       console.log('ExampleClass instance created');
     }
   }
   ```

### Code Examples

#### Class Decorator for Dependency Injection

A common use case for class decorators is registering classes for dependency injection. Here's how you can implement a simple class decorator for this purpose:

```typescript
function Injectable(target: Function) {
  // Register the class in a dependency injection container
  DependencyContainer.register(target);
}

@Injectable
class Service {
  constructor() {
    console.log('Service instance created');
  }
}
```

#### Method Decorator for Logging

Method decorators can be used to log method calls, providing insights into application behavior:

```typescript
function LogMethod(target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Method ${propertyKey} called with arguments: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class ExampleService {
  @LogMethod
  executeTask(taskName: string) {
    console.log(`Executing task: ${taskName}`);
  }
}

const service = new ExampleService();
service.executeTask('Task1');
```

### Use Cases

Class decorators are versatile and can be applied in various scenarios:

- **Metadata Addition:** Add metadata to classes for frameworks that rely on reflection, such as Angular or NestJS.
- **Behavior Modification:** Modify the behavior of class methods or properties without altering the original code.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Implement logging, validation, or access control across multiple classes.

### Practice

Try creating a method decorator that validates input parameters before executing the method. This can be useful for ensuring data integrity and preventing errors.

```typescript
function Validate(target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    if (args.some(arg => arg == null)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid arguments');
    }
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class DataService {
  @Validate
  fetchData(id: number) {
    console.log(`Fetching data for ID: ${id}`);
  }
}

const dataService = new DataService();
try {
  dataService.fetchData(null); // This will throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

### Considerations

- **Order of Execution:** Decorators are applied in the order they are declared, but executed in reverse order. Understanding this order is crucial for complex decorator chains.
- **Experimental Feature:** Decorators are an experimental feature in TypeScript and may change in future versions. Keep this in mind when using them in production code.

### Best Practices

- **Use with Caution:** Since decorators are experimental, use them judiciously and be prepared for potential changes in future TypeScript releases.
- **Combine with SOLID Principles:** Ensure that decorators enhance the code's adherence to SOLID principles, such as single responsibility and open/closed principles.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document the purpose and behavior of decorators to aid in code maintainability and readability.

### Conclusion

Class decorators in TypeScript offer a powerful way to enhance and modify classes and their members. By understanding their intent, implementation, and use cases, you can leverage decorators to write cleaner, more maintainable code. However, given their experimental nature, it's important to use them judiciously and stay informed about potential changes in future TypeScript versions.
