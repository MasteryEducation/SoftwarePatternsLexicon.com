## 3.3.1 Function Decorators

Function decorators are a powerful pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript that allow developers to extend the behavior of functions without modifying their original code. This pattern is particularly useful for adding cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, or validation.

### Understand the Intent

The primary intent of function decorators is to wrap functions to extend their behavior seamlessly. This approach promotes code reusability and separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and scale applications.

### Implementation Steps

To implement a function decorator, follow these steps:

1. **Define a Decorator Function:** Create a function that accepts another function as an argument.
2. **Return a New Function:** The decorator should return a new function that adds the desired functionality before or after executing the original function.

### Code Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of function decorators in JavaScript and TypeScript.

#### Example 1: Logging Execution Time

This decorator logs the execution time of a function, which is useful for performance monitoring.

```typescript
function logExecutionTime<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(fn: T): T {
    return function(...args: Parameters<T>): ReturnType<T> {
        const start = performance.now();
        const result = fn(...args);
        const end = performance.now();
        console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start}ms`);
        return result;
    } as T;
}

// Usage
const slowFunction = (num: number) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {}
    return num;
};

const decoratedFunction = logExecutionTime(slowFunction);
decoratedFunction(1000000);
```

#### Example 2: Error Handling and Retry

This decorator handles errors and retries the function a specified number of times.

```typescript
function retry<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(fn: T, retries: number = 3): T {
    return function(...args: Parameters<T>): ReturnType<T> {
        let attempts = 0;
        while (attempts < retries) {
            try {
                return fn(...args);
            } catch (error) {
                attempts++;
                console.log(`Attempt ${attempts} failed. Retrying...`);
            }
        }
        throw new Error(`Function failed after ${retries} attempts`);
    } as T;
}

// Usage
const unreliableFunction = (shouldFail: boolean) => {
    if (shouldFail) throw new Error("Failed!");
    return "Success!";
};

const safeFunction = retry(unreliableFunction, 3);
console.log(safeFunction(false)); // Success!
```

### Use Cases

Function decorators are ideal for scenarios where you need to add cross-cutting concerns, such as:

- **Logging:** Track function calls and execution times.
- **Caching:** Store results of expensive function calls to improve performance.
- **Validation:** Ensure input data meets certain criteria before processing.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors and implement retry logic.

### Practice

Try writing a decorator that caches the results of an expensive function call:

```typescript
function cache<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(fn: T): T {
    const cacheMap = new Map<string, ReturnType<T>>();
    return function(...args: Parameters<T>): ReturnType<T> {
        const key = JSON.stringify(args);
        if (cacheMap.has(key)) {
            console.log("Returning cached result");
            return cacheMap.get(key) as ReturnType<T>;
        }
        const result = fn(...args);
        cacheMap.set(key, result);
        return result;
    } as T;
}

// Usage
const expensiveFunction = (num: number) => {
    console.log("Computing...");
    return num * num;
};

const cachedFunction = cache(expensiveFunction);
console.log(cachedFunction(5)); // Computing... 25
console.log(cachedFunction(5)); // Returning cached result 25
```

### Considerations

When implementing function decorators, keep the following in mind:

- **Preserve Context and Arguments:** Ensure the original function's context (`this`) and arguments are preserved when calling it within the decorator.
- **Asynchronous Functions:** Be cautious with async functions, as decorators may need to handle promises or async/await syntax appropriately.

### Best Practices

- **SOLID Principles:** Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle by ensuring each decorator has a single purpose.
- **Code Maintainability:** Keep decorators simple and focused to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test decorators to ensure they work correctly with various function signatures and edge cases.

### Conclusion

Function decorators in JavaScript and TypeScript provide a flexible way to extend function behavior without altering their code. By understanding their intent and implementation, you can effectively apply decorators to add cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, and error handling. Remember to preserve the original function's context and arguments, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.

### What is the primary intent of function decorators?

- [x] To wrap functions and extend their behavior without modifying their code.
- [ ] To replace functions with new implementations.
- [ ] To convert synchronous functions to asynchronous ones.
- [ ] To optimize function performance by default.

> **Explanation:** Function decorators are designed to wrap functions and extend their behavior without altering the original code, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.

### Which of the following is a common use case for function decorators?

- [x] Logging

- [x] Handling promises or async/await syntax appropriately.
- [ ] Losing the original function's name.
- [ ] Increasing the function's execution time.
- [ ] Decreasing the function's readability.
