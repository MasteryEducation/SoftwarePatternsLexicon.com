## 11.6 Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Introduction

In the realm of web security, Content Security Policy (CSP) stands as a robust defense mechanism against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection vulnerabilities. By defining a set of rules that specify which content sources are considered trustworthy, CSP helps maintain the integrity and security of web applications. This article delves into the purpose, implementation, and best practices of CSP, particularly in the context of JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

### Understanding the Purpose of CSP

CSP is designed to prevent malicious content from being executed on your website. It achieves this by allowing developers to specify the origins of content that browsers should consider safe. This includes scripts, styles, images, and other resources. By whitelisting trusted sources, CSP mitigates the risk of XSS attacks, where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

### Implementation Steps

#### Define a CSP

The first step in implementing CSP is to define the policy itself. This involves specifying allowed sources for various types of content using the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header. Here's a basic example of a CSP header:

```plaintext
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
```

- **default-src 'self':** Allows resources to be loaded only from the same origin.
- **script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com:** Permits scripts from the same origin and Google's APIs.
- **style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline':** Allows styles from the same origin and inline styles (use with caution).

#### Implement CSP Headers

To enforce CSP, configure your web server or application to send the appropriate headers. In a Node.js application using Express.js, you can use the Helmet.js middleware to set CSP headers:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');

const app = express();

app.use(
  helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", 'https://apis.google.com'],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    },
  })
);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, CSP!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

#### Test and Monitor

Before fully enforcing CSP, it's prudent to test your policy using the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header. This allows you to monitor potential violations without blocking content, helping you fine-tune your policy. Violations can be logged to a specified endpoint for analysis.

```plaintext
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'self'; report-uri /csp-violation-report-endpoint/
```

### Code Examples

Here's a practical example of setting CSP headers in an Express.js application using Helmet.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');

const app = express();

app.use(
  helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", 'https://apis.google.com'],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:'],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", 'https://api.example.com'],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", 'https://fonts.googleapis.com'],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
      upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
    },
  })
);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('CSP is configured!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### Use Cases

CSP is particularly useful in scenarios where web applications handle sensitive data or are susceptible to injection attacks. By strictly controlling the sources of executable content, CSP significantly reduces the attack surface for XSS and other malicious activities.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`:** These directives can undermine the security benefits of CSP. Use nonce-based or hash-based approaches for inline scripts and styles.
- **Regularly Update CSP:** As your application evolves, update your CSP to reflect changes in resource loading patterns.
- **Monitor Violations:** Continuously monitor CSP violation reports to identify and address potential security issues.

### Considerations

Implementing CSP requires careful consideration of your application's content loading patterns. Overly restrictive policies may break functionality, while overly permissive policies may not provide adequate protection. Striking the right balance is key.

### Conclusion

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a powerful tool for enhancing the security of web applications. By defining and enforcing a set of rules for content loading, CSP helps prevent XSS attacks and other vulnerabilities. Implementing CSP in JavaScript and TypeScript applications, particularly with the help of tools like Helmet.js, can significantly bolster your application's security posture.

### What is the primary purpose of Content Security Policy (CSP)?

- [x] To prevent XSS attacks by specifying trusted content sources
- [ ] To enhance the performance of web applications
- [ ] To manage user authentication
- [ ] To optimize database queries

> **Explanation:** CSP is designed to prevent XSS attacks by allowing developers to specify which content sources are considered safe.

### Which HTTP header is used to define a CSP?

- [x] Content-Security-Policy
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security
- [ ] X-Frame-Options

> **Explanation:** The `Content-Security-Policy` header is used to define the rules for content loading in a web application.

### What is the role of the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header?

- [x] To test CSP policies by reporting violations without enforcing them
- [ ] To enforce CSP policies strictly
