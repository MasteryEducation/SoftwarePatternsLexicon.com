## 10.4 Promise Pooling

In modern web applications, managing asynchronous operations efficiently is crucial to ensure optimal resource usage and prevent system overload. Promise pooling is a concurrency pattern that helps control the number of concurrently executing Promises, making it an essential technique for developers working with JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Understand the Concept

Promise pooling allows developers to limit the number of concurrent asynchronous operations, thereby managing resource usage effectively. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where executing too many Promises simultaneously could overwhelm system resources, such as network bandwidth or CPU.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Resource Management:** Control over resource-intensive operations.
- **System Stability:** Prevents system overload by limiting concurrency.
- **Improved Performance:** Optimizes the execution of asynchronous tasks.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Set Concurrency Limit

The first step in implementing promise pooling is to decide on the maximum number of Promises to run concurrently. This limit should be based on the system's resources and the nature of the tasks.

#### 2. Prepare an Array of Tasks

Create a list of functions that return Promises. These functions represent the tasks you want to execute concurrently.

```javascript
const tasks = urls.map(url => () => fetch(url));
```

#### 3. Implement a Promise Pool

To manage the execution of tasks while maintaining the concurrency limit, you can use a loop, recursion, or helper libraries. The goal is to start new tasks as others complete.

#### 4. Use Helper Libraries (Optional)

Libraries like `p-limit` or `promise-pool` can simplify the implementation of promise pooling. Here's an example using `p-limit`:

```javascript
const pLimit = require('p-limit');
const limit = pLimit(5);
const promises = tasks.map(task => limit(() => task()));
Promise.all(promises).then(results => {
  // Handle results
});
```

### Code Examples

#### Custom Promise Pool Function

Below is a custom implementation of a promise pool function that controls the concurrency of task execution:

```javascript
async function promisePool(tasks, poolLimit) {
  const results = [];
  const executing = [];
  for (const task of tasks) {
    const p = task().then(result => {
      executing.splice(executing.indexOf(p), 1);
      return result;
    });
    results.push(p);
    executing.push(p);
    if (executing.length >= poolLimit) {
      await Promise.race(executing);
    }
  }
  return Promise.all(results);
}

// Usage
promisePool(tasks, 3).then(allResults => {
  console.log('All tasks completed');
});
```

### Use Cases

Promise pooling is applicable in various scenarios, including:

- **Downloading Multiple Files:** Manage network bandwidth by limiting concurrent downloads.
- **Processing Large Datasets:** Handle resource-intensive operations without overwhelming the system.

### Practice

**Exercise:** Write a script that processes an array of images with the following requirements:

- Limit processing to 4 images concurrently.
- Resize images and save them to disk.
- Use promise pooling to manage concurrency.

### Considerations

When implementing promise pooling, keep the following considerations in mind:

- **Memory Management:** Monitor for potential memory leaks by ensuring Promises are properly resolved or rejected.
- **Pool Size Adjustment:** Adjust the pool size based on performance testing and resource availability.
- **Error Handling:** Handle exceptions within tasks to prevent unhandled rejections.

### Advanced Topics

#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Incorporating promise pooling within a DDD framework can enhance the management of domain events and aggregates, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.

#### Event Sourcing

Promise pooling can support event sourcing architectures by controlling the concurrency of event processing, ensuring that system resources are not overwhelmed.

### Conclusion

Promise pooling is a powerful concurrency pattern that helps manage asynchronous operations efficiently in JavaScript and TypeScript applications. By controlling the number of concurrently executing Promises, developers can optimize resource usage, prevent system overload, and improve overall application performance.

### What is the primary purpose of promise pooling?

- [x] To control the number of concurrently executing Promises
- [ ] To execute all Promises simultaneously
- [ ] To delay the execution of Promises indefinitely
- [ ] To cancel all pending Promises

> **Explanation:** Promise pooling is used to control the number of concurrently executing Promises to manage resource usage effectively.

### Which library can be used to simplify promise pooling in JavaScript?

- [x] p-limit
- [ ] lodash
- [ ] axios
- [ ] express

> **Explanation:** The `p-limit` library is commonly used to simplify the implementation of promise pooling by limiting the number of concurrent executions.

### In the custom promise pool function, what does `Promise.race(executing)` do?

- [x] Waits for the fastest Promise to settle
- [ ] Waits for all Promises to settle
- [ ] Cancels all running Promises
- [ ] Executes all Promises simultaneously

> **Explanation:** `Promise.race(executing)` waits for the fastest Promise to settle, allowing the pool to start a new task once a Promise completes.

### What is a potential risk of not handling exceptions in tasks within a promise pool?

- [x] Unhandled rejections
- [ ] Faster execution
- [ ] Increased concurrency
- [ ] Reduced resource usage

> **Explanation:** Not handling exceptions can lead to unhandled rejections, which can cause issues in the application.

### Which of the following is a use case for promise pooling?

- [x] Downloading multiple files without exceeding network bandwidth
- [ ] Executing a single synchronous task
- [ ] Running a single Promise
- [ ] Delaying all tasks indefinitely

> **Explanation:** Promise pooling is useful for downloading multiple files without exceeding network bandwidth by controlling concurrency.

### What should be considered when setting the concurrency limit for promise pooling?

- [x] System resources and task nature
- [ ] The number of tasks only
- [ ] The size of each task
- [ ] The time of day

> **Explanation:** The concurrency limit should be based on system resources and the nature of the tasks to ensure optimal performance.

### How does promise pooling improve system stability?

- [x] By preventing system overload
- [ ] By increasing the number of concurrent tasks
- [ ] By delaying task execution
- [ ] By reducing task complexity

> **Explanation:** Promise pooling improves system stability by preventing system overload through controlled concurrency.

### What is a benefit of using helper libraries for promise pooling?

- [x] Simplified implementation
- [ ] Increased complexity
- [ ] Reduced performance
- [ ] Delayed execution

> **Explanation:** Helper libraries like `p-limit` simplify the implementation of promise pooling by providing easy-to-use concurrency controls.

### Which pattern is promise pooling an example of?

- [x] Concurrency pattern
- [ ] Structural pattern
- [ ] Behavioral pattern

> **Explanation:** Promise pooling is an example of a concurrency pattern, which deals with managing concurrent operations.

### True or False: Promise pooling can help optimize resource usage in asynchronous operations.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> **Explanation:** True. Promise pooling helps optimize resource usage by controlling the number of concurrently executing Promises.
