## 10.5 Object Composition over Inheritance

In the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP), developers often face the decision of whether to use inheritance or composition to build their applications. While inheritance has been a staple in OOP, object composition offers a more flexible and maintainable approach, especially in JavaScript. In this section, we will explore the concept of object composition, its advantages over inheritance, and how to effectively implement it in JavaScript.

### Understanding Object Composition

Object composition is a design principle that involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones. Unlike inheritance, which creates a hierarchy of classes, composition focuses on assembling objects with specific behaviors and properties. This approach allows for greater flexibility and reusability, as objects can be easily modified or extended without altering existing code.

#### Key Differences Between Composition and Inheritance

- **Inheritance**: Involves creating a class hierarchy where child classes inherit properties and methods from parent classes. This can lead to tightly coupled code and deep inheritance chains, making maintenance difficult.
- **Composition**: Involves assembling objects from smaller, reusable components. This promotes loose coupling and enhances code flexibility.

### Drawbacks of Deep Inheritance Hierarchies

Deep inheritance hierarchies can lead to several issues:

- **Tight Coupling**: Changes in a parent class can have unintended consequences on child classes, leading to fragile code.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Inheritance locks you into a specific class structure, making it difficult to adapt to changing requirements.
- **Code Duplication**: Common functionality may be duplicated across different branches of the hierarchy.
- **Complexity**: Managing and understanding deep hierarchies can become cumbersome, especially in large codebases.

### Benefits of Object Composition

Object composition offers several advantages over inheritance:

- **Flexibility**: Objects can be easily extended or modified by adding or removing components.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different objects, reducing code duplication.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to a component do not affect other parts of the system, making maintenance easier.
- **Decoupling**: Promotes loose coupling between components, leading to more robust and adaptable code.

### Implementing Object Composition in JavaScript

JavaScript's dynamic nature makes it well-suited for object composition. Let's explore some techniques for composing objects in JavaScript.

#### Using Mixins

Mixins are a way to add functionality to objects by copying properties and methods from one object to another. This allows for the reuse of code across different objects without the need for inheritance.

```javascript
// Define a mixin with shared functionality
const canFly = {
  fly() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying!`);
  }
};

// Define a mixin with another shared functionality
const canSwim = {
  swim() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is swimming!`);
  }
};

// Create an object and compose it with mixins
const bird = {
  name: 'Eagle',
  ...canFly
};

const fish = {
  name: 'Shark',
  ...canSwim
};

bird.fly(); // Output: Eagle is flying!
fish.swim(); // Output: Shark is swimming!
```

#### Delegation

Delegation involves forwarding method calls from one object to another. This allows objects to share behavior without inheriting from a common parent.

```javascript
// Define a delegate object
const printer = {
  print() {
    console.log('Printing...');
  }
};

// Define an object that delegates to the printer
const document = {
  title: 'My Document',
  print() {
    printer.print();
  }
};

document.print(); // Output: Printing...
```

### Design Patterns Encouraging Composition

Several design patterns promote object composition over inheritance. Let's explore some of these patterns.

#### Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

```javascript
// Base class
class Coffee {
  cost() {
    return 5;
  }
}

// Decorator class
class MilkDecorator {
  constructor(coffee) {
    this.coffee = coffee;
  }

  cost() {
    return this.coffee.cost() + 1;
  }
}

// Usage
let myCoffee = new Coffee();
myCoffee = new MilkDecorator(myCoffee);

console.log(myCoffee.cost()); // Output: 6
```

#### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

```javascript
// Define strategies
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

// Context class
class Calculator {
  constructor(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  execute(a, b) {
    return this.strategy(a, b);
  }
}

// Usage
const addition = new Calculator(add);
console.log(addition.execute(2, 3)); // Output: 5

const multiplication = new Calculator(multiply);
console.log(multiplication.execute(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

### When to Choose Composition Over Inheritance

While both inheritance and composition have their place in software design, composition is often the preferred choice in the following scenarios:

- **Dynamic Behavior**: When you need to change the behavior of objects at runtime.
- **Code Reusability**: When you want to reuse functionality across different parts of your application.
- **Avoiding Fragile Base Class Problem**: When changes to a base class should not affect derived classes.
- **Simplifying Code**: When you want to avoid the complexity of deep inheritance hierarchies.

### Visualizing Object Composition

To better understand object composition, let's visualize how objects interact using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation()
    }
    class Decorator {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorA {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorB {
        +operation()
    }
    
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorA
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorB
    Decorator o-- Component
```

In this diagram, `ConcreteComponent` is the base object, and `ConcreteDecoratorA` and `ConcreteDecoratorB` are decorators that add functionality to the base object. This illustrates how composition allows for flexible and dynamic behavior modification.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided in this section. Try adding new behaviors to objects using mixins or decorators. Consider how you might refactor existing code to use composition instead of inheritance.
