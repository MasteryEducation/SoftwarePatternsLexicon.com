## 10. Concurrency Patterns
### 10.1 Async Queue

Concurrency is a critical aspect of modern software development, especially in JavaScript and TypeScript, where asynchronous operations are prevalent. The Async Queue pattern is a powerful tool for managing concurrency by ensuring that asynchronous tasks are processed sequentially, preventing resource saturation and maintaining system stability.

## Understanding the Concept

The Async Queue pattern is designed to handle asynchronous tasks one after another, ensuring that only one task is processed at a time. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where resource constraints or external service limitations require careful management of concurrent operations.

### Key Features:
- **Sequential Processing:** Tasks are processed in the order they are added to the queue, ensuring predictable execution.
- **Resource Management:** By controlling the number of concurrent operations, the Async Queue prevents resource saturation and potential system overload.
- **Dynamic Task Addition:** New tasks can be added to the queue at any time, allowing for flexible and responsive task management.

## Implementation Steps

Implementing an Async Queue involves several key steps, each contributing to the overall functionality and reliability of the pattern.

### 1. Define an Async Queue Structure

The first step is to define a structure to hold the tasks. This can be an array or a dedicated queue data structure. The choice of structure depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.

### 2. Create Task Functions

Each task in the queue should be an asynchronous function that returns a Promise. This ensures that tasks can be processed using modern asynchronous techniques such as `async/await` or Promise chaining.

### 3. Sequential Execution

To process tasks sequentially, use a loop or recursion to handle one task at a time. This can be achieved using `await` in an `async` function or by chaining Promises with `.then()`.

### 4. Add Tasks to the Queue

Provide a method to enqueue new tasks dynamically. This allows the queue to adapt to changing requirements and handle tasks as they arise.

### 5. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to manage task failures gracefully. This can be done using try/catch blocks or `.catch()` with Promises.

## Code Examples

Let's explore a simple implementation of an Async Queue using `async/await` in JavaScript:

```javascript
class AsyncQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
    this.processing = false;
  }

  enqueue(task) {
    this.queue.push(task);
    this.processQueue();
  }

  async processQueue() {
    if (this.processing) return;
    this.processing = true;
    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const task = this.queue.shift();
      try {
        await task();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Task failed:', error);
      }
    }
    this.processing = false;
  }
}

// Usage
const queue = new AsyncQueue();
queue.enqueue(async () => {
  console.log('Task 1');
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
});
queue.enqueue(async () => {
  console.log('Task 2');
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
});
```

### Explanation:
- **Queue Structure:** The `AsyncQueue` class uses an array to store tasks and a boolean flag to track whether the queue is currently processing tasks.
- **Task Enqueuing:** The `enqueue` method adds a task to the queue and initiates processing if it is not already underway.
- **Sequential Processing:** The `processQueue` method processes tasks one at a time, using `await` to ensure each task completes before the next begins.
- **Error Handling:** Errors are caught and logged, allowing the queue to continue processing subsequent tasks.

## Use Cases

The Async Queue pattern is applicable in various scenarios where sequential task processing is essential:

- **Rate-Limiting API Calls:** Prevent exceeding service quotas by controlling the rate of API requests.
- **User Action Processing:** Ensure that user actions, such as saving documents, do not overlap and cause data inconsistencies.
- **File Upload Management:** Handle file uploads sequentially, ensuring one upload starts only after the previous one completes.

## Practice

To solidify your understanding of the Async Queue pattern, try implementing a queue to manage file uploads. Ensure that each upload begins only after the previous one has completed, and handle any errors that occur during the upload process.

## Considerations

When implementing an Async Queue, consider the following:

- **Dynamic Task Handling:** Ensure the queue can accommodate tasks added dynamically, adapting to changing requirements.
- **Potential Delays:** Be aware that the sequential nature of the queue may introduce delays in task execution, especially if tasks are long-running.

## Conclusion

The Async Queue pattern is a valuable tool for managing concurrency in JavaScript and TypeScript applications. By processing tasks sequentially, it prevents resource saturation and ensures efficient task management. Whether you're rate-limiting API calls or managing file uploads, the Async Queue pattern provides a robust solution for handling asynchronous operations.
