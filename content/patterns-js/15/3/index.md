## 15.3 Active Record Pattern

### Introduction

The Active Record Pattern is a popular architectural pattern used in software development to simplify data management. It combines data and behavior in a single object, allowing domain objects to manage their own persistence and retrieval from a database. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where simplicity and rapid development are prioritized, and when the domain logic closely aligns with the database schema.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Understanding the Concept

In the Active Record Pattern, each object represents a row in a database table, and the object's methods are responsible for interacting with the database. This means that domain objects not only hold data but also contain methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Data and Behavior:** The object encapsulates both the data (attributes) and the behavior (methods) related to database interactions.
- **Self-Persistence:** Objects are responsible for saving and loading themselves from the database, reducing the need for separate data access layers.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Define Active Record Models:**
   - Create classes for your entities that extend a base Active Record class or implement Active Record behavior. These classes represent tables in the database.

2. **Implement CRUD Operations Within Models:**
   - Add methods like `save`, `update`, `delete`, and `find` directly in the model classes. These methods handle the database interactions.

3. **Use ORMs or Libraries:**
   - Utilize libraries like Sequelize (for Node.js) that provide Active Record implementations. These libraries simplify the process of mapping objects to database tables.

4. **Handle Asynchronous Operations:**
   - Ensure that database operations return Promises or use async/await to handle asynchronous interactions efficiently.

### Code Examples

Let's implement a `User` class using the Active Record Pattern with Sequelize in a Node.js environment.

```typescript
import { Model, DataTypes } from 'sequelize';
import { sequelize } from './database'; // Assume sequelize instance is configured

class User extends Model {
  public id!: number;
  public name!: string;
  public email!: string;

  // Define CRUD operations
  public async saveUser(): Promise<void> {
    await this.save();
  }

  public static async findUserById(id: number): Promise<User | null> {
    return await User.findByPk(id);
  }

  public async updateUser(data: Partial<User>): Promise<void> {
    Object.assign(this, data);
    await this.save();
  }

  public async deleteUser(): Promise<void> {
    await this.destroy();
  }
}

// Initialize the User model
User.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    autoIncrement: true,
    primaryKey: true,
  },
  name: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  email: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true,
  },
}, {
  sequelize,
  modelName: 'User',
});

// Usage example
(async () => {
  const user = User.build({ name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' });
  await user.saveUser();
  console.log('User saved:', user);

  const foundUser = await User.findUserById(user.id);
  console.log('User found:', foundUser);

  await user.updateUser({ name: 'John Smith' });
  console.log('User updated:', user);

  await user.deleteUser();
  console.log('User deleted');
})();
```

### Use Cases

- **Rapid Development:** Ideal for projects where development speed is crucial, and the domain logic is straightforward.
- **Simple Domain Logic:** Suitable when the domain logic aligns closely with the database schema, minimizing the need for complex data transformations.

### Practice

To practice the Active Record Pattern, try creating Active Record models for different entities in your application. Use these models to perform various database operations, such as creating new records, updating existing ones, and deleting records.

### Considerations

- **Tight Coupling:** The Active Record Pattern can lead to tight coupling between business logic and data access code. This may reduce flexibility and make it harder to adapt to changes in the database schema.
- **Complex Domain Logic:** For applications with complex domain logic, consider using other patterns like Data Mapper, which separates data access from business logic.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Simplicity:** Combines data and behavior in a single object, simplifying the codebase.
- **Rapid Development:** Facilitates quick development cycles by reducing boilerplate code.
- **Direct Mapping:** Provides a straightforward mapping between objects and database tables.

#### Disadvantages

- **Coupling:** Tight coupling between data access and business logic can hinder flexibility.
- **Scalability:** May not scale well for applications with complex domain logic or large-scale systems.

### Best Practices

- **Use with Simple Schemas:** Apply the Active Record Pattern in applications with simple schemas and straightforward domain logic.
- **Leverage ORMs:** Use ORMs like Sequelize to streamline the implementation and management of Active Record models.
- **Asynchronous Handling:** Ensure all database operations are handled asynchronously using Promises or async/await.

### Comparisons

- **Active Record vs. Data Mapper:** The Active Record Pattern combines data and behavior, while the Data Mapper Pattern separates them, providing more flexibility for complex domain logic.
- **Suitability:** Choose Active Record for simple applications and Data Mapper for complex, large-scale systems.

### Conclusion

The Active Record Pattern is a powerful tool for managing data in JavaScript and TypeScript applications, especially when simplicity and rapid development are priorities. By understanding its implementation and best practices, developers can effectively leverage this pattern to streamline data management and enhance productivity.
