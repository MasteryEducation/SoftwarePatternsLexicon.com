## 29.3 Design Pattern Reference Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to the design patterns discussed in the guide. Each entry includes the pattern's name, category, intent, key components, and a simple diagram where applicable. Use this as a refresher or a starting point for deeper exploration.

### Creational Design Patterns

#### 1. Singleton Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Key Components**: Singleton class, private constructor, static instance method.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -Singleton instance
        -Singleton()
        +getInstance()
    }
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use closures to encapsulate the instance.

#### 2. Factory Method Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Key Components**: Creator class, ConcreteCreator classes, Product interface, ConcreteProduct classes.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Creator {
        +factoryMethod() Product
    }
    class ConcreteCreator {
        +factoryMethod() ConcreteProduct
    }
    class Product
    class ConcreteProduct
    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Product <|-- ConcreteProduct
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use functions to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic.

#### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Key Components**: AbstractFactory, ConcreteFactory, AbstractProduct, ConcreteProduct.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractFactory {
        +createProductA() AbstractProductA
        +createProductB() AbstractProductB
    }
    class ConcreteFactory1 {
        +createProductA() ConcreteProductA1
        +createProductB() ConcreteProductB1
    }
    class AbstractProductA
    class AbstractProductB
    class ConcreteProductA1
    class ConcreteProductB1
    AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory1
    AbstractProductA <|-- ConcreteProductA1
    AbstractProductB <|-- ConcreteProductB1
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Leverage object literals and factory functions.

#### 4. Builder Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Key Components**: Builder, ConcreteBuilder, Director, Product.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Builder {
        +buildPart()
    }
    class ConcreteBuilder {
        +buildPart()
        +getResult() Product
    }
    class Director {
        +construct() Product
    }
    class Product
    Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder
    Director --> Builder
    ConcreteBuilder --> Product
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use chaining methods to build objects step by step.

#### 5. Prototype Pattern
- **Category**: Creational
- **Intent**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
- **Key Components**: Prototype, ConcretePrototype, Client.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Prototype {
        +clone() Prototype
    }
    class ConcretePrototype {
        +clone() ConcretePrototype
    }
    class Client {
        +operation()
    }
    Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype
    Client --> Prototype
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Utilize JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.

### Structural Design Patterns

#### 6. Adapter Pattern
- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
- **Key Components**: Target, Adapter, Adaptee, Client.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
        +request()
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest()
    }
    class Client {
        +operation()
    }
    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter --> Adaptee
    Client --> Target
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use classes or functions to wrap incompatible interfaces.

#### 7. Decorator Pattern
- **Category**: Structural

- **Key Components**: Component, ConcreteComponent, Decorator, ConcreteDecorator.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation()
    }
    class Decorator {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecorator {
        +operation()
    }
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecorator
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use higher-order functions to add behavior.

#### 8. Facade Pattern
- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- **Key Components**: Facade, Subsystem classes.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Facade {
        +operation()
    }
    class Subsystem1 {
        +operation1()
    }
    class Subsystem2 {
        +operation2()
    }
    Facade --> Subsystem1
    Facade --> Subsystem2
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Simplify complex APIs with a single interface.

#### 9. Proxy Pattern
- **Category**: Structural
- **Intent**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Key Components**: Subject, RealSubject, Proxy.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        +request()
    }
    class RealSubject {
        +request()
    }
    class Proxy {
        +request()
    }
    Subject <|-- RealSubject
    Subject <|-- Proxy
    Proxy --> RealSubject
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use ES6 Proxy objects to intercept operations.

### Behavioral Design Patterns

#### 10. Strategy Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Key Components**: Strategy, ConcreteStrategy, Context.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Strategy {
        +algorithmInterface()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA {
        +algorithmInterface()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyB {
        +algorithmInterface()
    }
    class Context {
        +contextInterface()
    }
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
    Context --> Strategy
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use functions or classes to encapsulate algorithms.

#### 11. Observer Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Key Components**: Subject, Observer, ConcreteObserver.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        +attach(observer)
        +detach(observer)
        +notify()
    }
    class Observer {
        +update()
    }
    class ConcreteObserver {
        +update()
    }
    Subject --> Observer
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use events and callbacks to implement observer behavior.

#### 12. Command Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Key Components**: Command, ConcreteCommand, Invoker, Receiver.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        +execute()
    }
    class ConcreteCommand {
        +execute()
    }
    class Invoker {
        +invoke()
    }
    class Receiver {
        +action()
    }
    Command <|-- ConcreteCommand
    Invoker --> Command
    ConcreteCommand --> Receiver
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use functions as commands.

#### 13. Iterator Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Key Components**: Iterator, ConcreteIterator, Aggregate, ConcreteAggregate.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Iterator {
        +first()
        +next()
        +isDone()
        +currentItem()
    }
    class ConcreteIterator {
        +first()
        +next()
        +isDone()
        +currentItem()
    }
    class Aggregate {
        +createIterator()
    }
    class ConcreteAggregate {
        +createIterator()
    }
    Iterator <|-- ConcreteIterator
    Aggregate <|-- ConcreteAggregate
    ConcreteAggregate --> ConcreteIterator
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use ES6 iterators and generators.

#### 14. State Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
- **Key Components**: Context, State, ConcreteState.
- **Diagram**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        +request()
    }
    class State {
        +handle()
    }
    class ConcreteStateA {
        +handle()
    }
    class ConcreteStateB {
        +handle()
    }
    Context --> State
    State <|-- ConcreteStateA
    State <|-- ConcreteStateB
```

- **JavaScript Unique Features**: Use classes or objects to represent states.
