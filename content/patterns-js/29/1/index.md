## 29.1 Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions of key terms and concepts used throughout the guide, serving as a quick reference for readers. It is organized alphabetically for easy navigation.

### A

**Abstract Factory Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. See [Section 5.4](#54-abstract-factory-pattern).

**Asynchronous JavaScript**  
A programming paradigm that allows for non-blocking operations, enabling the execution of other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete. This is achieved using callbacks, promises, and async/await. See [Section 2.7](#27-asynchronous-javascript-callbacks-promises-and-asyncawait).

**Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)**  
A JavaScript module format that allows for asynchronous loading of modules, improving performance by loading only the necessary modules. See [Section 11.1](#111-module-systems-commonjs-amd-es-modules).

### B

**Behavioral Design Patterns**  
Patterns that focus on communication between objects, defining how they interact and fulfill their responsibilities. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns. See [Section 7](#7-behavioral-design-patterns-in-javascript).

**BigInt**  
A built-in object that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1, which is the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number primitive. See [Section 3.1.3](#313-symbols-and-bigint).

### C

**Callback Hell**  
A situation where callbacks are nested within other callbacks several levels deep, making code difficult to read and maintain. See [Section 8.2](#82-callbacks-and-callback-hell).

**Class**  
A blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. Introduced in ES6, classes in JavaScript are syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance. See [Section 3.4](#34-classes-and-object-creation-patterns).

**Closure**  
A feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to variables in its outer enclosing function's scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. See [Section 2.3](#23-hoisting-scope-and-closures).

**Command Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This pattern is useful for parameterizing methods with different requests, queuing requests, and logging the history of requests. See [Section 7.3](#73-command-pattern-with-function-queues).

**CommonJS**  
A module system used in Node.js that allows for the inclusion of modules in a synchronous manner. See [Section 11.1](#111-module-systems-commonjs-amd-es-modules).

### D

**Decorator Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. See [Section 6.2](#62-decorator-pattern-for-enhancing-objects).

**Dependency Injection**  
A design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing a program to follow the Dependency Inversion Principle. It involves passing dependencies (services) to a client (consumer) rather than having the client create them. See [Section 5.8](#58-dependency-injection-pattern).

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
An approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses complex domain logic. See [Section 28](#28-domain-driven-design-in-javascript).

### E

**ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)**  
A major update to JavaScript that introduced many new features, including classes, modules, arrow functions, and template literals. See [Section 1.2](#12-the-evolution-of-javascript-from-es3-to-esnext).

**Event Loop**  
A programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It is a fundamental part of JavaScript's concurrency model, allowing for non-blocking I/O operations. See [Section 2.9](#29-event-loop-and-concurrency-model).

**Event-Driven Architecture**  
A software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. See [Section 17.14](#1714-webhooks-and-event-driven-integration).

### F

**Factory Method Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. See [Section 5.3](#53-factory-method-pattern).

**Facade Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. See [Section 6.3](#63-facade-pattern-simplifying-complex-interfaces).

**Functional Programming**  
A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes the use of pure functions and avoiding shared state and mutable data. See [Section 2.6](#26-functional-programming-concepts).

### G

**Generator Function**  
A special type of function that can pause execution and resume at a later point, allowing for the generation of a sequence of values over time. See [Section 3.3.3](#333-generator-functions).

**Global Scope**  
The outermost scope in JavaScript where variables and functions are accessible from anywhere in the code. See [Section 2.3](#23-hoisting-scope-and-closures).

### H

**Hoisting**  
A JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. See [Section 2.3](#23-hoisting-scope-and-closures).

A function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. See [Section 9.3](#93-higher-order-functions-and-function-composition).

### I

**IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**  
A JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is a design pattern used to create a local scope for variables. See [Section 4.2](#42-iife-immediately-invoked-function-expression).

A mechanism in JavaScript where one object can inherit properties and methods from another object. JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance. See [Section 2.4](#24-the-prototype-chain-and-inheritance).

**Interface**  
A programming structure that allows the computer to enforce certain properties on an object (class). JavaScript does not have interfaces in the traditional sense but can simulate them using classes and objects.

### J

**JavaScript Engine**  
A program or interpreter that executes JavaScript code. Examples include V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) and SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox). See [Section 2.1](#21-understanding-the-javascript-engine).

### K

**Key-Value Pair**  
A fundamental data representation in JavaScript objects, where each key is a unique identifier associated with a value.

### L

**Lazy Loading**  
A design pattern that delays the initialization of an object until it is needed, improving performance and resource utilization. See [Section 13.6](#136-code-splitting-and-lazy-loading).

**Lexical Scope**  
The scope of a variable is determined by its position within the source code, and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope. See [Section 2.3](#23-hoisting-scope-and-closures).

### M

**Memoization**  
An optimization technique used to speed up function calls by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. See [Section 4.6](#46-memoization-techniques-and-lazy-initialization).

**Mixin**  
A class that provides methods that can be used by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. See [Section 4.17](#417-the-mixin-pattern).

**Module**  
A self-contained unit of code that can be reused across different parts of an application. JavaScript supports modules through ES6 module syntax, CommonJS, and AMD. See [Section 11.1](#111-module-systems-commonjs-amd-es-modules).
