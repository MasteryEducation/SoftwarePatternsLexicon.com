## 19.1 Glossary of Terms

In this section, we provide a comprehensive glossary of terms that are essential for understanding design patterns and programming concepts in JavaScript and TypeScript. This glossary aims to aid readers in grasping key concepts and terminologies used throughout the guide.

### A

- **Abstraction**: A programming concept that involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or system.

- **Adapter Pattern**: A structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface expected by the clients.

- **Aggregate**: In Domain-Driven Design, an aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit for data changes.

### B

- **Behavioral Patterns**: Design patterns that focus on communication between objects, ensuring that they can interact in a flexible and dynamic way.

- **Builder Pattern**: A creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step.

### C

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

- **Clean Architecture**: An architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and test.

- **Cohesion**: A measure of how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module or class are.

- **Composite Pattern**: A structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

- **Coupling**: The degree of direct knowledge that one class has of another. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured system.

### D

- **Decorator Pattern**: A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

- **Dependency Injection**: A technique where an object receives other objects that it depends on, rather than creating them internally.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: An approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical experts and domain experts to create a model that accurately reflects the business domain.

### E

- **Encapsulation**: A principle of object-oriented programming that restricts access to certain components of an object and can prevent the accidental modification of data.

- **Event Sourcing**: A pattern where state changes are logged as a sequence of events, allowing the reconstruction of past states.

### F

- **Factory Pattern**: A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Facade Pattern**: A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### G

- **Gang of Four (GoF)**: Refers to the authors of the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," which introduced 23 foundational design patterns.

### H

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: An architectural pattern that aims to create loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment through ports and adapters.

### I

- **Inheritance**: A mechanism in object-oriented programming where a new class is created from an existing class by extending its properties and behaviors.

- **Interface**: A contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement, without specifying how these methods should be implemented.

### J

- **JavaScript**: A high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development.

### L

- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: A principle of object-oriented programming that states objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of the program.

### M

- **Microservices**: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each implementing a specific business capability.

- **Module**: A self-contained unit of code that encapsulates a specific functionality and can be reused across different parts of an application.

### O

- **Observer Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes.

- **Open/Closed Principle**: A principle that states software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### P

- **Polymorphism**: A concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

- **Prototype Pattern**: A creational design pattern that involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### R

- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.

- **RxJS**: A library for reactive programming using Observables, making it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

### S

- **Singleton Pattern**: A creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **SOLID Principles**: A set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

- **State Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

- **Strategy Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

### T

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing optional static typing and other features.

### U

- **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**: A standardized modeling language used to visualize the design of a system.

### V

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

### W

- **Workflow**: A sequence of steps or tasks that are necessary to complete a particular process or achieve a specific outcome.

### Conclusion

This glossary serves as a quick reference for key terms and concepts related to design patterns and programming in JavaScript and TypeScript. As you progress through the guide, refer back to this glossary to reinforce your understanding of these essential terms.
