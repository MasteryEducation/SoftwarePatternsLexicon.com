## 19.2 Building Cross-Platform Desktop Applications

In today's interconnected world, the ability to create applications that run seamlessly across multiple operating systems is invaluable. JavaScript, traditionally a language for web development, has expanded its reach into desktop application development through frameworks like Electron and NW.js. This section will guide you through the process of building cross-platform desktop applications using these powerful tools.

### Introduction to Cross-Platform Desktop Development

Cross-platform desktop applications are designed to run on multiple operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, without requiring separate codebases for each platform. This approach saves time and resources, allowing developers to focus on creating a single, cohesive application.

**Electron** and **NW.js** are two popular frameworks that enable developers to build desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Both frameworks leverage Node.js to provide access to native system features, making it possible to create rich, interactive applications with a familiar web development stack.

### Setting Up a New Electron Project

Let's start by setting up a new Electron project. Electron is a framework that allows you to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It combines the Chromium rendering engine and Node.js into a single runtime.

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a New Directory**: Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

   ```bash
   mkdir my-electron-app
   cd my-electron-app
   ```

3. **Initialize npm**: Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install Electron**: Install Electron as a development dependency.

   ```bash
   npm install electron --save-dev
   ```

5. **Create Main Script**: Create a `main.js` file. This file will serve as the entry point for your application.

   ```javascript
   // main.js
   const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

   function createWindow() {
     const win = new BrowserWindow({
       width: 800,
       height: 600,
       webPreferences: {
         nodeIntegration: true,
       },
     });

     win.loadFile('index.html');
   }

   app.whenReady().then(createWindow);

   app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
     if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
       app.quit();
     }
   });

   app.on('activate', () => {
     if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
       createWindow();
     }
   });
   ```

6. **Create HTML File**: Create an `index.html` file to serve as the UI for your application.

   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>My Electron App</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Hello, Electron!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

7. **Update package.json**: Add a start script to your `package.json` to launch the application.

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "electron ."
   }
   ```

8. **Run Your Application**: Use npm to start your Electron application.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Understanding the Directory Structure

When building an Electron application, understanding the directory structure is crucial for organizing your code effectively.

- **`main.js`**: The main process script that controls the lifecycle of the application.
- **`index.html`**: The HTML file that serves as the UI for the application.
- **`package.json`**: Contains metadata about the application and scripts for running it.
- **`node_modules/`**: Directory where all the dependencies are installed.

### Handling Platform-Specific Features

Cross-platform applications often need to handle platform-specific features and differences. Electron provides APIs to detect the operating system and adjust functionality accordingly.

#### Detecting the Platform

You can use `process.platform` to determine the current operating system.

```javascript
if (process.platform === 'darwin') {
  console.log('Running on macOS');
} else if (process.platform === 'win32') {
  console.log('Running on Windows');
} else {
  console.log('Running on Linux');
}
```

#### Platform-Specific Code

Use conditional statements to execute platform-specific code. For example, macOS applications often keep running even when all windows are closed, while Windows applications typically exit.

```javascript
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit();
  }
});
```

### Code Examples Demonstrating Cross-Platform Compatibility

Let's explore a more advanced example that demonstrates cross-platform compatibility by integrating native menus.

```javascript
// main.js
const { app, BrowserWindow, Menu } = require('electron');

function createWindow() {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
    },
  });

  win.loadFile('index.html');
}

const isMac = process.platform === 'darwin';

const template = [
  // { role: 'appMenu' }
  ...(isMac ? [{
    label: app.name,
    submenu: [
      { role: 'about' },
      { type: 'separator' },
      { role: 'services' },
      { type: 'separator' },
      { role: 'hide' },
      { role: 'hideothers' },
      { role: 'unhide' },
      { type: 'separator' },
      { role: 'quit' }
    ]
  }] : []),
  // { role: 'fileMenu' }
  {
    label: 'File',
    submenu: [
      isMac ? { role: 'close' } : { role: 'quit' }
    ]
  },
  // { role: 'editMenu' }
  {
    label: 'Edit',
    submenu: [
      { role: 'undo' },
      { role: 'redo' },
      { type: 'separator' },
      { role: 'cut' },
      { role: 'copy' },
      { role: 'paste' },
      ...(isMac ? [
        { role: 'pasteAndMatchStyle' },
        { role: 'delete' },
        { role: 'selectAll' },
        { type: 'separator' },
        {
          label: 'Speech',
          submenu: [
            { role: 'startSpeaking' },
            { role: 'stopSpeaking' }
          ]
        }
      ] : [
        { role: 'delete' },
        { type: 'separator' },
        { role: 'selectAll' }
      ])
    ]
  },
  // { role: 'viewMenu' }
  {
    label: 'View',
    submenu: [
      { role: 'reload' },
      { role: 'forceReload' },
      { role: 'toggleDevTools' },
      { type: 'separator' },
      { role: 'resetZoom' },
      { role: 'zoomIn' },
      { role: 'zoomOut' },
      { type: 'separator' },
      { role: 'togglefullscreen' }
    ]
  },
  // { role: 'windowMenu' }
  {
    label: 'Window',
    submenu: [
      { role: 'minimize' },
      { role: 'zoom' },
      ...(isMac ? [
        { type: 'separator' },
        { role: 'front' },
        { type: 'separator' },
        { role: 'window' }
      ] : [
        { role: 'close' }
      ])
    ]
  },
  {
    role: 'help',
    submenu: [
      {
        label: 'Learn More',
        click: async () => {
          const { shell } = require('electron');
          await shell.openExternal('https://electronjs.org');
        }
      }
    ]
  }
];

const menu = Menu.buildFromTemplate(template);
Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu);

app.whenReady().then(createWindow);

app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (!isMac) {
    app.quit();
  }
});

app.on('activate', () => {
  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
    createWindow();
  }
});
```

### Best Practices for Writing Portable Code

1. **Abstract Platform-Specific Code**: Use functions to encapsulate platform-specific logic, making it easier to maintain and test.

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Leverage environment variables to configure platform-specific settings.

3. **Test on All Platforms**: Regularly test your application on all target platforms to ensure consistent behavior.

4. **Utilize Cross-Platform Libraries**: Use libraries that abstract away platform differences, such as `node-notifier` for notifications.

5. **Follow OS Guidelines**: Adhere to the design and interaction guidelines of each operating system to provide a native feel.

### Tools and Libraries for Cross-Platform Development

- **Electron Builder**: A complete solution to package and build a ready-for-distribution Electron app with “auto update” support out of the box.
- **Node-Notifier**: A Node.js module for sending cross-platform notifications.
- **Electron Forge**: A complete tool for creating, publishing, and installing modern Electron applications.

### Testing on All Target Platforms

Testing is a critical part of the development process. Ensure your application behaves consistently across all platforms by:

- **Automated Testing**: Use tools like Spectron for automated testing of Electron applications.
- **Manual Testing**: Regularly test the application manually on each platform.
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI pipelines to automate testing on different operating systems.
