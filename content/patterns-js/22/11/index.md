            for (const record of event.message.records) {
                console.log("Record type:  " + record.recordType);
                console.log("MIME type:    " + record.mediaType);
                console.log("=== data ===\n" + decoder.decode(record.data));
            }
        };
    }).catch(error => {
        console.log(`Error! Scan failed to start: ${error}.`);
    });
} else {
    console.log('Web NFC API not supported');
}
```

**Enhancements for PWAs:**

```javascript
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
    filters: [{ services: ['heart_rate'] }]
})
.then(device => {
    console.log('Connecting to GATT Server...');
    return device.gatt.connect();
})
.then(server => {
    console.log('Getting Heart Rate Service...');
    return server.getPrimaryService('heart_rate');
})
.then(service => {
    console.log('Getting Heart Rate Measurement Characteristic...');
    return service.getCharacteristic('heart_rate_measurement');
})
