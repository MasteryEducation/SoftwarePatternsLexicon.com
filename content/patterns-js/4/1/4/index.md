## 4.1.4 Currying and Partial Application

In the realm of functional programming, currying and partial application are powerful techniques that enable developers to write more modular, reusable, and expressive code. These patterns are particularly useful in JavaScript and TypeScript, where functions are first-class citizens.

### Understand the Concepts

#### Currying

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for more flexible function composition and reuse.

**Example:**

A function `add` that takes two arguments can be curried to take one argument at a time.

```javascript
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

const addFive = add(5);
console.log(addFive(10)); // Output: 15
```

#### Partial Application

Partial application involves fixing a few arguments of a function, producing another function with a smaller arity (fewer arguments). This is particularly useful for setting default configurations or parameters.

**Example:**

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const double = multiply.bind(null, 2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
```

### Implementation Steps

#### Currying Implementation

Currying can be implemented manually or with the help of libraries like Lodash, which provides utility functions for currying.

**Manual Implementation:**

```javascript
function curry(fn) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= fn.length) {
      return fn.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      return function(...nextArgs) {
        return curried.apply(this, args.concat(nextArgs));
      };
    }
  };
}

function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const curriedSum = curry(sum);
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6
```

**Using Lodash:**

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

const curriedSum = _.curry(sum);
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6
```

#### Partial Application Implementation

Partial application can be achieved using closures to retain fixed arguments.

**Example:**

```javascript
function partial(fn, ...fixedArgs) {
  return function(...remainingArgs) {
    return fn.apply(this, fixedArgs.concat(remainingArgs));
  };
}

function greet(greeting, name) {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}

const sayHelloTo = partial(greet, 'Hello');
console.log(sayHelloTo('Alice')); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Code Examples

#### Curried Function for Mathematical Operations

Let's create a curried function for a basic mathematical operation like addition.

```typescript
function add(a: number): (b: number) => number {
  return (b: number) => a + b;
}

const addTen = add(10);
console.log(addTen(5)); // Output: 15
```

#### Partially Apply Functions to Preset Configuration Options

Consider a logging function where you want to preset the log level.

```typescript
function log(level: string, message: string) {
  console.log(`[${level}] ${message}`);
}

const infoLog = partial(log, 'INFO');
infoLog('This is an informational message.'); // Output: [INFO] This is an informational message.
```

### Use Cases

- **Reusable Functions:** Currying and partial application are ideal for creating reusable functions with preset arguments, such as configuration settings or default parameters.
- **Function Composition:** These techniques facilitate function composition, allowing developers to build complex operations from simpler, smaller functions.

### Practice

Write a curried function that processes data with configurable steps. For instance, a function that filters, maps, and reduces an array.

```typescript
function processArray(filterFn: (item: number) => boolean) {
  return function(mapFn: (item: number) => number) {
    return function(reduceFn: (acc: number, item: number) => number, initialValue: number) {
      return function(arr: number[]) {
        return arr.filter(filterFn).map(mapFn).reduce(reduceFn, initialValue);
      };
    };
  };
}

const process = processArray((x) => x > 0)((x) => x * 2)((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
console.log(process([-1, 2, 3, -4, 5])); // Output: 20
```

### Considerations

- **Flexibility vs. Complexity:** While currying and partial application increase flexibility, they can also introduce complexity. It's crucial to balance these aspects to maintain code readability.
- **Readability:** Currying can improve readability by breaking down functions into smaller, more manageable parts. However, overuse can lead to convoluted code.

### Best Practices

- **Use Libraries:** Utilize libraries like Lodash for reliable and efficient currying and partial application.
- **Keep It Simple:** Avoid over-currying or over-partializing functions, which can lead to difficult-to-understand code.
- **Document Intent:** Clearly document the intent and usage of curried and partially applied functions to aid maintainability.

### Conclusion

Currying and partial application are essential techniques in functional programming, offering significant benefits in terms of code reuse and modularity. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can write more flexible and maintainable JavaScript and TypeScript code.
