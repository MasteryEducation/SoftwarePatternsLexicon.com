## 14.4 Data Encryption and Cryptography Libraries

In the digital age, securing data is paramount. Cryptography provides the tools and techniques to protect information from unauthorized access and tampering. This section delves into the fundamentals of cryptography, explores popular JavaScript libraries, and demonstrates how to implement secure data encryption and decryption in your applications.

### Understanding Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, only to be deciphered by those possessing the correct key. Let's explore the core concepts:

#### Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption

**Symmetric Encryption**: This involves a single key for both encryption and decryption. It's fast and efficient for large data volumes but requires secure key distribution.

- **Example Algorithms**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).

**Asymmetric Encryption**: Utilizes a pair of keys—public and private. The public key encrypts data, while the private key decrypts it. This method is slower but eliminates the need for key distribution.

- **Example Algorithms**: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

#### Hashing Functions

Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code. It's a one-way function, meaning you can't reverse it to retrieve the original data. Hashing is crucial for data integrity and password storage.

- **Example Algorithms**: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm), MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm).

#### Digital Signatures

Digital signatures verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. They use asymmetric encryption to create a unique signature that can be verified with the sender's public key.

### JavaScript Cryptography Libraries

JavaScript offers several libraries to implement cryptographic functions. Let's explore some of the most popular ones:

#### Node.js `crypto` Module

The `crypto` module in Node.js provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions.

**Example: Symmetric Encryption with AES**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Key and IV generation
const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc';
const key = crypto.randomBytes(32);
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

// Encrypting data
function encrypt(text) {
    const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(key), iv);
    let encrypted = cipher.update(text);
    encrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, cipher.final()]);
    return { iv: iv.toString('hex'), encryptedData: encrypted.toString('hex') };
}

// Decrypting data
function decrypt(text) {
    const iv = Buffer.from(text.iv, 'hex');
    const encryptedText = Buffer.from(text.encryptedData, 'hex');
    const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(key), iv);
    let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedText);
    decrypted = Buffer.concat([decrypted, decipher.final()]);
    return decrypted.toString();
}

const data = "Sensitive data";
const encrypted = encrypt(data);
console.log("Encrypted:", encrypted);
console.log("Decrypted:", decrypt(encrypted));
```

#### Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`)

The Web Crypto API provides a standard interface for performing cryptographic operations in web applications. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

**Example: Hashing with SHA-256**

```javascript
async function hashData(data) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const dataBuffer = encoder.encode(data);
    const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', dataBuffer);
    const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
    const hashHex = hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
    return hashHex;
}

hashData("Sensitive data").then(hash => console.log("SHA-256 Hash:", hash));
```

#### `bcrypt` for Password Hashing

`bcrypt` is a popular library for hashing passwords. It incorporates a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and allows you to adjust the computational cost.

**Example: Hashing and Verifying Passwords**

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const password = 'supersecretpassword';

// Hashing a password
bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("Hashed Password:", hash);

    // Verifying a password
    bcrypt.compare(password, hash, function(err, result) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log("Password Match:", result);
    });
});
```

#### `jsrsasign` for Digital Signatures

`jsrsasign` is a comprehensive library for handling digital signatures, RSA, and X.509 certificates in JavaScript.

**Example: Creating and Verifying Digital Signatures**

```javascript
const jsrsasign = require('jsrsasign');

// Generate RSA key pair
const rsaKeypair = jsrsasign.KEYUTIL.generateKeypair('RSA', 1024);
const privateKey = rsaKeypair.prvKeyObj;
const publicKey = rsaKeypair.pubKeyObj;

// Sign data
const data = "Important message";
const signature = new jsrsasign.KJUR.crypto.Signature({alg: "SHA256withRSA"});
signature.init(privateKey);
signature.updateString(data);
const sigValueHex = signature.sign();
console.log("Signature:", sigValueHex);

// Verify signature
const isValid = new jsrsasign.KJUR.crypto.Signature({alg: "SHA256withRSA"});
isValid.init(publicKey);
isValid.updateString(data);
const isValidSignature = isValid.verify(sigValueHex);
console.log("Signature Valid:", isValidSignature);
```

### Best Practices for Cryptography in JavaScript

1. **Use Well-Established Algorithms**: Always opt for widely accepted algorithms like AES for encryption and SHA-256 for hashing.

2. **Proper Key Management**: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys. Avoid hardcoding keys in your source code.

3. **Regularly Update Libraries**: Keep cryptographic libraries up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.

4. **Use Salts for Hashing**: Incorporate salts when hashing passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks.

5. **Test for Security**: Regularly test your cryptographic implementations for security flaws.

### Visualizing Cryptographic Processes
