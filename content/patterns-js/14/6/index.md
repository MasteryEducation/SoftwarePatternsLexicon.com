## 14.6 Input Validation and Sanitization

In the world of web development, ensuring the security and integrity of your application is paramount. One of the most critical aspects of this is input validation and sanitization. By properly validating and sanitizing user input, we can prevent a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including injection attacks, and ensure that our applications handle data safely and reliably.

### Understanding the Risks of Unvalidated Input

Unvalidated input is a significant security risk. Attackers can exploit this to inject malicious code, manipulate data, or even gain unauthorized access to systems. Common vulnerabilities that arise from unvalidated input include:

- **SQL Injection**: Attackers can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **LDAP Injection**: Similar to SQL injection, but targets LDAP queries.
- **Command Injection**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users.

These vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and damage to your application's reputation.

### Types of Validation

To mitigate these risks, we must implement robust validation mechanisms. Let's explore the different types of validation:

#### Client-Side vs. Server-Side Validation

- **Client-Side Validation**: Performed in the user's browser before data is sent to the server. It provides immediate feedback to users and reduces server load. However, it should never be relied upon as the sole validation mechanism, as it can be bypassed by attackers.

- **Server-Side Validation**: Conducted on the server after data is received. It is essential for ensuring data integrity and security, as it cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulations.

**Example of Client-Side Validation:**

```html
<form id="myForm">
  <input type="text" id="username" required minlength="3" maxlength="15">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

<script>
document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  const username = document.getElementById('username').value;
  if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(username)) {
    alert('Username must be alphanumeric.');
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});
</script>
```

**Example of Server-Side Validation:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
  if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(username)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid username.');
  }
  res.send('Username is valid.');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

#### Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting Input

- **Whitelisting**: Only allows specific, predefined input values. This is the preferred method as it is more secure and reduces the risk of unexpected input.

- **Blacklisting**: Blocks known malicious input patterns. This method is less secure as it requires constant updates to the list of blocked patterns.

**Example of Whitelisting:**

```javascript
function validateInput(input) {
  const allowedValues = ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'];
  if (!allowedValues.includes(input)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid input');
  }
}
```

**Example of Blacklisting:**

```javascript
function validateInput(input) {
  const forbiddenPatterns = [/script/i, /<.*>/];
  forbiddenPatterns.forEach(pattern => {
    if (pattern.test(input)) {
      throw new Error('Malicious input detected');
    }
  });
}
```

### Sanitization Methods

Sanitization involves cleaning or encoding input to remove or neutralize harmful characters. This is crucial for preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity.

#### Encoding Harmful Characters

Encoding converts potentially dangerous characters into a safe format that can be safely stored or displayed.

**Example of Encoding:**

```javascript
function sanitizeInput(input) {
  return input.replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
              .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
              .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
              .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
              .replace(/'/g, '&#x27;')
              .replace(/\//g, '&#x2F;');
}
```

#### Using Libraries and Frameworks

Several libraries and frameworks can assist with input validation and sanitization, making it easier to implement secure practices.

- **Validator.js**: A library for validating and sanitizing strings.
- **DOMPurify**: A library for sanitizing HTML and preventing XSS attacks.
- **Express Validator**: Middleware for validating and sanitizing input in Express applications.

**Example using Validator.js:**

```javascript
const validator = require('validator');

const input = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>';
const sanitizedInput = validator.escape(input);
console.log(sanitizedInput); // &lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;
```

### Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention

#### SQL Injection

SQL injection occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate a SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code. To prevent this, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Example of Preventing SQL Injection:**

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');
const connection = mysql.createConnection({ /* connection details */ });

const username = 'user';
const password = 'pass';

const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
connection.query(query, [username, password], (error, results) => {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log(results);
});
```

#### LDAP Injection

LDAP injection is similar to SQL injection but targets LDAP queries. To prevent this, use parameterized queries and escape special characters.

#### Command Injection

Command injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server. To prevent this, avoid using user input in shell commands and use libraries that provide safe alternatives.

**Example of Preventing Command Injection:**

```javascript
const { execFile } = require('child_process');

const userInput = 'safeInput';
execFile('ls', ['-lh', userInput], (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
});
```

### Visualizing Input Validation and Sanitization Process

To better understand the process of input validation and sanitization, let's visualize it using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Input] --> B{Client-Side Validation};
    B -->|Valid| C[Send to Server];
    B -->|Invalid| D[Show Error Message];
    C --> E{Server-Side Validation};
    E -->|Valid| F[Process Data];
    E -->|Invalid| G[Return Error];
    F --> H[Sanitize Data];
    H --> I[Store/Use Data];
```

**Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of input validation and sanitization. User input is first validated on the client-side. If valid, it is sent to the server for further validation. If the server-side validation is successful, the data is sanitized before being stored or used.
