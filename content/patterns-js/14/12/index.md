## 14.12 Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation

In the ever-evolving landscape of web security, Content Security Policy (CSP) stands out as a powerful tool to protect web applications from cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks. By specifying trusted content sources, CSP helps ensure that only safe and intended resources are loaded and executed by the browser. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of CSP, explore how it works, and provide practical guidance on implementing it effectively.

### What is Content Security Policy?

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps prevent a variety of attacks, including XSS, clickjacking, and other code injection attacks. It does so by allowing web developers to control which resources can be loaded and executed on their web pages. CSP is implemented by setting HTTP headers that instruct the browser on which resources are considered safe.

#### How CSP Works

CSP works by defining a set of rules, known as directives, that specify which types of content are allowed to be loaded and executed. These directives are communicated to the browser via HTTP headers or `<meta>` tags. When a browser encounters a CSP header, it evaluates the rules and blocks any content that does not comply with the policy.

### Setting CSP Headers

To implement CSP, you need to set the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header in your server configuration. Here is a basic example of a CSP header:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
```

In this example, the `default-src` directive allows content to be loaded only from the same origin (`'self'`). The `script-src` directive permits scripts to be loaded from the same origin and from `https://apis.example.com`. The `style-src` directive allows styles to be loaded from the same origin and permits inline styles (`'unsafe-inline'`).

### Key CSP Directives

CSP directives define the policy for different types of resources. Here are some of the most commonly used directives:

- **`default-src`**: Serves as a fallback for other resource types if they are not explicitly specified.
- **`script-src`**: Specifies valid sources for JavaScript.
- **`style-src`**: Defines valid sources for CSS styles.
- **`img-src`**: Specifies valid sources for images.
- **`connect-src`**: Defines valid endpoints for XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket, and EventSource connections.
- **`font-src`**: Specifies valid sources for fonts.
- **`object-src`**: Defines valid sources for `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements.
- **`media-src`**: Specifies valid sources for audio and video elements.
- **`frame-src`**: Defines valid sources for nested browsing contexts like `<iframe>`.

### Best Practices for Crafting a Secure CSP

Crafting a secure CSP requires careful consideration of your application's needs and potential security threats. Here are some best practices to follow:

1. **Start with a Strict Policy**: Begin with a restrictive policy and gradually relax it as needed. This approach helps identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities early.

2. **Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`**: These keywords allow inline scripts and styles, which can be exploited by attackers. Use nonce or hash-based approaches to allow specific inline content.

3. **Use Nonces or Hashes**: Instead of allowing all inline scripts, use nonces or hashes to permit specific inline scripts. This approach provides a more secure alternative to `unsafe-inline`.

4. **Regularly Review and Update CSP**: As your application evolves, so should your CSP. Regularly review and update your policy to address new features and potential security threats.

5. **Monitor CSP Violations**: Enable CSP reporting to monitor violations and identify potential security issues. Use the `report-uri` or `report-to` directives to specify endpoints for receiving violation reports.

### Tools and Browser Support for CSP

CSP is widely supported across modern browsers, making it a reliable security feature for web applications. Here are some tools and resources to help you implement and test CSP:

- **CSP Evaluator**: A tool by Google that evaluates your CSP and provides feedback on potential security issues. [CSP Evaluator](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/)

- **Report URI**: A service that collects CSP violation reports and provides insights into potential security threats. [Report URI](https://report-uri.com/)

- **Mozilla Observatory**: A tool that analyzes your website's security headers, including CSP, and provides recommendations for improvement. [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)

### Reporting Mechanisms and Monitoring CSP Violations

Monitoring CSP violations is crucial for maintaining a secure web application. CSP provides two directives for reporting violations:

- **`report-uri`**: Specifies a URI where the browser should send reports about policy violations.

- **`report-to`**: A newer directive that allows more flexible reporting, including grouping reports and specifying multiple endpoints.

Here is an example of a CSP header with reporting enabled:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; report-uri https://example.com/csp-report;
```

By monitoring CSP violations, you can identify and address potential security issues before they are exploited by attackers.

### Visualizing CSP Implementation

To better understand how CSP works, let's visualize the interaction between a web browser and a server with CSP implemented.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant Server

    Browser->>Server: Request Web Page
    Server-->>Browser: Send HTML with CSP Header
    Browser->>Browser: Parse HTML and CSP Header
    Browser->>Server: Request Resources (Scripts, Styles, etc.)
    alt Resource Allowed by CSP
        Server-->>Browser: Send Resource
        Browser->>Browser: Execute Resource
    else Resource Blocked by CSP
        Browser->>Browser: Block Resource
        Browser->>Server: Send CSP Violation Report
    end
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the process of a browser requesting a web page from a server with CSP implemented. The server sends the HTML along with the CSP header. The browser parses the HTML and CSP header, requests resources, and either executes or blocks them based on the CSP rules. If a resource is blocked, a CSP violation report is sent to the server.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with CSP, try implementing a basic CSP on your own web application. Start with a strict policy and gradually adjust it to meet your application's needs. Use tools like CSP Evaluator and Report URI to test and monitor your policy.
