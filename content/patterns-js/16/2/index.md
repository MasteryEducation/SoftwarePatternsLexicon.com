## 16.2 Metaprogramming Patterns

Metaprogramming is a powerful programming paradigm that allows developers to write programs that can manipulate other programs or themselves. In JavaScript and TypeScript, metaprogramming leverages the dynamic features of the languages to create flexible and dynamic solutions. This article delves into the key techniques of metaprogramming, including reflection, dynamic code execution, proxies, and decorators, and provides practical examples and best practices for their implementation.

### Understand the Concept

Metaprogramming involves writing code that can inspect, modify, or generate other code at runtime. This capability is particularly useful in dynamic languages like JavaScript and TypeScript, where runtime flexibility is a significant advantage.

#### Key Techniques

1. **Reflection:**
   - Reflection allows programs to inspect and modify their structure and behavior at runtime. This includes examining object properties, methods, and types.
   
2. **Dynamic Code Execution:**
   - This technique involves executing code represented as strings using functions like `eval()` or `new Function()`. While powerful, it should be used with caution due to potential security risks.
   
3. **Proxies:**
   - Proxies provide a way to intercept and redefine fundamental operations on objects, such as property access, assignment, and function invocation.
   
4. **Decorators (TypeScript):**
   - Decorators are a TypeScript feature that allows developers to add annotations and modify the behavior of classes and their members.

### Implementation Steps

#### Utilize Proxies

Proxies in JavaScript allow you to define custom behavior for fundamental operations on objects. This can be useful for access control, validation, or implementing lazy properties.

```javascript
const handler = {
  get: (target, property) => {
    console.log(`Getting ${property}`);
    return property in target ? target[property] : 'Property not found';
  },
  set: (target, property, value) => {
    console.log(`Setting ${property} to ${value}`);
    target[property] = value;
    return true;
  }
};

const proxy = new Proxy({}, handler);
proxy.name = 'JavaScript';
console.log(proxy.name); // Output: Getting name \n JavaScript
console.log(proxy.age);  // Output: Getting age \n Property not found
```

#### Apply Decorators

Decorators in TypeScript provide a way to augment or modify classes and their behavior. They can be applied to classes, methods, or properties.

```typescript
function Log(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${propertyKey} with arguments`, args);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class Calculator {
  @Log
  add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calculator = new Calculator();
calculator.add(2, 3); // Output: Calling add with arguments [2, 3]
```

#### Implement Reflection

Reflection in TypeScript can be achieved using metadata reflection APIs, which allow you to inspect types and metadata at runtime.

```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';

function ReflectMetadata(target: any, key: string) {
  const type = Reflect.getMetadata('design:type', target, key);
  console.log(`${key} type: ${type.name}`);
}

class Example {
  @ReflectMetadata
  public name: string;
}

const example = new Example();
```

#### Generate Code Dynamically

Dynamic code generation involves writing code that can create or modify other code structures during execution. This is often used in frameworks and libraries.

```javascript
function createFunction() {
  return new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
}

const add = createFunction();
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

### Code Examples

#### Validation System with Decorators

Create a validation system using decorators to check property values.

```typescript
function Validate(target: any, propertyKey: string) {
  let value: string;
  const getter = () => value;
  const setter = (newValue: string) => {
    if (!newValue) {
      throw new Error('Invalid value');
    }
    value = newValue;
  };
  Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {
    get: getter,
    set: setter,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true
  });
}

class User {
  @Validate
  public name: string;
}

const user = new User();
user.name = 'John'; // Works fine
// user.name = ''; // Throws error: Invalid value
```

#### Dynamic ORM

Implement a dynamic ORM that maps objects to database tables at runtime.

```typescript
class ORM {
  private data: Record<string, any> = {};

  set(table: string, key: string, value: any) {
    if (!this.data[table]) {
      this.data[table] = {};
    }
    this.data[table][key] = value;
  }

  get(table: string, key: string) {
    return this.data[table]?.[key];
  }
}

const orm = new ORM();
orm.set('users', '1', { name: 'Alice' });
console.log(orm.get('users', '1')); // Output: { name: 'Alice' }
```

### Use Cases

- **Building Frameworks or Libraries:** Metaprogramming is often used in frameworks and libraries that require flexible and dynamic features.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Implementing concerns like logging, caching, or authentication can benefit from metaprogramming techniques.

### Practice

Develop a custom testing framework that automatically discovers and runs test cases using metaprogramming techniques.

```typescript
function Test(target: any, propertyKey: string) {
  if (!target.constructor.tests) {
    target.constructor.tests = [];
  }
  target.constructor.tests.push(propertyKey);
}

class TestSuite {
  @Test
  test1() {
    console.log('Running test1');
  }

  @Test
  test2() {
    console.log('Running test2');
  }

  runTests() {
    for (const test of (this.constructor as any).tests) {
      this[test]();
    }
  }
}

const suite = new TestSuite();
suite.runTests(); // Output: Running test1 \n Running test2
```

### Considerations

- **Readability and Debugging:** Metaprogramming can make code harder to read and debug. Use it judiciously and document your code well.
- **Security Implications:** Be cautious of security risks, especially when using `eval()` or similar techniques. Always validate and sanitize inputs.

### Conclusion

Metaprogramming in JavaScript and TypeScript offers powerful tools for creating flexible and dynamic applications. By understanding and applying techniques like reflection, dynamic code execution, proxies, and decorators, developers can build robust solutions that adapt to changing requirements. However, it's crucial to balance the benefits of metaprogramming with considerations for code readability, maintainability, and security.
