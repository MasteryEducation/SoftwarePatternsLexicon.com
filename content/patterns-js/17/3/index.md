## 17.3 Working with Databases and ORMs

In modern web development, databases are the backbone of data storage and retrieval. JavaScript developers often interact with databases using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools, which provide a higher-level abstraction over raw database queries. This section will guide you through the essentials of working with databases in JavaScript, focusing on popular ORMs like Sequelize, TypeORM, and Mongoose.

### Understanding ORMs

**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm. ORMs map database tables to classes, rows to instances, and columns to attributes, making database interactions more intuitive and less error-prone.

#### Benefits of Using ORMs

- **Abstraction**: ORMs abstract the complexities of SQL queries, allowing developers to focus on business logic.
- **Productivity**: By using ORMs, developers can write less code and achieve more, speeding up development.
- **Maintainability**: Code written with ORMs is often more readable and easier to maintain.
- **Cross-Database Compatibility**: Many ORMs support multiple database systems, allowing for easier migration and integration.
- **Security**: ORMs help prevent SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries.

### Popular JavaScript ORMs

Let's explore some of the most popular ORMs used in JavaScript development:

#### Sequelize

[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is a promise-based Node.js ORM for SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It provides a robust set of features for managing database interactions.

#### TypeORM

[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) is an ORM that supports both SQL and NoSQL databases. It is written in TypeScript and provides excellent support for TypeScript features, making it a great choice for developers using TypeScript.

#### Mongoose

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.

### Defining Models and Relationships

ORMs allow you to define models that represent your database tables. Let's see how to define models using Sequelize, TypeORM, and Mongoose.

#### Sequelize Model Definition

```javascript
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: 'postgres'
});

const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  username: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  },
  password: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  }
});

(async () => {
  await sequelize.sync({ force: true });
  console.log("The table for the User model was just (re)created!");
})();
```

**Explanation**: In Sequelize, models are defined using the `define` method, where you specify the model name and its attributes. The `sync` method is used to create the table in the database.

#### TypeORM Model Definition

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, createConnection } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  username: string;

  @Column()
  password: string;
}

createConnection().then(async connection => {
  const userRepository = connection.getRepository(User);
  const user = new User();
  user.username = "JohnDoe";
  user.password = "securePassword";
  await userRepository.save(user);
  console.log("User has been saved.");
}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

**Explanation**: TypeORM uses decorators to define entities and their columns. The `createConnection` function establishes a connection to the database, and the `getRepository` method is used to interact with the database.

#### Mongoose Model Definition

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
    const user = new User({ username: 'JohnDoe', password: 'securePassword' });
    return user.save();
  })
  .then(() => console.log("User has been saved."))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**Explanation**: Mongoose uses schemas to define the structure of documents within a collection. The `model` method creates a model from the schema, which is then used to interact with the database.

### Managing Relationships

ORMs also provide mechanisms to define relationships between models, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

#### Sequelize Relationships

```javascript
const Post = sequelize.define('Post', {
  title: DataTypes.STRING,
  content: DataTypes.TEXT
});

User.hasMany(Post);
Post.belongsTo(User);

(async () => {
  await sequelize.sync({ force: true });
  console.log("Tables have been created.");
})();
```

**Explanation**: Sequelize uses methods like `hasMany` and `belongsTo` to define relationships between models.

#### TypeORM Relationships

```typescript
import { OneToMany, ManyToOne } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class Post {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  title: string;

  @Column()
  content: string;

  @ManyToOne(() => User, user => user.posts)
  user: User;
}

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  username: string;

  @Column()
  password: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Post, post => post.user)
  posts: Post[];
}
```

**Explanation**: TypeORM uses decorators like `OneToMany` and `ManyToOne` to define relationships between entities.

#### Mongoose Relationships

```javascript
const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String,
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
});

const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema);

User.findOne({ username: 'JohnDoe' }).then(user => {
  const post = new Post({ title: 'My First Post', content: 'Hello World!', user: user._id });
  return post.save();
}).then(() => console.log("Post has been saved."))
.catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**Explanation**: Mongoose uses references to other documents to define relationships. The `ref` option in the schema indicates the related model.

### Queries and Data Manipulation

ORMs provide a high-level API for querying and manipulating data.

#### Sequelize Queries

```javascript
User.findAll({
  where: {
    username: 'JohnDoe'
  },
  include: [Post]
}).then(users => {
  console.log(users);
});
```

**Explanation**: Sequelize's `findAll` method is used to retrieve data, with options to filter and include related models.

#### TypeORM Queries

```typescript
const userRepository = connection.getRepository(User);
userRepository.find({ where: { username: 'JohnDoe' }, relations: ["posts"] })
  .then(users => {
    console.log(users);
  });
```

**Explanation**: TypeORM's `find` method allows for querying with conditions and including related entities.

#### Mongoose Queries

```javascript
User.findOne({ username: 'JohnDoe' }).populate('posts').exec((err, user) => {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log(user);
});
```

**Explanation**: Mongoose's `findOne` method is used to query documents, with `populate` to include related documents.

### Migrations and Schema Synchronization

Managing database schema changes is crucial in application development. ORMs provide tools for handling migrations and schema synchronization.

#### Sequelize Migrations

Sequelize CLI can be used to create and run migrations.

```bash
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-users-table
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

**Explanation**: The `sequelize-cli` is used to generate migration files and apply them to the database.

#### TypeORM Migrations

TypeORM CLI provides commands for generating and running migrations.

```bash
typeorm migration:create -n CreateUsersTable
typeorm migration:run
```

**Explanation**: TypeORM's CLI is used to create migration files and execute them.

#### Mongoose Schema Synchronization

Mongoose does not have built-in migration tools, but you can use libraries like `migrate-mongoose` to manage schema changes.

### Best Practices for Database Access and Security

- **Use Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Limit Data Exposure**: Only expose necessary data to the client to minimize security risks.
- **Use Transactions**: For operations that require multiple steps, use transactions to ensure data integrity.
- **Regular Backups**: Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss.
- **Monitor Performance**: Use database monitoring tools to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

### Try It Yourself
