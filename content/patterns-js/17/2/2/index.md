## 17.2.2 Overuse of Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. While inheritance can be a powerful tool, its overuse can lead to deep and improper inheritance hierarchies, resulting in tightly coupled and fragile code. This section explores the pitfalls of overusing inheritance in JavaScript and TypeScript and provides solutions to mitigate these issues.

### Understand the Problem

Overusing inheritance often leads to several issues:

- **Tight Coupling:** Classes become tightly coupled, making changes difficult and error-prone.
- **Fragile Base Class Problem:** Changes in a base class can inadvertently affect all derived classes.
- **Inflexibility:** Inheritance hierarchies can be rigid, making it challenging to adapt to new requirements.
- **Complexity:** Deep inheritance chains can make the codebase complex and difficult to understand.

#### Example of Overuse of Inheritance

Consider a scenario where we have a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles:

```typescript
class Vehicle {
    startEngine() {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    openTrunk() {
        console.log("Trunk opened");
    }
}

class SportsCar extends Car {
    activateTurbo() {
        console.log("Turbo activated");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SportsCar` class inherits from `Car`, which in turn inherits from `Vehicle`. While this might seem logical, adding more vehicle types can quickly lead to a complex and unmanageable hierarchy.

### Solution: Favor Composition Over Inheritance

To address the issues associated with overusing inheritance, consider using composition over inheritance. Composition involves building classes by combining simple, reusable components.

#### Implementing Composition

Let's refactor the vehicle example using composition:

```typescript
class Engine {
    start() {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

class Trunk {
    open() {
        console.log("Trunk opened");
    }
}

class Turbo {
    activate() {
        console.log("Turbo activated");
    }
}

class SportsCar {
    private engine: Engine;
    private trunk: Trunk;
    private turbo: Turbo;

    constructor() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
        this.trunk = new Trunk();
        this.turbo = new Turbo();
    }

    startEngine() {
        this.engine.start();
    }

    openTrunk() {
        this.trunk.open();
    }

    activateTurbo() {
        this.turbo.activate();
    }
}
```

In this refactored version, `SportsCar` is composed of `Engine`, `Trunk`, and `Turbo` components, promoting flexibility and reusability.

### Implement Interfaces or Mixins

Another approach to avoid overusing inheritance is to use interfaces or mixins to share behavior across classes.

#### Using Interfaces

Interfaces can define a contract that classes must adhere to, promoting loose coupling.

```typescript
interface Engine {
    start(): void;
}

interface Trunk {
    open(): void;
}

class BasicEngine implements Engine {
    start() {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

class BasicTrunk implements Trunk {
    open() {
        console.log("Trunk opened");
    }
}

class Car {
    private engine: Engine;
    private trunk: Trunk;

    constructor(engine: Engine, trunk: Trunk) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.trunk = trunk;
    }

    startEngine() {
        this.engine.start();
    }

    openTrunk() {
        this.trunk.open();
    }
}
```

#### Using Mixins

Mixins allow you to add functionality to classes without using inheritance.

```typescript
type Constructor<T = {}> = new (...args: any[]) => T;

function TurboMixin<TBase extends Constructor>(Base: TBase) {
    return class extends Base {
        activateTurbo() {
            console.log("Turbo activated");
        }
    };
}

class BasicCar {
    startEngine() {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

const SportsCarWithTurbo = TurboMixin(BasicCar);

const sportsCar = new SportsCarWithTurbo();
sportsCar.startEngine();
sportsCar.activateTurbo();
```

### Practice: Replace Inheritance with Composition

When you encounter a class hierarchy experiencing issues due to overuse of inheritance, consider refactoring it to use composition. This involves identifying common behaviors and encapsulating them into separate classes or modules.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages of Composition

- **Flexibility:** Easily adapt to changing requirements by swapping components.
- **Reusability:** Reuse components across different classes.
- **Loose Coupling:** Reduce dependencies between classes, making the system more robust.

#### Disadvantages of Composition

- **Complexity:** May introduce complexity if not managed properly.
- **Overhead:** Can lead to more boilerplate code compared to inheritance.

### Best Practices

- **Evaluate the Need for Inheritance:** Use inheritance only when there is a clear "is-a" relationship.
- **Encapsulate Behavior:** Use composition to encapsulate behavior and promote reusability.
- **Leverage Interfaces and Mixins:** Use interfaces and mixins to share behavior without creating deep hierarchies.

### Conclusion

Overusing inheritance can lead to tightly coupled and fragile code. By favoring composition over inheritance, you can create more flexible, maintainable, and robust systems. Implementing interfaces and mixins further enhances code reusability and adaptability. Understanding when to use inheritance and when to opt for composition is crucial for effective software design.
