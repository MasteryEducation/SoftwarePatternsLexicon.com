## 27.9 Dependency Injection with TypeScript

In modern software development, creating applications that are both modular and testable is crucial. Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that helps achieve these goals by promoting loose coupling between components. In this section, we will explore how TypeScript supports dependency injection patterns, the benefits it brings to code modularity and unit testing, and how frameworks like InversifyJS can facilitate DI in TypeScript applications.

### Understanding Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. Instead of a class creating its dependencies, they are provided to the class from an external source. This approach decouples the class from its dependencies, making it easier to manage and test.

#### Key Concepts of Dependency Injection

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** A principle where the control of object creation and management is transferred from the class itself to an external entity.
- **Dependency:** An object that a class requires to function correctly.
- **Injector:** A component responsible for providing dependencies to a class.

### Benefits of Dependency Injection

1. **Loose Coupling:** Classes are not tightly bound to their dependencies, allowing for easier changes and maintenance.
2. **Improved Testability:** Dependencies can be easily mocked or stubbed, facilitating unit testing.
3. **Enhanced Modularity:** Components can be developed and maintained independently.
4. **Reusability:** Dependencies can be reused across different parts of the application.

### Implementing Dependency Injection in TypeScript

TypeScript, with its strong typing and support for decorators, provides a robust platform for implementing dependency injection. Let's explore how to implement DI in TypeScript with examples.

#### Basic Dependency Injection Example

Consider a simple example where a `Car` class depends on an `Engine` class.

```typescript
// Engine.ts
export class Engine {
    start() {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

// Car.ts
import { Engine } from './Engine';

export class Car {
    private engine: Engine;

    constructor(engine: Engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    start() {
        this.engine.start();
        console.log("Car started");
    }
}

// main.ts
import { Car } from './Car';
import { Engine } from './Engine';

const engine = new Engine();
const car = new Car(engine);
car.start();
```

In this example, the `Car` class receives an `Engine` instance through its constructor, demonstrating constructor injection.

### Using Decorators and Metadata for Injection

TypeScript decorators provide a powerful way to implement dependency injection by adding metadata to classes and methods. Decorators can be used to annotate dependencies, making it easier for an injector to provide them.

#### Example with Decorators

```typescript
// decorators.ts
function Injectable(target: Function) {
    // Decorator logic to mark a class as injectable
}

function Inject(target: Object, propertyKey: string | symbol, parameterIndex: number) {
    // Decorator logic to specify a dependency
}

// Engine.ts
@Injectable
export class Engine {
    start() {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

// Car.ts
import { Engine } from './Engine';
import { Inject } from './decorators';

@Injectable
export class Car {
    private engine: Engine;

    constructor(@Inject engine: Engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    start() {
        this.engine.start();
        console.log("Car started");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Injectable` decorator marks classes as injectable, and the `Inject` decorator specifies dependencies.

### Introducing InversifyJS

InversifyJS is a powerful and flexible inversion of control container for TypeScript and JavaScript applications. It leverages TypeScript's decorators and metadata to provide a seamless DI experience.

#### Setting Up InversifyJS

To use InversifyJS, you need to install it via npm:

```bash
npm install inversify reflect-metadata --save
```

Ensure that `reflect-metadata` is imported at the entry point of your application:

```typescript
import "reflect-metadata";
```

#### Example with InversifyJS

```typescript
// types.ts
const TYPES = {
    Engine: Symbol.for("Engine"),
    Car: Symbol.for("Car")
};

// Engine.ts
import { injectable } from "inversify";

@injectable()
export class Engine {
    start() {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

// Car.ts
import { inject, injectable } from "inversify";
import { Engine } from './Engine';
import { TYPES } from './types';

@injectable()
export class Car {
    private engine: Engine;

    constructor(@inject(TYPES.Engine) engine: Engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    start() {
        this.engine.start();
        console.log("Car started");
    }
}

// inversify.config.ts
import { Container } from "inversify";
import { TYPES } from './types';
import { Engine } from './Engine';
import { Car } from './Car';

const container = new Container();
container.bind<Engine>(TYPES.Engine).to(Engine);
container.bind<Car>(TYPES.Car).to(Car);

export { container };

// main.ts
import { container } from './inversify.config';
import { Car } from './Car';
import { TYPES } from './types';

const car = container.get<Car>(TYPES.Car);
car.start();
```

In this example, InversifyJS is used to manage dependencies. The `Container` is configured to bind interfaces to their implementations, and the `@injectable` and `@inject` decorators are used to annotate classes and their dependencies.

### Benefits of Using InversifyJS

1. **Type Safety:** Leverages TypeScript's type system to ensure dependencies are correctly injected.
2. **Scalability:** Easily manage complex dependency graphs in large applications.
3. **Flexibility:** Supports various DI patterns, including constructor injection, property injection, and method injection.

### Visualizing Dependency Injection

To better understand how dependency injection works, let's visualize the process using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Engine {
        +start()
    }
    class Car {
        -Engine engine
        +Car(Engine engine)
        +start()
    }
    Car --> Engine : uses
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Car` and `Engine` classes, where `Car` depends on `Engine`.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by modifying the dependencies. For instance, create a `TurboEngine` class and inject it into the `Car` class instead of the regular `Engine`. Observe how the DI pattern allows for easy swapping of dependencies without modifying the `Car` class.
