## 27.5 Structural Patterns with Strong Typing

In this section, we will delve into how TypeScript's robust type system enhances the implementation of structural design patterns. Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. We'll focus on three key patterns: Adapter, Decorator, and Proxy. These patterns are commonly used in software design to create flexible and reusable code structures. By leveraging TypeScript's type safety and interfaces, we can significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of our code.

### Understanding Structural Patterns

Structural patterns define how objects and classes can be composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system does not need to be rewritten. Let's explore how TypeScript can be used to implement these patterns effectively.

### Adapter Pattern

**Intent**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. The Adapter pattern allows classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

**Key Participants**:
- **Target**: Defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.
- **Adapter**: Adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.
- **Adaptee**: Defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
- **Client**: Collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.

#### TypeScript Implementation

In TypeScript, we can use interfaces to define the expected interface and create an adapter class that implements this interface.

```typescript
// Target interface
interface ITarget {
  request(): string;
}

// Adaptee class with a different interface
class Adaptee {
  specificRequest(): string {
    return "Adaptee's specific request";
  }
}

// Adapter class
class Adapter implements ITarget {
  private adaptee: Adaptee;

  constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
    this.adaptee = adaptee;
  }

  public request(): string {
    return `Adapter: (TRANSLATED) ${this.adaptee.specificRequest()}`;
  }
}

// Client code
function clientCode(target: ITarget) {
  console.log(target.request());
}

const adaptee = new Adaptee();
const adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
clientCode(adapter);
```

**Explanation**: In this example, the `Adapter` class implements the `ITarget` interface and translates the `specificRequest` of the `Adaptee` into a `request` that the `Client` can use. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating third-party libraries or legacy code.

#### Benefits of TypeScript

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the adapter correctly implements the target interface.
- **Interfaces**: Clearly define the expected behavior, making the code more understandable and maintainable.
- **Advanced Types**: Allow for more flexible and reusable adapter implementations.

### Decorator Pattern

**Intent**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Key Participants**:
- **Component**: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
- **ConcreteComponent**: Defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
- **Decorator**: Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.
- **ConcreteDecorator**: Adds responsibilities to the component.

#### TypeScript Implementation

TypeScript's class and interface features make it easy to implement the Decorator pattern.

```typescript
// Component interface
interface Coffee {
  cost(): number;
  description(): string;
}

// ConcreteComponent
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
  cost(): number {
    return 5;
  }

  description(): string {
    return "Simple coffee";
  }
}

// Decorator
class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
  protected coffee: Coffee;

  constructor(coffee: Coffee) {
    this.coffee = coffee;
  }

  cost(): number {
    return this.coffee.cost();
  }

  description(): string {
    return this.coffee.description();
  }
}

// ConcreteDecorator
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
  cost(): number {
    return super.cost() + 1;
  }

  description(): string {
    return `${super.description()}, milk`;
  }
}

// Client code
const myCoffee = new MilkDecorator(new SimpleCoffee());
console.log(`${myCoffee.description()} costs $${myCoffee.cost()}`);
```

**Explanation**: The `CoffeeDecorator` class implements the `Coffee` interface and holds a reference to a `Coffee` object. The `MilkDecorator` extends `CoffeeDecorator` to add milk to the coffee, demonstrating how decorators can be stacked to add multiple functionalities.

#### Benefits of TypeScript

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that decorators conform to the component interface.
- **Reusability**: Decorators can be easily reused and combined in different configurations.
- **Flexibility**: New decorators can be added without modifying existing code.

### Proxy Pattern

**Intent**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

**Key Participants**:
- **Subject**: Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
- **RealSubject**: Defines the real object that the proxy represents.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to the RealSubject and may be responsible for creating and managing it.

#### TypeScript Implementation

TypeScript's interfaces and classes make it straightforward to implement the Proxy pattern.

```typescript
// Subject interface
interface Image {
  display(): void;
}

// RealSubject
class RealImage implements Image {
  private filename: string;

  constructor(filename: string) {
    this.filename = filename;
    this.loadFromDisk();
  }

  private loadFromDisk(): void {
    console.log(`Loading ${this.filename}`);
  }

  display(): void {
    console.log(`Displaying ${this.filename}`);
  }
}

// Proxy
class ProxyImage implements Image {
  private realImage: RealImage | null = null;
  private filename: string;

  constructor(filename: string) {
    this.filename = filename;
  }

  display(): void {
    if (this.realImage === null) {
      this.realImage = new RealImage(this.filename);
    }
    this.realImage.display();
  }
}

// Client code
const image = new ProxyImage("test.jpg");
image.display(); // Loading test.jpg
image.display(); // Displaying test.jpg
```

**Explanation**: The `ProxyImage` class implements the `Image` interface and controls access to the `RealImage`. It delays the creation of the `RealImage` until it is needed, demonstrating lazy initialization.

#### Benefits of TypeScript

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the proxy and real subject conform to the same interface.
- **Encapsulation**: Hides the complexity of the real subject from the client.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Delays the creation of expensive objects until they are needed.

### Advanced TypeScript Features

TypeScript offers advanced types that can further enhance the implementation of structural patterns:

- **Union and Intersection Types**: Allow for more flexible type definitions, enabling the combination of multiple types.
- **Mapped Types**: Provide a way to create new types based on existing ones, useful for creating variations of patterns.
- **Conditional Types**: Enable type definitions that depend on conditions, allowing for more dynamic and adaptable patterns.

### Visualizing Structural Patterns

To better understand how these patterns work, let's visualize the relationships between the components using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Adapter Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ITarget {
        +request() string
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request() string
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest() string
    }
    ITarget <|.. Adapter
    Adapter --> Adaptee
```

**Caption**: This diagram shows how the `Adapter` class implements the `ITarget` interface and interacts with the `Adaptee` class.

#### Decorator Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Coffee {
        +cost() int
        +description() string
    }
    class SimpleCoffee {
        +cost() int
        +description() string
    }
    class CoffeeDecorator {
        +cost() int
        +description() string
    }
    class MilkDecorator {
        +cost() int
        +description() string
    }
    Coffee <|.. SimpleCoffee
    Coffee <|.. CoffeeDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator <|-- MilkDecorator
    CoffeeDecorator --> Coffee
```

**Caption**: This diagram illustrates how decorators extend the functionality of the `SimpleCoffee` by implementing the `Coffee` interface.

#### Proxy Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Image {
        +display() void
    }
    class RealImage {
        +display() void
        -loadFromDisk() void
    }
    class ProxyImage {
        +display() void
    }
    Image <|.. RealImage
    Image <|.. ProxyImage
    ProxyImage --> RealImage
```

**Caption**: This diagram depicts the `ProxyImage` controlling access to the `RealImage`, both implementing the `Image` interface.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by making the following modifications:
