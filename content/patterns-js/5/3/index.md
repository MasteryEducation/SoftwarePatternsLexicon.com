## 5.3 Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create or when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects to be created.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Factory Method Pattern is to define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses, promoting loose coupling and enhancing flexibility in code design.

### Key Participants

- **Product**: Defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
- **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the Product interface.
- **Creator**: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. It may also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object.
- **ConcreteCreator**: Overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.

### Applicability

- When a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
- When classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore how to implement the Factory Method Pattern in JavaScript with a practical example.

```javascript
// Product Interface
class Car {
  constructor() {
    if (this.constructor === Car) {
      throw new Error("Cannot instantiate abstract class Car");
    }
  }

  drive() {
    throw new Error("Abstract method 'drive' must be implemented");
  }
}

// ConcreteProduct
class Sedan extends Car {
  drive() {
    console.log("Driving a sedan...");
  }
}

class SUV extends Car {
  drive() {
    console.log("Driving an SUV...");
  }
}

// Creator
class CarFactory {
  createCar(type) {
    throw new Error("Abstract method 'createCar' must be implemented");
  }
}

// ConcreteCreator
class ConcreteCarFactory extends CarFactory {
  createCar(type) {
    switch (type) {
      case "sedan":
        return new Sedan();
      case "suv":
        return new SUV();
      default:
        throw new Error("Unknown car type");
    }
  }
}

// Client code
const factory = new ConcreteCarFactory();
const sedan = factory.createCar("sedan");
sedan.drive(); // Output: Driving a sedan...

const suv = factory.createCar("suv");
suv.drive(); // Output: Driving an SUV...
```

### Design Considerations

- **Decoupling**: The Factory Method Pattern decouples the client code from the concrete classes it needs to instantiate, promoting flexibility and scalability.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: The pattern supports code that is open for extension but closed for modification. New product types can be added without altering existing code.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: By delegating the responsibility of object creation to factory methods, classes adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.

### JavaScript Unique Features

JavaScript's prototypal inheritance and dynamic typing make it particularly well-suited for implementing the Factory Method Pattern. JavaScript allows for flexible object creation and manipulation, which can be leveraged to create dynamic and adaptable factory methods.

### Differences and Similarities

The Factory Method Pattern is often confused with the Abstract Factory Pattern. While both patterns deal with object creation, the Factory Method Pattern focuses on creating a single product, whereas the Abstract Factory Pattern deals with creating families of related or dependent objects.

### Real-World Scenarios

- **UI Components**: In a UI library, different types of buttons, text fields, and other components can be created using factory methods, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- **Logging Frameworks**: A logging framework might use factory methods to create different types of loggers (e.g., console, file, remote) based on configuration.
- **Game Development**: In game development, factory methods can be used to create different types of game objects (e.g., enemies, power-ups) dynamically during gameplay.

### Visualizing the Factory Method Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Car {
        <<interface>>
        +drive()
    }
    class Sedan {
        +drive()
    }
    class SUV {
        +drive()
    }
    class CarFactory {
        <<abstract>>
        +createCar(type)
    }
    class ConcreteCarFactory {
        +createCar(type)
    }
    Car <|-- Sedan
    Car <|-- SUV
    CarFactory <|-- ConcreteCarFactory
    ConcreteCarFactory o-- Car
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the Factory Method Pattern. The `Car` interface defines the `drive` method. `Sedan` and `SUV` are concrete implementations of `Car`. `CarFactory` is an abstract class with a `createCar` method, and `ConcreteCarFactory` implements this method to create instances of `Sedan` or `SUV`.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code by adding new car types, such as `Truck` or `Convertible`. Implement these new classes and modify the `ConcreteCarFactory` to handle these types. This exercise will help reinforce your understanding of the Factory Method Pattern and its flexibility.
