## 7.1 Strategy Pattern with Dynamic Functions

### Introduction to the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. This pattern promotes flexibility and reusability by encapsulating each algorithm within a separate object or function. By doing so, it allows for the dynamic swapping of strategies without altering the client code that uses them. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple algorithms can be applied to a problem, and the choice of algorithm might depend on runtime conditions.

### Intent of the Strategy Pattern

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. By decoupling the algorithm from the client, the Strategy Pattern provides a way to configure a class with one of many behaviors.

### Dynamic Strategy Selection in JavaScript

JavaScript, with its first-class functions and dynamic typing, is particularly well-suited for implementing the Strategy Pattern. Strategies can be represented as functions or classes, and they can be swapped dynamically at runtime. This flexibility allows developers to write more maintainable and adaptable code.

#### Implementing the Strategy Pattern with Functions

Let's explore how to implement the Strategy Pattern using functions in JavaScript. We'll start with a simple example involving a payment processing system that can handle different payment methods.

```javascript
// Define strategy functions
function creditCardPayment(amount) {
    console.log(`Processing credit card payment of $${amount}`);
}

function paypalPayment(amount) {
    console.log(`Processing PayPal payment of $${amount}`);
}

function bitcoinPayment(amount) {
    console.log(`Processing Bitcoin payment of $${amount}`);
}

// Context that uses the strategy
class PaymentProcessor {
    constructor(strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    setStrategy(strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    processPayment(amount) {
        this.strategy(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
const paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(creditCardPayment);
paymentProcessor.processPayment(100); // Processing credit card payment of $100

paymentProcessor.setStrategy(paypalPayment);
paymentProcessor.processPayment(200); // Processing PayPal payment of $200

paymentProcessor.setStrategy(bitcoinPayment);
paymentProcessor.processPayment(300); // Processing Bitcoin payment of $300
```

In this example, we define three different payment strategies as functions. The `PaymentProcessor` class acts as the context that uses these strategies. We can dynamically change the payment strategy by calling the `setStrategy` method.

#### Implementing the Strategy Pattern with Classes

Alternatively, we can implement the Strategy Pattern using classes. This approach is beneficial when strategies require more complex logic or state.

```javascript
// Define strategy classes
class CreditCardPayment {
    process(amount) {
        console.log(`Processing credit card payment of $${amount}`);
    }
}

class PayPalPayment {
    process(amount) {
        console.log(`Processing PayPal payment of $${amount}`);
    }
}

class BitcoinPayment {
    process(amount) {
        console.log(`Processing Bitcoin payment of $${amount}`);
    }
}

// Context that uses the strategy
class PaymentProcessor {
    constructor(strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    setStrategy(strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    processPayment(amount) {
        this.strategy.process(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
const paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(new CreditCardPayment());
paymentProcessor.processPayment(100); // Processing credit card payment of $100

paymentProcessor.setStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
paymentProcessor.processPayment(200); // Processing PayPal payment of $200

paymentProcessor.setStrategy(new BitcoinPayment());
paymentProcessor.processPayment(300); // Processing Bitcoin payment of $300
```

In this version, each strategy is encapsulated within a class that implements a `process` method. The `PaymentProcessor` class interacts with these strategy classes in the same way as before.

### Use Cases for the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is versatile and can be applied to various scenarios. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement different sorting strategies (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) and select the appropriate one based on the dataset size or characteristics.

2. **Input Validation**: Use different validation strategies for form inputs, allowing for flexible validation rules that can be changed at runtime.

3. **Payment Processing**: As demonstrated in the examples, handle multiple payment methods by encapsulating each method's logic in a separate strategy.

4. **Compression Algorithms**: Choose between different compression strategies based on file type or size.

5. **Data Transformation**: Apply different data transformation strategies to datasets, such as filtering, mapping, or reducing.

### Importance of a Consistent Interface

For the Strategy Pattern to work effectively, all strategies must adhere to a consistent interface. This ensures that the context can interact with any strategy interchangeably without needing to know the details of each strategy's implementation. In JavaScript, this can be achieved by ensuring that all strategy functions or classes implement the same method signature.

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern offers several benefits:

- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between different algorithms at runtime without modifying the client code.
- **Reusability**: Encapsulate algorithms in separate objects or functions, promoting code reuse.
- **Maintainability**: Reduce complex conditional statements by delegating algorithm selection to the strategy pattern.
- **Scalability**: Add new strategies without altering existing code, making it easier to extend functionality.

### Reducing Conditional Statements

One of the key advantages of the Strategy Pattern is its ability to reduce conditional statements in your code. Instead of using `if...else` or `switch` statements to select an algorithm, you can delegate this responsibility to the strategy pattern. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

### JavaScript Unique Features

JavaScript's dynamic nature and first-class functions make it particularly well-suited for implementing the Strategy Pattern. The ability to pass functions as arguments and assign them to variables allows for a flexible and concise implementation of strategies.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

The Strategy Pattern is often compared to the State Pattern. While both patterns involve changing behavior at runtime, the Strategy Pattern focuses on selecting algorithms, whereas the State Pattern deals with changing an object's state. Additionally, the Strategy Pattern is more about encapsulating algorithms, while the State Pattern is about managing state transitions.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

To better understand the Strategy Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the context and strategies using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentProcessor {
        -strategy
        +setStrategy(strategy)
        +processPayment(amount)
    }

    class Strategy {
        <<interface>>
        +process(amount)
    }

    class CreditCardPayment {
        +process(amount)
    }

    class PayPalPayment {
        +process(amount)
    }

    class BitcoinPayment {
        +process(amount)
    }

    PaymentProcessor --> Strategy
    Strategy <|-- CreditCardPayment
    Strategy <|-- PayPalPayment
    Strategy <|-- BitcoinPayment
```

In this diagram, the `PaymentProcessor` class depends on the `Strategy` interface, which is implemented by the `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, and `BitcoinPayment` classes. This setup allows the `PaymentProcessor` to use any of these strategies interchangeably.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Strategy Pattern, try modifying the code examples to include additional payment methods or different types of algorithms. Experiment with both function-based and class-based implementations to see which approach works best for your use case.
