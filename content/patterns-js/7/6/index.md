## 7.6 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles it. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects might be capable of handling a request, but the specific handler is not known in advance. By decoupling the sender of a request from its receiver, the Chain of Responsibility Pattern enhances flexibility and maintainability in software design.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern is to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by allowing more than one object to handle the request. The request is passed along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it.

### Key Participants

- **Handler**: Defines an interface for handling requests and optionally implements the successor link.
- **ConcreteHandler**: Handles requests it is responsible for and forwards requests it does not handle to the next handler.
- **Client**: Initiates the request to a ConcreteHandler object on the chain.

### Applicability

Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern when:

- More than one object can handle a request, and the handler is not known in advance.
- You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
- The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a simple implementation of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern in JavaScript using function chains:

```javascript
// Define a generic handler function
function createHandler(name, nextHandler) {
    return function(request) {
        if (canHandleRequest(request)) {
            console.log(`${name} handled the request.`);
        } else if (nextHandler) {
            nextHandler(request);
        } else {
            console.log(`No handler could process the request.`);
        }
    };
}

// Example condition to determine if the handler can process the request
function canHandleRequest(request) {
    // Logic to determine if the request can be handled
    return request === "specificRequest";
}

// Create handlers
const handler1 = createHandler("Handler1", null);
const handler2 = createHandler("Handler2", handler1);
const handler3 = createHandler("Handler3", handler2);

// Start the chain
handler3("specificRequest"); // Output: "Handler3 handled the request."
handler3("anotherRequest");  // Output: "No handler could process the request."
```

### Use Cases

#### Event Bubbling in the DOM

In the Document Object Model (DOM), event bubbling is a natural example of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern. When an event occurs, it starts from the target element and bubbles up through its ancestors, giving each a chance to handle the event.

#### Middleware in Express.js

Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework, uses middleware functions that process requests in a chain. Each middleware function can decide to pass control to the next middleware or terminate the request-response cycle.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware functions
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware 1');
    next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware 2');
    next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

#### Handling Support Tickets

In a customer support system, a support ticket might be passed through various levels of support staff, each with the ability to handle the ticket or escalate it to the next level.

### Adding, Removing, or Reordering Handlers

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is flexible, allowing handlers to be added, removed, or reordered dynamically. This flexibility is achieved by maintaining references to the next handler in the chain.

```javascript
// Dynamically add a new handler
const handler4 = createHandler("Handler4", handler3);

// Remove a handler by bypassing it
const handler5 = createHandler("Handler5", handler1);

// Reorder handlers by changing the chain
const handler6 = createHandler("Handler6", handler4);
```

### Benefits of Decoupling

- **Flexibility**: The pattern allows you to change the chain of handlers dynamically, making it easy to add, remove, or reorder handlers.
- **Decoupling**: By separating the sender and receiver, the pattern reduces dependencies and enhances maintainability.
- **Responsibility Segregation**: Each handler in the chain has a single responsibility, promoting cleaner and more modular code.

### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: The pattern may introduce performance overhead due to the traversal of the chain.
- **Complexity**: A long chain of handlers can become difficult to manage and debug.
- **Responsibility**: Ensure that each handler has a clear and distinct responsibility to avoid confusion.

### JavaScript Unique Features

JavaScript's first-class functions and closures make it particularly well-suited for implementing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern. Functions can be easily passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in variables, allowing for flexible and dynamic handler chains.

### Differences and Similarities

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both involve a chain of objects, the Decorator Pattern focuses on adding behavior to objects, whereas the Chain of Responsibility Pattern focuses on passing requests along a chain until one handles it.

### Visualizing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of a request through a chain of handlers:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client] --> B[Handler1];
    B --> C[Handler2];
    C --> D[Handler3];
    D --> E[Handler4];
    E --> F[Request Handled];
    E --> G[No Handler Found];
```

**Diagram Description**: The diagram shows a client sending a request to a chain of handlers. Each handler has the opportunity to process the request or pass it to the next handler. If no handler processes the request, it results in "No Handler Found."

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples by:

- Adding new handlers to the chain.
- Changing the conditions under which handlers process requests.
- Reordering the handlers to see how it affects the outcome.
