## 9. TypeScript Specific Patterns
### 9.2 Conditional Types

Conditional types in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows developers to create types based on conditions. This capability is akin to conditional statements in programming, enabling more dynamic and flexible type definitions. In this article, we will delve into the concept of conditional types, explore their implementation, and discuss practical use cases and best practices.

### Understand the Concept

Conditional types in TypeScript are defined using the syntax `T extends U ? X : Y`. This means that if type `T` extends type `U`, then type `X` is used; otherwise, type `Y` is used. This mechanism allows for creating types that can adapt based on the relationships between other types.

#### Example of Conditional Type Syntax

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "Yes" : "No";
```

In this example, `IsString` is a conditional type that evaluates to `"Yes"` if `T` is a `string`, and `"No"` otherwise.

### Implementation Steps

#### Define Conditional Types

Conditional types are defined by specifying a condition and the resulting types based on whether the condition is true or false. This is particularly useful for creating utility types that can adapt based on the types they are given.

#### Use `infer` Keyword

The `infer` keyword is used within conditional types to infer a type variable. This is particularly useful for extracting types from complex structures.

```typescript
type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any;
```

In this example, `ReturnType` is a utility type that extracts the return type of a function. If `T` is a function type, `R` is inferred as the return type of that function.

### Code Examples

#### Extracting Return Type of a Function

```typescript
type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any;

function exampleFunction(): number {
  return 42;
}

type ExampleReturnType = ReturnType<typeof exampleFunction>; // number
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use a conditional type to extract the return type of a function.

#### Making Properties Optional

```typescript
type OptionalIfExtends<T, U> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends U ? T[K] | undefined : T[K];
};

interface Example {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
}

type ExampleWithOptionalStrings = OptionalIfExtends<Example, string>;
// { name?: string; age: number; isActive: boolean; }
```

This example shows how to create a type that makes properties optional if they extend a certain type.

### Use Cases

#### Building Utility Types

Conditional types are instrumental in building utility types that can adapt based on the input types. This is useful for creating flexible libraries and APIs.

#### Creating Flexible APIs

By using conditional types, APIs can adjust their type behaviors based on the types of the inputs they receive, making them more robust and adaptable.

### Practice

#### Extracting Element Type of an Array or Tuple

```typescript
type ElementType<T> = T extends (infer U)[] ? U : T;

type StringArray = string[];
type NumberTuple = [number, number];

type StringElement = ElementType<StringArray>; // string
type NumberElement = ElementType<NumberTuple>; // number
```

This practice example demonstrates how to define a type that extracts the element type of an array or tuple.

### Considerations

While conditional types are powerful, they can introduce complexity into your codebase. It's important to keep conditional types understandable and maintainable. They are particularly useful for advanced type transformations and metaprogramming, but should be used judiciously to avoid overcomplicating your type definitions.

### Best Practices

- **Keep It Simple:** Avoid overly complex conditional types that are difficult to understand.
- **Document Your Types:** Provide clear documentation and comments for complex conditional types to aid understanding.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure that your conditional types behave as expected by writing comprehensive tests.

### Conclusion

Conditional types in TypeScript provide a powerful tool for creating flexible and adaptable type definitions. By understanding how to implement and use them effectively, you can enhance the robustness and flexibility of your TypeScript code. Remember to balance the power of conditional types with the need for maintainable and understandable code.

## Quiz Time!

### What is the primary purpose of conditional types in TypeScript?

- [x] To create types that depend on a condition
- [ ] To define constant types
- [ ] To enforce strict type checking
- [ ] To simplify function syntax

> **Explanation:** Conditional types allow the definition of types that depend on a condition, using the syntax `T extends U ? X : Y`.

### Which keyword is used to infer types within conditional types?

- [ ] extend
- [x] infer
- [ ] typeof
- [ ] as

> **Explanation:** The `infer` keyword is used within conditional types to infer a type variable.

### What does the following conditional type do? `type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any;`

- [x] Extracts the return type of a function
- [ ] Extracts the argument types of a function
- [ ] Extracts the properties of an object
- [ ] Extracts the element type of an array

> **Explanation:** This conditional type extracts the return type of a function by using the `infer` keyword.

### How can conditional types be useful in creating flexible APIs?

- [x] By adjusting type behaviors based on input types
- [ ] By enforcing strict type constraints
- [ ] By simplifying code syntax
- [ ] By reducing the need for documentation

> **Explanation:** Conditional types allow APIs to adjust their type behaviors based on the types of the inputs they receive, making them more robust and adaptable.

### What is a potential drawback of using conditional types?

- [ ] They are not supported in TypeScript
- [ ] They simplify code too much
- [x] They can introduce complexity
- [ ] They are too slow to compile

> **Explanation:** Conditional types can introduce complexity into your codebase, so it's important to keep them understandable and maintainable.

### What does the `OptionalIfExtends` type do in the provided example?

- [x] Makes properties optional if they extend a certain type
- [ ] Makes all properties required
- [ ] Converts all properties to strings
- [ ] Removes properties that extend a certain type

> **Explanation:** The `OptionalIfExtends` type makes properties optional if they extend a certain type, as shown in the example.

### What is the result of `ElementType<StringArray>` in the practice example?

- [x] string
- [ ] number
- [ ] boolean
- [ ] undefined

> **Explanation:** `ElementType<StringArray>` extracts the element type of the array, which is `string`.

### What is the result of `ElementType<NumberTuple>` in the practice example?

- [x] number
- [ ] string
- [ ] boolean
- [ ] undefined

> **Explanation:** `ElementType<NumberTuple>` extracts the element type of the tuple, which is `number`.

### Why should conditional types be documented?

- [x] To aid understanding of complex types
- [ ] To enforce type constraints
- [ ] To simplify the code
- [ ] To reduce compilation time

> **Explanation:** Providing clear documentation and comments for complex conditional types helps in understanding and maintaining the code.

### True or False: Conditional types can be used for advanced type transformations and metaprogramming.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> **Explanation:** Conditional types are particularly useful for advanced type transformations and metaprogramming, allowing for dynamic and flexible type definitions.
