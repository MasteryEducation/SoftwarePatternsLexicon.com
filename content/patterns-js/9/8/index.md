## 9.8 Recursive and Conditional Type Inference in TypeScript

TypeScript's type system is incredibly powerful, allowing developers to create complex and flexible type definitions. Two advanced features that contribute to this power are recursive types and conditional types. In this section, we'll explore these concepts, provide practical examples, and discuss best practices for leveraging them in your TypeScript projects.

### Understand the Concept

#### Recursive Types

Recursive types are types that refer to themselves, enabling the representation of nested or hierarchical structures. They are particularly useful for defining types like nested arrays or tree-like data structures.

**Example:**

```typescript
type NestedArray<T> = Array<T | NestedArray<T>>;
```

In this example, `NestedArray<T>` is a recursive type that can represent an array of type `T` or another `NestedArray<T>`, allowing for deeply nested arrays.

#### Conditional Types

Conditional types enable type transformations based on conditions, similar to conditional expressions in JavaScript. They are defined using the syntax `T extends U ? X : Y`, where `T` is the type being checked, `U` is the condition, and `X` and `Y` are the resulting types.

**Example:**

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;
```

Here, `IsString<T>` evaluates to `true` if `T` is a string, and `false` otherwise.

### Implementation Steps

#### Define Recursive Types

Recursive types are defined by allowing a type to reference itself. This is particularly useful for defining types that can have nested structures.

**Example:**

```typescript
type NestedArray<T> = Array<T | NestedArray<T>>;
```

This type definition allows for arrays that can contain elements of type `T` or other arrays of the same type, enabling deeply nested arrays.

#### Use Conditional Types

Conditional types are a powerful feature in TypeScript that allow for type transformations based on conditions.

**Syntax:**

```typescript
T extends U ? X : Y
```

**Example:**

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;
```

This conditional type checks if `T` is a string and returns `true` if it is, or `false` otherwise.

#### Implement Type Inference with `infer`

The `infer` keyword is used within conditional types to extract types. This is particularly useful for extracting return types or parameter types from functions.

**Example:**

```typescript
type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any;
```

This type extracts the return type `R` from a function type `T`.

### Code Examples

#### Deep Partial Type

A `DeepPartial` type makes all properties of a type optional, recursively.

```typescript
type DeepPartial<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P] extends object ? DeepPartial<T[P]> : T[P];
};
```

This type recursively makes all properties of an object type `T` optional.

#### Flatten Array Type

A `Flatten` type extracts the element type from an array type.

```typescript
type Flatten<T> = T extends Array<infer U> ? U : T;
```

This type extracts the element type `U` from an array type `T`.

### Use Cases

- **Complex Type Transformations:** Recursive and conditional types allow for complex type transformations, enabling more flexible and reusable type definitions.
- **Flexible and Generic Type Utilities:** These types can be used to create generic utilities that work with a wide range of types, improving code reusability and maintainability.

### Practice

#### Exercise 1: Implement a `DeepReadonly<T>` Type

Create a type `DeepReadonly<T>` that makes all properties of a type `T` readonly, recursively.

```typescript
type DeepReadonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends object ? DeepReadonly<T[P]> : T[P];
};
```

#### Exercise 2: Extract Parameter Types as a Tuple

Create a type that extracts the parameter types of a function as a tuple.

```typescript
type Parameters<T> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never;
```

### Considerations

- **Compiler Limits:** Be cautious of TypeScript's compiler limits with deeply recursive types, as they can lead to performance issues or errors.
- **Base Cases:** Ensure that recursive types have proper base cases to prevent infinite recursion and ensure type safety.

### Best Practices

- **Use Recursive Types Sparingly:** While powerful, recursive types can be complex and difficult to understand. Use them only when necessary.
- **Leverage Conditional Types for Flexibility:** Conditional types can greatly enhance the flexibility of your type definitions. Use them to create adaptable and reusable types.
- **Test Type Definitions:** Regularly test your type definitions to ensure they behave as expected, especially when using advanced features like recursion and conditional logic.

### Conclusion

Recursive and conditional type inference in TypeScript provides powerful tools for creating flexible and reusable type definitions. By understanding and leveraging these features, you can enhance the type safety and maintainability of your TypeScript projects. Practice implementing these types to become proficient in their use and explore their potential in your codebase.

### What is a recursive type in TypeScript?

- [x] A type that refers to itself to represent nested structures.
- [ ] A type that changes based on conditions.
- [ ] A type that is only used for arrays.
- [ ] A type that cannot be used with objects.

> **Explanation:** Recursive types refer to themselves to represent nested or hierarchical structures, such as nested arrays or tree-like data structures.

### What is the syntax for a conditional type in TypeScript?

- [ ] T extends U : X ? Y
- [x] T extends U ? X : Y
- [ ] T ? U : X extends Y
- [ ] T : U extends X ? Y

> **Explanation:** The correct syntax for a conditional type in TypeScript is `T extends U ? X : Y`, where `T` is the type being checked, `U` is the condition, and `X` and `Y` are the resulting types.

### How do you extract the return type of a function using `infer`?

- [ ] type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any;
- [x] type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any;
- [ ] type ReturnType<T> = T extends infer R ? R : any;
- [ ] type ReturnType<T> = infer R extends T ? R : any;

> **Explanation:** The `infer` keyword is used within conditional types to extract types, such as the return type `R` from a function type `T`.

### What does the `DeepPartial` type do?

- [x] Makes all properties of a type optional, recursively.
- [ ] Makes all properties of a type required, recursively.
- [ ] Flattens nested arrays into a single array.
