## 9.16 Composing Promises and Async Functions

In modern web development, handling asynchronous operations efficiently is crucial. JavaScript, with its non-blocking I/O model, provides powerful tools like Promises and `async`/`await` to manage asynchronous code. This section delves into composing Promises and async functions using functional programming techniques, offering cleaner and more readable workflows.

### Introduction to Asynchronous Composition

Asynchronous composition involves structuring your code to handle multiple asynchronous operations in a cohesive and manageable way. By composing Promises and async functions, we can create workflows that are not only efficient but also easy to understand and maintain.

### Composing Promises

Promises are a fundamental part of JavaScript's asynchronous programming model. They represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. Composing Promises involves chaining them together to perform a sequence of asynchronous operations.

#### Chaining Promises

Chaining is a common technique for composing Promises. It allows you to execute a series of asynchronous tasks in sequence, where each task starts after the previous one completes.

```javascript
// Example of chaining Promises
function fetchData(url) {
  return fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log('Data received:', data);
      return data;
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    });
}

// Usage
fetchData('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(data => {
    // Further processing of data
  });
```

In this example, each `.then()` method returns a new Promise, allowing further chaining. The `catch()` method handles any errors that occur during the chain.

#### Combining Promises

Sometimes, you need to perform multiple asynchronous operations concurrently and wait for all of them to complete. JavaScript provides utility functions like `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()` for such scenarios.

- **`Promise.all()`**: Waits for all Promises to resolve and returns an array of results.

```javascript
// Example of Promise.all
const promise1 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data1').then(res => res.json());
const promise2 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data2').then(res => res.json());

Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then(results => {
    console.log('All data received:', results);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error in one of the Promises:', error);
  });
```

- **`Promise.race()`**: Resolves or rejects as soon as one of the Promises resolves or rejects.

```javascript
// Example of Promise.race
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'First'));
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'Second'));

Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
  .then(result => {
    console.log('First resolved:', result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error in race:', error);
  });
```

### Composing Async Functions

With the introduction of `async`/`await` in ES2017, handling asynchronous code became more straightforward. Async functions return Promises, allowing them to be composed similarly to Promises.

#### Using `async`/`await` for Composition

The `async` keyword before a function declaration makes the function return a Promise. Inside an async function, you can use `await` to pause execution until a Promise is resolved.

```javascript
// Example of async/await composition
async function fetchData(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data received:', data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

// Usage
(async () => {
  const data = await fetchData('https://api.example.com/data');
  // Further processing of data
})();
```

This approach makes asynchronous code look synchronous, improving readability and maintainability.

#### Combining Async Functions

Just like Promises, async functions can be combined using `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`.

```javascript
// Example of combining async functions with Promise.all
async function fetchData1() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data1');
  return response.json();
}

async function fetchData2() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data2');
  return response.json();
}

(async () => {
  try {
    const [data1, data2] = await Promise.all([fetchData1(), fetchData2()]);
    console.log('All data received:', data1, data2);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in fetching data:', error);
  }
})();
```

### Benefits of Composing Promises and Async Functions

Composing Promises and async functions offers several benefits:

- **Improved Readability**: Code is easier to read and understand, resembling synchronous code.
- **Better Error Handling**: Errors can be caught and handled in a centralized manner using `catch()` or `try...catch`.
- **Efficient Workflow Management**: Allows for both sequential and concurrent execution of asynchronous tasks.

### Utility Functions for Managing Async Flows

To further enhance the composition of asynchronous functions, utility functions can be employed. These functions abstract common patterns, making code more reusable and concise.

#### Example: Sequential Execution

A utility function to execute async functions sequentially:

```javascript
// Utility function for sequential execution
async function executeSequentially(tasks) {
  const results = [];
  for (const task of tasks) {
    results.push(await task());
  }
  return results;
}

// Usage
const tasks = [
  () => fetchData('https://api.example.com/data1'),
  () => fetchData('https://api.example.com/data2')
];

executeSequentially(tasks)
  .then(results => {
    console.log('Sequential results:', results);
  });
```

#### Example: Retry Logic

A utility function to retry an async operation:

```javascript
// Utility function for retry logic
async function retryAsync(fn, retries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === retries - 1) throw error;
    }
  }
}

// Usage
retryAsync(() => fetchData('https://api.example.com/data'))
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Data received after retry:', data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Failed after retries:', error);
  });
```

### Visualizing Asynchronous Composition

To better understand how Promises and async functions interact, let's visualize their flow using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant API

    User->>App: Request Data
    App->>API: Fetch Data
    API-->>App: Response
    App->>User: Display Data
```

This diagram illustrates a typical asynchronous data fetching process, where the application fetches data from an API and displays it to the user.
