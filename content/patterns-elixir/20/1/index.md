## 20.1. Functional Reactive Programming

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a paradigm that combines the principles of functional programming with reactive data flows. It allows developers to build systems that respond to changes in data over time, making it particularly useful for applications that require dynamic UI updates and real-time data processing. In this section, we will explore how FRP can be implemented in Elixir, leveraging libraries like `Reactrix` to create responsive and efficient applications.

### Concept Overview

Functional Reactive Programming is built on two core concepts: **functional programming** and **reactive programming**. Let's break these down:

- **Functional Programming**: This paradigm emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions. It avoids shared state and mutable data, leading to more predictable and testable code.

- **Reactive Programming**: This paradigm focuses on asynchronous data streams and the propagation of change. It allows systems to react to data changes in real-time, making it ideal for applications that require continuous updates.

By combining these two paradigms, FRP enables developers to create systems that are both declarative and responsive, allowing for more intuitive and maintainable code.

### Implementation in Elixir

Elixir, with its functional nature and robust concurrency model, is well-suited for implementing FRP. One of the libraries that facilitate FRP in Elixir is `Reactrix`. Let's explore how to use this library to build reactive applications.

#### Setting Up Reactrix

To get started with `Reactrix`, you'll need to add it to your Elixir project. Add the following line to your `mix.exs` file under the `deps` function:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:reactrix, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then, run `mix deps.get` to fetch the library.

#### Creating Reactive Streams

With `Reactrix`, you can create reactive streams that represent data flows in your application. Here's a simple example of creating a stream that emits numbers from 1 to 10:

```elixir
alias Reactrix.Stream

stream = Stream.interval(1000)
|> Stream.map(fn _ -> Enum.random(1..10) end)
|> Stream.take(10)

stream
|> Stream.each(&IO.inspect/1)
|> Stream.run()
```

In this example, we create a stream that emits a random number between 1 and 10 every second. The `Stream.each/2` function is used to print each number to the console.

#### Transforming Streams

Streams in `Reactrix` can be transformed using various operators. For instance, you can filter, map, and reduce streams to create complex data flows. Here's an example of filtering even numbers from a stream:

```elixir
stream
|> Stream.filter(fn x -> rem(x, 2) == 0 end)
|> Stream.each(&IO.inspect/1)
|> Stream.run()
```

This code filters the stream to only include even numbers, which are then printed to the console.

#### Combining Streams

One of the powerful features of FRP is the ability to combine multiple streams. This allows you to create complex data flows that react to multiple sources of data. Here's an example of combining two streams:

```elixir
stream1 = Stream.interval(1000) |> Stream.map(fn _ -> Enum.random(1..5) end)
stream2 = Stream.interval(1500) |> Stream.map(fn _ -> Enum.random(6..10) end)

combined_stream = Stream.zip(stream1, stream2)

combined_stream
|> Stream.each(fn {x, y} -> IO.inspect({x, y}) end)
|> Stream.run()
```

In this example, we create two streams that emit random numbers at different intervals. The `Stream.zip/2` function combines these streams into a single stream of tuples.

### Applications of Functional Reactive Programming

FRP is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic UI updates and real-time data processing. Here are some common use cases:

#### Dynamic UI Updates

In modern web applications, UIs need to be responsive to user interactions and data changes. FRP allows you to create UIs that automatically update in response to changes in data. For example, you can use FRP to build a live chat application where messages are displayed in real-time as they are received.

#### Real-Time Data Streams

FRP is ideal for processing real-time data streams, such as sensor data, financial market data, or social media feeds. By using reactive streams, you can build applications that process and analyze data as it arrives, providing immediate insights and actions.

### Visualizing Functional Reactive Programming

To better understand how FRP works, let's visualize the flow of data in a reactive system using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Data Source] --> B[Reactive Stream];
    B --> C[Transformation];
    C --> D[UI Update];
    C --> E[Data Storage];
```

In this diagram, data flows from a source into a reactive stream, where it undergoes transformations. The transformed data is then used to update the UI and store data as needed.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with FRP in Elixir, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- Change the interval of the streams to see how it affects the output.
- Add additional transformations to the streams, such as mapping or reducing.
- Combine more than two streams and explore the resulting data flow.
