## 11.9. Distributed Systems with Multiple Nodes

In the world of distributed systems, Elixir stands out due to its robust concurrency model and the power of the BEAM virtual machine. This section delves into the intricacies of building distributed systems with multiple nodes in Elixir, focusing on node connections, global process registration, data consistency, and the challenges faced in distributed environments.

### Connecting Nodes

To build a distributed system in Elixir, the first step is to establish connections between nodes. Nodes in Elixir are instances of the Erlang runtime system, and they can communicate with each other over a network.

#### Establishing Connections Using Node Names and Cookies

Nodes are identified by names, which are typically in the format `name@hostname`. To connect nodes, they must share a common secret known as a "cookie." This cookie acts as a password, ensuring that only authorized nodes can communicate with each other.

Here's how you can connect nodes:

1. **Start the Nodes**: Launch the nodes with unique names and the same cookie.

```elixir
# Start the first node
iex --sname node1 --cookie secret_cookie

# Start the second node
iex --sname node2 --cookie secret_cookie
```

2. **Connect the Nodes**: Use the `Node.connect/1` function to establish a connection.

```elixir
# On node1
Node.connect(:node2@hostname)
```

3. **Verify the Connection**: Check the list of connected nodes using `Node.list/0`.

```elixir
# On node1
Node.list() # Should return [:node2@hostname]
```

#### Visualizing Node Connections

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Node1] -- Connects to --> B[Node2];
    B -- Connects to --> C[Node3];
    C -- Connects to --> A;
```

### Global Process Registration

In a distributed system, processes running on different nodes need to communicate seamlessly. Global process registration allows processes to be identified by a unique name across nodes.

#### Sharing Process Names Across Nodes

Elixir provides the `:global` module to register processes globally. This ensures that a process can be accessed by its name from any node in the system.

```elixir
# Register a process globally
:global.register_name(:my_process, self())

# Access the process from another node
pid = :global.whereis_name(:my_process)
```

#### Considerations for Global Registration

- **Uniqueness**: Ensure that process names are unique across the entire system to avoid conflicts.
- **Performance**: Global registration can introduce overhead, so use it judiciously.

### Data Consistency and Replication

In distributed systems, maintaining data consistency is a significant challenge. Elixir offers various strategies to handle data consistency and replication.

#### Handling Eventual Consistency

Eventual consistency is a model where updates to a data store are propagated to all nodes, but not necessarily immediately. This model is suitable for systems where availability is prioritized over immediate consistency.

- **Use Case**: Social media feeds, where eventual consistency is acceptable.
- **Implementation**: Use distributed databases like Riak or Cassandra that support eventual consistency.

#### Choosing Appropriate Data Stores

Selecting the right data store is crucial for achieving the desired consistency model. Consider the following options:

- **Riak**: A distributed NoSQL database that offers high availability and eventual consistency.
- **Cassandra**: Known for its linear scalability and eventual consistency.
- **Mnesia**: An Erlang-based distributed database that supports both strong and eventual consistency.

### Challenges in Distributed Systems

Building distributed systems comes with its own set of challenges. Understanding these challenges is essential for designing robust systems.

#### Network Partitioning

Network partitioning occurs when nodes in a distributed system are unable to communicate due to network failures. This can lead to data inconsistency and availability issues.

- **Solution**: Implement partition-tolerant algorithms and use databases that handle partitions gracefully.

#### Latency

Latency is the delay in communication between nodes. It can affect the performance and responsiveness of a distributed system.

- **Solution**: Optimize network configurations and use caching to reduce latency.

#### Distributed Consensus

Achieving consensus in a distributed system is challenging due to the possibility of node failures and network partitions.

- **Solution**: Use consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft to ensure agreement among nodes.

### Code Example: A Simple Distributed System

Let's build a simple distributed system where nodes communicate and share data.

```elixir
defmodule DistributedSystem do
  def start do
    # Start a process and register it globally
    pid = spawn(fn -> loop() end)
    :global.register_name(:shared_process, pid)
  end

  defp loop do
    receive do
      {:message, msg} ->
        IO.puts("Received message: #{msg}")
        loop()
    end
  end

  def send_message(node, msg) do
    # Send a message to the globally registered process
    :rpc.call(node, :global, :whereis_name, [:shared_process])
    |> send({:message, msg})
  end
end

# Start the system on node1
DistributedSystem.start()

# Send a message from node2
DistributedSystem.send_message(:node1@hostname, "Hello from node2!")
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code example by modifying the message content or adding more nodes to the system. Observe how messages are passed between nodes and how global process registration facilitates communication.

### Visualizing the Distributed System

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Node1
    participant Node2
    Node1->>Node2: Connect
    Node2->>Node1: Send Message
    Node1->>Node2: Acknowledge
```
