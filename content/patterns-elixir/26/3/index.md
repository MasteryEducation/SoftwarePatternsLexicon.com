## 26.3. Release Handling with Distillery and Mix Releases

In the world of Elixir, deploying applications efficiently and reliably is crucial for maintaining robust and scalable systems. This section delves into the intricacies of release handling using Distillery and Mix Releases, providing expert guidance on building, configuring, and customizing releases for Elixir applications.

### Building Releases

Building releases in Elixir involves creating self-contained packages of your application, which can be deployed to production environments. These packages include the compiled code, necessary dependencies, and a runtime environment. Let's explore the tools and techniques for building releases in Elixir.

#### Mix Releases for Elixir 1.9+

With the introduction of Elixir 1.9, Mix Releases became the standard tool for building releases. Mix Releases simplify the release process by integrating seamlessly with the Elixir ecosystem.

**Creating a Release with Mix Releases**

To create a release using Mix, follow these steps:

1. **Define a Release in `mix.exs`:**

   Add a release configuration to your `mix.exs` file:

   ```elixir
   defmodule MyApp.MixProject do
     use Mix.Project

     def project do
       [
         app: :my_app,
         version: "0.1.0",
         elixir: "~> 1.9",
         start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
         deps: deps()
       ]
     end

     defp deps do
       []
     end

     defp releases do
       [
         my_app: [
           include_executables_for: [:unix],
           applications: [runtime_tools: :permanent]
         ]
       ]
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Build the Release:**

   Use the Mix task to build the release:

   ```bash
   mix release
   ```

   This command generates a release in the `_build/prod/rel/my_app` directory.

3. **Start the Release:**

   Navigate to the release directory and start the application:

   ```bash
   _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start
   ```

#### Distillery for Earlier Versions

For Elixir versions prior to 1.9, Distillery is the go-to tool for building releases. Distillery provides a powerful and flexible framework for managing releases.

**Creating a Release with Distillery**

1. **Add Distillery to Your Project:**

   Add Distillery as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file:

   ```elixir
   defp deps do
     [
       {:distillery, "~> 2.1"}
     ]
   end
   ```

2. **Initialize Distillery:**

   Run the following command to initialize Distillery:

   ```bash
   mix release.init
   ```

   This command generates a `rel/config.exs` file, which you can customize for your release.

3. **Build the Release:**

   Use the Distillery command to build the release:

   ```bash
   mix release
   ```

4. **Start the Release:**

   Navigate to the release directory and start the application:

   ```bash
   _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start
   ```

### Configuration Management

Managing configurations is a critical aspect of release handling. Elixir provides robust mechanisms for handling environment-specific configurations and sensitive data.

#### Handling Environment-Specific Configurations

Elixir's configuration system allows you to define environment-specific settings in `config/config.exs` and `config/{env}.exs` files. This approach ensures that your application behaves correctly in different environments.

**Example Configuration:**

```elixir
# config/config.exs
use Mix.Config

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  database: "my_app_dev",
  hostname: "localhost",
  pool_size: 10
```

**Environment-Specific Configuration:**

```elixir
# config/prod.exs
use Mix.Config

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: "prod_user",
  password: "prod_pass",
  database: "my_app_prod",
  hostname: "prod_host",
  pool_size: 20
```

#### Using Runtime Configuration for Sensitive Data

For sensitive data like API keys and passwords, it's best to use runtime configuration. This approach allows you to inject sensitive data at runtime, keeping it out of version control.

**Example Runtime Configuration:**

```elixir
# config/releases.exs
use Mix.Config

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: System.get_env("DB_USERNAME"),
  password: System.get_env("DB_PASSWORD"),
  database: System.get_env("DB_NAME"),
  hostname: System.get_env("DB_HOST"),
  pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("DB_POOL_SIZE") || "10")
```

### Customizing Releases

Customizing releases involves including necessary assets, scripts, and configurations to tailor the release to your application's needs.

#### Including Necessary Assets and Scripts

You can include additional files and scripts in your release by specifying them in the release configuration.

**Example:**

```elixir
defp releases do
  [
    my_app: [
      include_executables_for: [:unix],
      applications: [runtime_tools: :permanent],
      steps: [:assemble, &copy_extra_files/1]
    ]
  ]
end

defp copy_extra_files(release) do
  File.cp_r!("priv/static", Path.join(release.path, "static"))
  release
end
```

#### Setting Up Hooks for Pre and Post-Deployment Tasks

Hooks allow you to execute custom scripts before or after certain release tasks, such as starting or stopping the application.

**Example Hook:**

```elixir
# rel/hooks/pre_start.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running pre-start hook"
```

To use the hook, add it to your release configuration:

```elixir
defp releases do
  [
    my_app: [
      include_executables_for: [:unix],
      applications: [runtime_tools: :permanent],
      hooks: [
        pre_start: "rel/hooks/pre_start.sh"
      ]
    ]
  ]
end
```

### Visualizing the Release Process
