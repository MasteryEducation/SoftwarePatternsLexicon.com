## 26.5. Managing Configuration and Secrets

In the realm of software development, managing configuration and secrets is a critical aspect of building secure and maintainable applications. In Elixir, this involves leveraging environment variables, secret management services, and configuration libraries to ensure that sensitive information is handled appropriately and that application settings are flexible and easy to manage.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are a fundamental way to store configuration outside the codebase. This approach provides flexibility and security, as it allows different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) without changing the code.

#### Storing Configuration Outside the Codebase

Storing configuration in environment variables helps in keeping sensitive information out of the codebase. This practice is crucial for maintaining security and ensuring that secrets are not accidentally exposed in version control systems.

```elixir
# Accessing environment variables in Elixir
database_url = System.get_env("DATABASE_URL")
```

In this example, the `DATABASE_URL` is retrieved from the environment, allowing the application to connect to the database without hardcoding the connection string.

#### Using Tools like `dotenv` for Local Development

For local development, managing environment variables can be simplified using tools like `dotenv`. This tool allows developers to define environment variables in a `.env` file, which can be loaded into the application environment.

```elixir
# .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/db_name
```

To load these variables in Elixir, you can use the `dotenv` library:

```elixir
# Load .env file
Dotenv.load()

# Access the environment variable
database_url = System.get_env("DATABASE_URL")
```

This approach ensures that developers can easily manage their local configurations without affecting the production environment.

### Secret Management

Managing secrets securely is paramount to protecting sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. Using dedicated secret management services can help achieve this.

#### Using Services like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager

Services like HashiCorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager provide robust solutions for managing secrets. They offer features such as encryption, access control, and auditing, which are essential for maintaining the security of sensitive data.

**HashiCorp Vault Example:**

```elixir
# Fetching secrets from HashiCorp Vault
{:ok, secret} = Vault.read("secret/data/myapp")
api_key = secret["data"]["api_key"]
```

**AWS Secrets Manager Example:**

```elixir
# Fetching secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
{:ok, secret} = ExAws.SecretsManager.get_secret_value("myapp/api_key")
api_key = secret["SecretString"]
```

These services ensure that secrets are stored securely and accessed only by authorized applications and users.

#### Avoiding Hard-Coded Secrets in Code Repositories

Hard-coding secrets in code repositories is a common security pitfall. Instead, secrets should be stored in environment variables or secret management services, as discussed earlier. This practice prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information and enhances the security posture of the application.

### Configuration Libraries

Elixir provides powerful configuration libraries that enable developers to manage application settings efficiently.

#### Leveraging Libraries like `Config` for Runtime Configuration

The `Config` module in Elixir is a versatile tool for managing application configuration. It allows for runtime configuration, which means settings can be adjusted without recompiling the application.

```elixir
# config/config.exs
import Config

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: System.get_env("DB_USERNAME"),
  password: System.get_env("DB_PASSWORD"),
  database: System.get_env("DB_NAME"),
  hostname: System.get_env("DB_HOST"),
  pool_size: 10
```

This configuration file uses environment variables to set database connection parameters, ensuring that sensitive information is not hardcoded.

#### Structuring Configurations for Clarity and Maintainability

Organizing configuration files is crucial for clarity and maintainability. Group related settings together and use descriptive keys to make the configuration intuitive.

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :my_app,
  ecto_repos: [MyApp.Repo]

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: System.get_env("DB_USERNAME"),
  password: System.get_env("DB_PASSWORD"),
  database: System.get_env("DB_NAME"),
  hostname: System.get_env("DB_HOST"),
  pool_size: 10

config :my_app, :api,
  endpoint: System.get_env("API_ENDPOINT"),
  key: System.get_env("API_KEY")
```

By structuring configurations in this manner, you ensure that the application settings are easy to understand and modify.

### Visualizing Configuration Management

To better understand the flow of configuration management in Elixir applications, let's visualize the process using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[Load Environment Variables]
    B --> C{Use dotenv for Local Development?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Load .env File]
    C -->|No| E[Skip]

    G --> H[Fetch Secrets Securely]
    H --> I[Configure Application with Config Module]

```

This diagram illustrates the steps involved in managing configuration and secrets in an Elixir application, from loading environment variables to running the application with secure settings.
