## 12.6. Circuit Breaker Pattern with `Fuse`

In the world of microservices, ensuring the reliability and resilience of your system is paramount. One of the key patterns used to achieve this is the Circuit Breaker Pattern. This pattern helps prevent cascade failures by halting requests to a failing service, allowing it time to recover. In this section, we'll explore how to implement the Circuit Breaker Pattern in Elixir using the `Fuse` library.

### Understanding the Circuit Breaker Pattern

The Circuit Breaker Pattern is a design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties. It acts as a proxy for operations that might fail, allowing the system to continue functioning even when a part of it is experiencing issues.

#### Key Concepts

- **Closed State**: The circuit breaker allows requests to pass through and monitors for failures.
- **Open State**: The circuit breaker halts requests and returns an error immediately to prevent further failures.
- **Half-Open State**: The circuit breaker allows a limited number of requests to test if the underlying issue has been resolved.

### Preventing Cascade Failures

Cascade failures occur when a failure in one part of the system leads to failures in other parts. The Circuit Breaker Pattern helps prevent this by stopping the flow of requests to a failing service, allowing it time to recover without overwhelming it with additional requests.

### Implementing Circuit Breakers with `Fuse`

`Fuse` is a popular Elixir library that provides a simple and effective way to implement circuit breakers. It allows you to monitor and control service calls, providing a robust mechanism to handle failures gracefully.

#### Installation

To get started with `Fuse`, add it to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:fuse, "~> 2.4"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` to install the library.

#### Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of using `Fuse` to implement a circuit breaker:

```elixir
defmodule MyService do
  require Logger
  use Fuse

  def call_service do
    case Fuse.ask(:my_service, :sync) do
      :ok ->
        # Simulate a service call
        result = external_service_call()
        handle_result(result)

      :blown ->
        Logger.warn("Circuit breaker is open, skipping service call.")
        {:error, :service_unavailable}
    end
  end

  defp external_service_call do
    # Simulate a potential failure
    if :rand.uniform() > 0.7 do
      {:ok, "Success"}
    else
      {:error, "Failure"}
    end
  end

  defp handle_result({:ok, response}) do
    Logger.info("Service call succeeded: #{response}")
    {:ok, response}
  end

  defp handle_result({:error, _reason}) do
    Logger.error("Service call failed.")
    Fuse.melt(:my_service)
    {:error, :service_failed}
  end
end
```

In this example, we define a service call that uses `Fuse` to manage the circuit breaker state. If the service call fails, we "melt" the fuse, which can eventually lead to the circuit breaker opening if failures persist.

### Configuration

`Fuse` allows you to configure various parameters to fine-tune the behavior of your circuit breakers:

- **Thresholds**: Set the number of failures before the circuit breaker opens.
- **Timeouts**: Define how long the circuit breaker remains open before transitioning to the half-open state.
- **Fallback Strategies**: Implement fallback mechanisms to handle requests when the circuit breaker is open.

#### Setting Thresholds and Timeouts

You can configure `Fuse` with specific thresholds and timeouts:

```elixir
Fuse.install(:my_service, {{:standard, 2, 10_000}, {:reset, 60_000}})
```

In this configuration:

- The circuit breaker will open after 2 failures within a 10-second window.
- The circuit breaker will attempt to reset after 60 seconds.

### Visualizing the Circuit Breaker Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Circuit Breaker Pattern, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant CircuitBreaker
    participant Service

    Client->>CircuitBreaker: Request
    CircuitBreaker->>Service: Forward Request
    Service-->>CircuitBreaker: Response
    CircuitBreaker-->>Client: Response

    Note over CircuitBreaker: If failure occurs
    CircuitBreaker-->>Client: Error
    Note over CircuitBreaker: Circuit opens after threshold

    Client->>CircuitBreaker: Request
    CircuitBreaker-->>Client: Error (Circuit Open)

    Note over CircuitBreaker: After timeout, circuit half-opens
    Client->>CircuitBreaker: Request
    CircuitBreaker->>Service: Forward Request
    Service-->>CircuitBreaker: Response
    CircuitBreaker-->>Client: Response
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of requests through the circuit breaker, highlighting the transition between states.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Circuit Breaker Pattern, consider the following:

- **Granularity**: Decide whether to use a circuit breaker per service, per endpoint, or per operation.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement strategies to handle requests when the circuit breaker is open, such as returning cached data or a default response.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Ensure you have adequate logging and monitoring in place to track the state of your circuit breakers and diagnose issues.

### Elixir Unique Features

Elixir's concurrency model and lightweight processes make it particularly well-suited for implementing circuit breakers. The `Fuse` library leverages these features to provide efficient and scalable circuit breaker implementations.

### Differences and Similarities

The Circuit Breaker Pattern is often compared to the Retry Pattern. While both aim to handle failures gracefully, they differ in approach:

- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents further requests to a failing service, allowing it time to recover.
- **Retry**: Attempts to retry failed requests, often with exponential backoff.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Circuit Breaker Pattern, try modifying the code example to:

- Change the failure threshold and observe the behavior.
- Implement a fallback mechanism when the circuit breaker is open.
- Add logging to track the state transitions of the circuit breaker.
