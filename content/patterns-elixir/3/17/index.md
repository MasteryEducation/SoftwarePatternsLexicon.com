## 3.17. Automated Code Formatting with `mix format`

In the world of software development, maintaining a consistent code style is crucial for readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Elixir, a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications, offers a powerful tool for automated code formatting: `mix format`. This tool ensures that your code adheres to a consistent style, making it easier for teams to collaborate and for individual developers to focus on functionality rather than formatting.

### Configuring the Formatter

The first step in leveraging `mix format` is configuring it to suit your project's needs. This involves customizing formatting rules in the `.formatter.exs` file, which is typically located at the root of your Elixir project.

#### Understanding `.formatter.exs`

The `.formatter.exs` file is an Elixir script that returns a keyword list of options. These options dictate how `mix format` will format your code. Here is a basic example of a `.formatter.exs` file:

```elixir
# .formatter.exs
[
  inputs: ["{mix,.formatter}.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}"],
  line_length: 80,
  import_deps: [:ecto, :phoenix]
]
```

- **inputs**: Specifies the files and directories to be formatted. In this example, it includes the mix and formatter files themselves, as well as all `.ex` and `.exs` files in the `config`, `lib`, and `test` directories.
- **line_length**: Sets the maximum line length. This is a common style guide rule that helps keep code readable.
- **import_deps**: Allows you to import formatting rules from dependencies, such as `ecto` and `phoenix`, ensuring that your code style is consistent with these libraries.

#### Customizing Formatting Rules

You can customize the formatting rules to match your team's preferences. Here are some common options:

- **locals_without_parens**: A list of local functions that should be called without parentheses. This can be useful for DSLs or custom macros.
- **export**: Allows you to export the configuration to be used by other projects or tools.

Example of customizing `locals_without_parens`:

```elixir
# .formatter.exs
[
  inputs: ["{mix,.formatter}.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}"],
  line_length: 100,
  locals_without_parens: [my_custom_macro: 1, another_macro: 2]
]
```

### Integrating with Development Tools

To maximize the benefits of `mix format`, integrate it into your development workflow. This ensures that code is consistently formatted before it is committed to version control.

#### Running `mix format` Before Commits

One effective strategy is to run `mix format` automatically before each commit. This can be achieved using Git hooks, specifically the `pre-commit` hook.

1. **Create a Pre-Commit Hook**: Navigate to your project's `.git/hooks` directory and create a file named `pre-commit`.

2. **Add the Following Script**:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
mix format --check-formatted
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Code is not formatted. Please run 'mix format'."
  exit 1
fi
```

3. **Make the Hook Executable**:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This script checks if the code is formatted before allowing a commit. If the code is not formatted, it prompts the developer to run `mix format`.

### Team Collaboration

Ensuring a consistent coding style across team members is essential for collaboration. `mix format` plays a crucial role in achieving this goal.

#### Establishing a Team-Wide Style Guide

While `mix format` provides a default style, teams can establish their own style guide by customizing the `.formatter.exs` file. It's important to document these decisions and ensure all team members are aware of them.

#### Conducting Code Reviews

During code reviews, focus on the logic and functionality rather than formatting issues. With `mix format`, you can be confident that the code adheres to the agreed-upon style, allowing reviewers to concentrate on more critical aspects of the code.

#### Continuous Integration

Incorporate `mix format` into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically check code formatting. This can be done by adding a step in your CI configuration to run `mix format --check-formatted`.

Example for a CI configuration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/elixir.yml
name: Elixir CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Elixir
      uses: actions/setup-elixir@v1
      with:
        elixir-version: '1.12'
        otp-version: '24'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: mix deps.get
    - name: Run formatter
      run: mix format --check-formatted
```

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with `mix format`, try modifying the `.formatter.exs` file in a sample project. Experiment with different options, such as changing the `line_length` or adding functions to `locals_without_parens`. Run `mix format` to see how these changes affect your code.

### Visualizing Code Formatting Workflow

To better understand the workflow of automated code formatting with `mix format`, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Edit .formatter.exs];
    B --> C[Write Code];
    C --> D[Run mix format];
    D --> E{Code Formatted?};
    E -->|Yes| F[Commit Code];
    E -->|No| G[Fix Formatting];
    G --> D;
    F --> H[Push to Repository];
    H --> I[CI/CD Pipeline];
    I --> J{Formatting Check Passed?};
    J -->|Yes| K[Merge Code];
    J -->|No| L[Fix Formatting];
    L --> D;
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates the process of configuring and using `mix format` in a development workflow. It starts with editing the `.formatter.exs` file, writing code, and running `mix format`. If the code is formatted correctly, it can be committed and pushed to the repository. The CI/CD pipeline then checks the formatting, and if it passes, the code is merged.
