## 3.5. Enumerables and Streams

In Elixir, Enumerables and Streams are powerful abstractions that allow developers to work with collections of data efficiently and expressively. They are essential tools for functional programming, enabling you to process data in a declarative and concise manner. In this section, we will delve into the concepts of Enumerables and Streams, explore their functions, and demonstrate how to use them effectively in your Elixir applications.

### Enumerables

Enumerables in Elixir are collections that implement the `Enumerable` protocol, allowing them to be traversed and manipulated using a set of predefined functions. This protocol is fundamental to Elixir's approach to data processing, providing a consistent interface for working with different data structures like lists, maps, and ranges.

#### Key Functions

The `Enum` module in Elixir provides a rich set of functions for working with Enumerables. Let's explore some of the most commonly used functions:

- **`map/2`**: Transforms each element in a collection by applying a given function.

```elixir
# Example: Doubling each element in a list
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
doubled = Enum.map(list, fn x -> x * 2 end)
IO.inspect(doubled) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

- **`filter/2`**: Filters elements in a collection based on a predicate function.

```elixir
# Example: Filtering even numbers from a list
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = Enum.filter(list, fn x -> rem(x, 2) == 0 end)
IO.inspect(evens) # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

- **`reduce/3`**: Reduces a collection to a single value by iteratively applying a function.

```elixir
# Example: Summing all elements in a list
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum = Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc -> x + acc end)
IO.inspect(sum) # Output: 10
```

- **`all?/2`**: Checks if all elements in a collection satisfy a predicate.

```elixir
# Example: Checking if all numbers are positive
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
all_positive = Enum.all?(list, fn x -> x > 0 end)
IO.inspect(all_positive) # Output: true
```

- **`any?/2`**: Checks if any element in a collection satisfies a predicate.

```elixir
# Example: Checking if any number is negative
list = [1, -2, 3, 4]
any_negative = Enum.any?(list, fn x -> x < 0 end)
IO.inspect(any_negative) # Output: true
```

#### Working with Maps

Enumerables are not limited to lists. You can also work with maps using the `Enum` module:

```elixir
# Example: Transforming values in a map
map = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
incremented_map = Enum.map(map, fn {k, v} -> {k, v + 1} end)
IO.inspect(incremented_map) # Output: [a: 2, b: 3, c: 4]
```

### Streams

Streams in Elixir provide a way to work with potentially infinite data sources or large datasets without loading everything into memory at once. They achieve this through lazy evaluation, meaning computations are deferred until the data is actually needed.

#### Creating Streams

You can create streams using the `Stream` module, which provides functions similar to those in `Enum`, but they operate lazily:

- **`Stream.map/2`**: Lazily transforms each element in a collection.

```elixir
# Example: Creating a stream that doubles each element
stream = Stream.map(1..4, fn x -> x * 2 end)
IO.inspect(Enum.to_list(stream)) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

- **`Stream.filter/2`**: Lazily filters elements based on a predicate.

```elixir
# Example: Creating a stream of even numbers
stream = Stream.filter(1..6, fn x -> rem(x, 2) == 0 end)
IO.inspect(Enum.to_list(stream)) # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

#### Infinite Streams

One of the most powerful features of streams is their ability to represent infinite sequences:

```elixir
# Example: Generating an infinite stream of natural numbers
natural_numbers = Stream.iterate(1, &(&1 + 1))
first_ten = Enum.take(natural_numbers, 10)
IO.inspect(first_ten) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

#### Composing Streams

Streams can be composed to build complex data processing pipelines:

```elixir
# Example: Composing multiple stream transformations
stream = 1..10
|> Stream.map(&(&1 * 2))
|> Stream.filter(&rem(&1, 3) == 0)

result = Enum.to_list(stream)
IO.inspect(result) # Output: [6, 12, 18]
```

### Performance Considerations

Streams are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when performing I/O operations, as they allow you to process data in chunks rather than loading everything into memory. This can lead to significant performance improvements and reduced memory usage.

### Visualizing Enumerables and Streams

To better understand how Enumerables and Streams work, let's visualize the flow of data through a series of transformations:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Data Source] --> B[Enumerable]
    B --> C[Transformation 1]
    C --> D[Transformation 2]
    D --> E[Final Result]
```

In this diagram, data flows from the source through a series of transformations, ultimately producing the final result. Streams allow these transformations to be applied lazily, processing data only as needed.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code examples to deepen your understanding of Enumerables and Streams. Try modifying the functions or data to see how the output changes:

```elixir
# Experiment with different transformations
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
transformed = list
|> Enum.map(&(&1 * 3))
|> Enum.filter(&(&1 > 5))
IO.inspect(transformed) # Output: [6, 9, 12, 15]

# Create a stream and apply transformations
stream = Stream.cycle([1, 2, 3])
|> Stream.take(10)
|> Stream.map(&(&1 * 2))
result = Enum.to_list(stream)
IO.inspect(result) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6, 2]
```
