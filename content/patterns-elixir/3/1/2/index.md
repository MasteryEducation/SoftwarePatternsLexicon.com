## 3.1.2. Structs and Protocols

In the world of Elixir, understanding the concepts of Structs and Protocols is crucial for building robust and scalable applications. These features allow developers to define custom data types and achieve polymorphism, which are essential for maintaining clean and efficient codebases. Let's dive deep into these concepts and explore how they can be leveraged in your Elixir projects.

### Structs in Elixir

Structs in Elixir are custom data types built on top of maps. They provide a way to define a set of keys with default values, ensuring data integrity and consistency across your application.

#### Defining Structs

To define a struct, you use the `defstruct` keyword within a module. Here's a simple example:

```elixir
defmodule User do
  defstruct name: "Anonymous", age: 0, email: nil
end
```

In this example, we define a `User` struct with three fields: `name`, `age`, and `email`. Each field has a default value, which is used if no value is provided when creating an instance of the struct.

#### Creating and Using Structs

Creating an instance of a struct is straightforward:

```elixir
# Creating a User struct with default values
user1 = %User{}

# Creating a User struct with custom values
user2 = %User{name: "Alice", age: 30, email: "alice@example.com"}
```

Structs are immutable, meaning that once a struct is created, its fields cannot be changed. However, you can create a new struct with updated values using the `|` operator:

```elixir
# Updating the age of user2
user3 = %User{user2 | age: 31}
```

#### Enforcing Data Integrity

One of the key benefits of using structs is data integrity. Unlike maps, structs enforce the presence of predefined keys, preventing accidental typos or missing fields:

```elixir
# This will raise a KeyError because :username is not a defined key
user4 = %User{username: "Bob"}
```

#### Structs vs. Maps

While structs are built on top of maps, they offer additional benefits such as enforced keys and default values. However, it's important to note that structs do not support dynamic keys, which can be a limitation in certain scenarios.

### Protocols in Elixir

Protocols in Elixir provide a mechanism for achieving polymorphism, allowing you to define a common interface for different data types. This is particularly useful when you want to implement the same functionality across various types without relying on inheritance.

#### Defining Protocols

A protocol is defined using the `defprotocol` keyword. Here's an example of a simple protocol for converting data to a string:

```elixir
defprotocol Stringify do
  @doc "Converts a data structure to a string"
  def to_string(data)
end
```

#### Implementing Protocols

Once a protocol is defined, you can implement it for different data types using the `defimpl` keyword:

```elixir
defimpl Stringify, for: User do
  def to_string(user) do
    "User: #{user.name}, Age: #{user.age}, Email: #{user.email}"
  end
end

defimpl Stringify, for: Map do
  def to_string(map) do
    Enum.map(map, fn {key, value} -> "#{key}: #{value}" end)
    |> Enum.join(", ")
  end
end
```

In this example, we implement the `Stringify` protocol for both the `User` struct and the `Map` data type. This allows us to call `Stringify.to_string/1` on any `User` or `Map` instance:

```elixir
IO.puts Stringify.to_string(user2) # Output: User: Alice, Age: 30, Email: alice@example.com
IO.puts Stringify.to_string(%{foo: "bar", baz: "qux"}) # Output: foo: bar, baz: qux
```

#### Protocols and Polymorphism

Protocols are a powerful tool for achieving polymorphism in Elixir. They allow you to define a common interface for different data types, enabling you to write flexible and reusable code.

### Visualizing Structs and Protocols

To better understand the relationship between structs and protocols, let's visualize how they interact using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        -String name
        -int age
        -String email
        +to_string() String
    }

    class Map {
        +to_string() String
    }

    class Stringify {
        <<interface>>
        +to_string(data) String
    }

    Stringify <|.. User
    Stringify <|.. Map
```

In this diagram, the `Stringify` protocol acts as an interface, with `User` and `Map` implementing the `to_string` method. This illustrates how protocols enable polymorphism by allowing different data types to share a common interface.

### Best Practices for Using Structs and Protocols

- **Use Structs for Data Integrity**: Leverage structs to enforce data integrity and consistency across your application. Define default values and ensure that all required fields are present.
- **Implement Protocols for Polymorphism**: Use protocols to define common interfaces for different data types. This allows you to write flexible and reusable code without relying on inheritance.
- **Avoid Overusing Protocols**: While protocols are powerful, they should be used judiciously. Overusing protocols can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain codebases.
- **Document Protocol Implementations**: Clearly document each protocol implementation to ensure that other developers understand the intended behavior for each data type.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of structs and protocols, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Add a New Field to the User Struct**: Add a new field to the `User` struct, such as `:role`, and update the `Stringify` implementation to include this field in the output.
- **Implement the Stringify Protocol for a New Data Type**: Choose a new data type, such as a list or tuple, and implement the `Stringify` protocol for it.
- **Create a New Protocol**: Define a new protocol for a different functionality, such as converting data to JSON, and implement it for the `User` struct and another data type.
