## 23.10. Security Testing and Auditing

In the realm of software development, security is paramount. As expert software engineers and architects, it is crucial to ensure that our Elixir applications are not only functional but also secure against potential threats. This section delves into the essential practices of security testing and auditing, focusing on penetration testing, automated security scans, and regular audits. By the end of this guide, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to fortify your Elixir applications against vulnerabilities.

### Introduction to Security Testing and Auditing

Security testing and auditing are integral components of the software development lifecycle. They help identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with security standards, and protect sensitive data. In Elixir, leveraging its robust features and the BEAM VM's inherent fault tolerance, we can build secure applications. However, no system is impervious to attacks, making security testing and auditing indispensable.

### Penetration Testing

Penetration testing, often referred to as ethical hacking, involves simulating attacks on a system to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. This proactive approach helps in understanding the security posture of an application.

#### Steps in Penetration Testing

1. **Planning and Reconnaissance**: Define the scope and objectives of the test. Gather intelligence to understand potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Scanning**: Use tools to identify open ports, services, and potential entry points.
3. **Gaining Access**: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
4. **Maintaining Access**: Simulate advanced persistent threats by maintaining access to the system.
5. **Analysis and Reporting**: Document findings, including vulnerabilities discovered, data accessed, and the duration of the test.

#### Tools for Penetration Testing

- **Metasploit**: A powerful framework for developing and executing exploit code.
- **Nmap**: A network scanning tool to discover hosts and services.
- **Burp Suite**: A web vulnerability scanner for identifying security issues in web applications.

#### Code Example: Simulating a Simple Attack

```elixir
defmodule PenTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A simple module to simulate an attack by attempting to access a restricted function.
  """

  def simulate_attack do
    try do
      restricted_function()
    rescue
      e in RuntimeError -> IO.puts("Access Denied: #{e.message}")
    end
  end

  defp restricted_function do
    raise "Unauthorized access attempt detected!"
  end
end

# Simulate the attack
PenTest.simulate_attack()
```

### Automated Security Scans

Automated security scans are essential for continuously monitoring and identifying vulnerabilities in your codebase. Tools like Sobelow are specifically designed for Elixir applications, providing a comprehensive analysis of security issues.

#### Using Sobelow for Security Analysis

Sobelow is an open-source security-focused static analysis tool for the Phoenix framework. It scans your application for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and configuration issues.

#### Setting Up Sobelow

1. **Installation**: Add Sobelow to your `mix.exs` file.

   ```elixir
   defp deps do
     [
       {:sobelow, "~> 0.11", only: :dev}
     ]
   end
   ```

2. **Running Sobelow**: Execute the following command to scan your application.

   ```bash
   mix sobelow
   ```

3. **Interpreting Results**: Sobelow provides a detailed report of potential vulnerabilities, categorized by severity.

#### Code Example: Configuring Sobelow

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    {:sobelow, "~> 0.11", only: :dev}
  ]
end

# Run Sobelow
# In the terminal, execute:
# mix sobelow
```

### Regular Audits

Regular audits involve a systematic review of your application's code and configurations to ensure compliance with security standards and best practices. Audits help in identifying overlooked vulnerabilities and maintaining a secure codebase.

#### Conducting a Security Audit

1. **Define Audit Scope**: Determine the areas of the application to be audited, including code, configurations, and third-party dependencies.
2. **Review Code**: Analyze the code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on authentication, authorization, and data handling.
3. **Check Configurations**: Ensure that configurations adhere to security best practices, such as using HTTPS and secure cookie settings.
4. **Evaluate Dependencies**: Assess third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities and ensure they are up-to-date.
5. **Document Findings**: Provide a detailed report of the audit, including recommendations for remediation.

#### Code Example: Simple Configuration Audit

```elixir
defmodule ConfigAudit do
  @moduledoc """
  A module to audit application configurations for security best practices.
  """

  def check_https_config do
    config = Application.get_env(:my_app, MyApp.Endpoint)
    if config[:url][:scheme] != "https" do
      IO.puts("Warning: HTTPS is not enabled!")
    else
      IO.puts("HTTPS is enabled.")
    end
  end
end

# Perform the audit
ConfigAudit.check_https_config()
```

### Best Practices for Security Testing and Auditing

- **Integrate Security Early**: Incorporate security testing and auditing into the development lifecycle from the beginning.
- **Use a Combination of Tools**: Employ multiple tools and techniques for comprehensive security coverage.
- **Regularly Update Tools**: Ensure that security tools are up-to-date to detect the latest vulnerabilities.
- **Educate Your Team**: Provide training on security best practices and the importance of security testing and auditing.
- **Document and Review**: Maintain detailed documentation of security tests and audits for future reference and compliance.
