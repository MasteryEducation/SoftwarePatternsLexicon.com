## 23.13. Dealing with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and CSRF

In the world of web development, security is paramount. Two of the most common vulnerabilities that web applications face are Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). As expert software engineers and architects, understanding and implementing effective strategies to mitigate these threats is crucial. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of XSS and CSRF, explore how they can be exploited, and provide comprehensive strategies to prevent them in Elixir applications.

### Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, and even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

#### Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS**: Malicious scripts are stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
2. **Reflected XSS**: Malicious scripts are reflected off a web server, typically via a URL or a form submission.
3. **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.

#### Preventing XSS

To prevent XSS attacks, it is essential to sanitize and escape user input before rendering it on a web page. Elixir, with its Phoenix framework, provides several tools and best practices to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

##### Escaping Output in Templates

Escaping output is a fundamental technique to prevent XSS. In Phoenix, the default templating engine, EEx, automatically escapes output to prevent XSS attacks. However, developers must remain vigilant when using raw HTML or JavaScript.

```elixir
# Example of escaping output in a Phoenix template
<%= @user_input %> <!-- This will be automatically escaped -->
```

For cases where you need to render raw HTML, use the `raw/1` function cautiously:

```elixir
# Rendering raw HTML (use with caution)
<%= raw @safe_html_content %>
```

##### Using Content Security Policy (CSP)

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a powerful tool to mitigate XSS attacks by specifying which sources of content are allowed to be loaded and executed. Implementing a CSP can significantly reduce the risk of XSS.

```elixir
# Example of setting a Content Security Policy in a Phoenix application
plug :put_secure_browser_headers, %{
  "content-security-policy" => "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.cdn.com"
}
```

### Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as changing account settings or making transactions.

#### Defending Against CSRF

The primary defense against CSRF attacks is the use of CSRF tokens. These tokens are unique to each session and are included in forms and requests to verify the legitimacy of the request.

##### Using CSRF Tokens in Forms and Requests

Phoenix provides built-in support for CSRF protection. When using forms, Phoenix automatically includes a CSRF token.

```elixir
# Example of a form with a CSRF token in a Phoenix template
<%= form_for @changeset, @action, fn f -> %>
  <%= hidden_input f, :csrf_token, value: get_csrf_token() %>
  <%= submit "Submit" %>
<% end %>
```

For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers:

```javascript
// Example of including a CSRF token in an AJAX request
let csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name='csrf-token']").getAttribute("content");

fetch("/some_endpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-CSRF-Token": csrfToken
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ data: "example" })
});
```

### Securing Cookies

Cookies are often used to store session data and other sensitive information. Securing cookies is crucial to prevent them from being accessed by malicious scripts.

#### Setting HTTP-only and Secure Flags

1. **HTTP-only Flag**: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
2. **Secure Flag**: Ensures that cookies are only sent over HTTPS, protecting them from being intercepted.

```elixir
# Example of setting secure cookie options in a Phoenix application
plug Plug.Session,
  store: :cookie,
  key: "_my_app_key",
  signing_salt: "random_salt",
  secure: true, # Only send cookies over HTTPS
  http_only: true # Prevent JavaScript access
```

### Visualizing XSS and CSRF Attacks

To better understand how XSS and CSRF attacks work, let's visualize the process using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### XSS Attack Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    participant Attacker

    User->>Browser: Visit trusted site
    Browser->>Server: Request page
    Server->>Browser: Send page with malicious script
    Browser->>User: Render page
    User->>Attacker: Execute malicious script
```

#### CSRF Attack Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant TrustedSite
    participant AttackerSite

    User->>Browser: Visit TrustedSite
    Browser->>TrustedSite: Authenticate and get session
    User->>Browser: Visit AttackerSite
    Browser->>AttackerSite: Load malicious content
    AttackerSite->>TrustedSite: Send forged request
    TrustedSite->>Browser: Execute request with User's session
```
