## 23.5. Secure Communication with SSL/TLS

In today's digital landscape, ensuring secure communication over the internet is paramount. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. In this section, we will delve into how to implement HTTPS in Elixir applications, configure SSL certificates in Phoenix, select strong cipher suites, and manage certificates using tools like Let's Encrypt.

### Understanding SSL/TLS

SSL/TLS protocols are essential for encrypting data transmitted over the internet, ensuring that sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data remain confidential. They also provide authentication, ensuring that the server you are communicating with is indeed who it claims to be.

#### Key Concepts

- **Encryption**: Converts data into a secure format that can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the parties involved in the communication.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission.

### Implementing HTTPS in Elixir

To implement HTTPS in your Elixir application, you need to configure your Phoenix server to use SSL/TLS. This involves obtaining an SSL certificate, configuring your server to use it, and ensuring that your application is set up to handle secure connections.

#### Configuring SSL Certificates in Phoenix

Phoenix, a popular web framework for Elixir, provides built-in support for SSL/TLS. Here's how you can configure SSL certificates in a Phoenix application:

1. **Obtain an SSL Certificate**: You can purchase an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or use a free service like Let's Encrypt.

2. **Configure Phoenix to Use SSL**: Update your Phoenix application's configuration to use the SSL certificate.

```elixir
# config/prod.exs

config :my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
  https: [
    port: 443,
    cipher_suite: :strong,
    keyfile: System.get_env("SSL_KEY_PATH"),
    certfile: System.get_env("SSL_CERT_PATH")
  ]
```

- **`port: 443`**: The standard port for HTTPS.
- **`cipher_suite: :strong`**: Ensures that only strong encryption algorithms are used.
- **`keyfile` and `certfile`**: Paths to your SSL certificate and private key files.

3. **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**: Ensure that all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/router.ex

pipeline :browser do
  plug :accepts, ["html"]
  plug :fetch_session
  plug :fetch_flash
  plug :protect_from_forgery
  plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  plug :force_ssl
end
```

- **`plug :force_ssl`**: Redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

### Cipher Suites

Cipher suites are a combination of encryption algorithms used to secure a network connection. Selecting strong cipher suites is crucial for maintaining the security of your application.

#### Selecting Strong Encryption Algorithms

When configuring SSL/TLS, it's important to choose cipher suites that provide strong encryption. Weak cipher suites can be vulnerable to attacks, compromising the security of your application.

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A widely used encryption standard that provides strong security.
- **ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral)**: Provides forward secrecy, ensuring that even if a session key is compromised, past communications remain secure.
- **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**: A cryptographic hash function that provides data integrity.

In Phoenix, you can specify the cipher suites to use:

```elixir
# config/prod.exs

config :my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
  https: [
    port: 443,
    cipher_suite: :strong,
    keyfile: System.get_env("SSL_KEY_PATH"),
    certfile: System.get_env("SSL_CERT_PATH"),
    ciphers: [
      "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
      "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
      "ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305",
      "ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305"
    ]
  ]
```

### Certificate Management

Managing SSL certificates is an essential part of maintaining a secure application. Certificates need to be renewed periodically, and it's important to ensure that they are always up to date.

#### Using Let's Encrypt for SSL Certificates

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority that provides SSL certificates. It simplifies the process of obtaining and renewing certificates.

1. **Install Certbot**: Certbot is a tool that automates the process of obtaining and renewing Let's Encrypt certificates.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
```

2. **Obtain a Certificate**: Use Certbot to obtain a certificate for your domain.

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
```

3. **Automate Renewal**: Set up a cron job to automatically renew your certificates.

```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
```

### Visualizing SSL/TLS Communication

To better understand how SSL/TLS works, let's visualize the process of establishing a secure connection.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    Client->>Server: ClientHello
    Server->>Client: ServerHello
    Server->>Client: Certificate
    Client->>Server: Key Exchange
    Server->>Client: Finished
    Client->>Server: Finished
    Client->>Server: Encrypted Data
    Server->>Client: Encrypted Data
```

- **ClientHello**: The client sends a message to the server indicating the supported cipher suites and SSL/TLS version.
- **ServerHello**: The server responds with the chosen cipher suite and SSL/TLS version.
- **Certificate**: The server sends its SSL certificate to the client for authentication.
- **Key Exchange**: The client and server exchange keys to establish a secure session.
- **Finished**: Both parties confirm that the handshake is complete.
- **Encrypted Data**: Secure communication begins with encrypted data transmission.
