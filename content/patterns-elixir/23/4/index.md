## 23.4. Data Encryption and Cryptography

In today's digital age, data encryption and cryptography are essential for securing sensitive information. As expert software engineers and architects, understanding how to implement these techniques in Elixir is crucial for building secure applications. This section will guide you through encrypting sensitive data, hashing and salting passwords, and ensuring secure communication using Elixir's powerful libraries.

### Encrypting Sensitive Data

Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a coded format, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. In Elixir, we can leverage the `:crypto` module and libraries like `Comeonin` to encrypt sensitive data effectively.

#### Using the `:crypto` Module

The `:crypto` module in Elixir provides a set of cryptographic functions that are part of the Erlang OpenSSL library. It allows us to perform encryption and decryption using various algorithms.

**Example: AES Encryption**

```elixir
defmodule Encryption do
  @moduledoc """
  A module for encrypting and decrypting data using AES.
  """

  @aes_key :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(32) # Generate a random 256-bit key
  @aes_iv :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(16)  # Generate a random 128-bit IV

  @doc """
  Encrypts the given plaintext using AES.
  """
  def encrypt(plaintext) do
    :crypto.block_encrypt(:aes_cbc256, @aes_key, @aes_iv, plaintext)
  end

  @doc """
  Decrypts the given ciphertext using AES.
  """
  def decrypt(ciphertext) do
    :crypto.block_decrypt(:aes_cbc256, @aes_key, @aes_iv, ciphertext)
  end
end
```

In this example, we use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key and a 128-bit initialization vector (IV) for encryption. The `:crypto.block_encrypt/4` and `:crypto.block_decrypt/4` functions perform the encryption and decryption, respectively.

**Try It Yourself**

- Modify the key and IV lengths to experiment with different AES configurations.
- Test the encryption and decryption functions with various plaintext inputs.

#### Using the `Comeonin` Library

`Comeonin` is a popular Elixir library for password hashing and encryption. It provides a simple interface for securely handling passwords.

**Example: Password Hashing with `Comeonin.Bcrypt`**

```elixir
defmodule Password do
  @moduledoc """
  A module for hashing and verifying passwords using Bcrypt.
  """

  alias Comeonin.Bcrypt

  @doc """
  Hashes the given password.
  """
  def hash_password(password) do
    Bcrypt.hash_pwd_salt(password)
  end

  @doc """
  Verifies the given password against the stored hash.
  """
  def verify_password(password, stored_hash) do
    Bcrypt.check_pass(password, stored_hash)
  end
end
```

In this example, we use `Comeonin.Bcrypt` to hash passwords securely. The `hash_pwd_salt/1` function hashes the password with a salt, and `check_pass/2` verifies the password against the stored hash.

**Try It Yourself**

- Experiment with different passwords and observe the generated hashes.
- Test the verification function with correct and incorrect passwords.

### Hashing and Salting

Hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code. Salting involves adding random data to the input of a hash function to ensure unique outputs.

#### Protecting Passwords and Personal Data

Hashing and salting are crucial for protecting passwords and personal data. By storing only the hashed and salted versions of passwords, we can prevent unauthorized access even if the database is compromised.

**Example: Hashing and Salting with `Comeonin.Argon2`**

```elixir
defmodule SecurePassword do
  @moduledoc """
  A module for hashing and verifying passwords using Argon2.
  """

  alias Comeonin.Argon2

  @doc """
  Hashes the given password with a salt.
  """
  def hash_password(password) do
    Argon2.hash_pwd_salt(password)
  end

  @doc """
  Verifies the given password against the stored hash.
  """
  def verify_password(password, stored_hash) do
    Argon2.check_pass(password, stored_hash)
  end
end
```

In this example, we use `Comeonin.Argon2` for hashing and salting passwords. Argon2 is a modern and secure hashing algorithm designed to resist brute-force attacks.

**Try It Yourself**

- Compare the performance and security of Argon2 with Bcrypt.
- Experiment with different hashing parameters to balance security and performance.

### Transport Layer Security

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures secure communication over networks. It encrypts data transmitted between clients and servers, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.

#### Ensuring Secure Communication

In Elixir, we can use the `:ssl` module to establish secure connections using TLS. This is particularly important for web applications and APIs that handle sensitive data.

**Example: Establishing a Secure Connection**

```elixir
defmodule SecureConnection do
  @moduledoc """
  A module for establishing secure connections using TLS.
  """

  @doc """
  Connects to a server securely using TLS.
  """
  def connect(host, port) do
    :ssl.start()
    {:ok, socket} = :ssl.connect(host, port, [])
    socket
  end
end
```

In this example, we use the `:ssl.connect/3` function to establish a secure connection to a server. The `:ssl.start/0` function initializes the SSL application.

**Try It Yourself**

- Test the secure connection function with different hosts and ports.
- Implement error handling for connection failures.

### Visualizing Cryptographic Processes

To better understand the cryptographic processes, let's visualize the flow of data encryption and decryption using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    Client->>Server: Send plaintext
    Server->>Server: Encrypt plaintext
    Server->>Client: Send ciphertext
    Client->>Client: Decrypt ciphertext
```

**Description:** This diagram illustrates the process of encrypting plaintext on the server side and decrypting it on the client side. The client sends plaintext to the server, which encrypts it and returns the ciphertext. The client then decrypts the ciphertext to retrieve the original plaintext.
