## 23.8. Secure Configuration Management

In the realm of software development, secure configuration management is paramount to safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring the integrity of applications. For Elixir developers, understanding how to manage secrets, protect configuration files, and secure deployments is crucial. This section delves into these aspects, providing expert guidance for implementing secure configuration management in Elixir applications.

### Managing Secrets

Managing secrets, such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys, is a critical component of secure configuration management. In Elixir, there are several strategies to handle secrets securely:

#### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables are a common method for managing secrets. They allow you to separate sensitive data from your codebase, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Here's how you can use environment variables in Elixir:

```elixir
# config/config.exs

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: System.get_env("DB_USERNAME"),
  password: System.get_env("DB_PASSWORD"),
  database: System.get_env("DB_NAME"),
  hostname: System.get_env("DB_HOST"),
  pool_size: 10
```

**Key Points:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Environment variables keep sensitive data out of your source code.
- **Flexibility:** Easily change configurations without modifying code.
- **Security:** Environment variables can be managed securely by the operating system.

#### Using Vaults for Secrets

For enhanced security, consider using a secrets management tool like HashiCorp Vault. Vault provides a centralized, secure way to store and access secrets. Here's how you can integrate Vault with an Elixir application:

1. **Install and Configure Vault:**
   - Set up a Vault server and configure it to store your secrets.

2. **Access Secrets in Elixir:**
   - Use a library like `vault-elixir` to interact with Vault.

```elixir
# Fetching secrets from Vault
{:ok, vault_client} = Vault.new()
{:ok, secret} = Vault.read(vault_client, "secret/data/my_app")

db_username = secret["data"]["username"]
db_password = secret["data"]["password"]
```

**Benefits of Using Vault:**
- **Centralized Management:** Store all secrets in one place.
- **Access Control:** Fine-grained access control policies.
- **Audit Logging:** Track who accessed which secrets and when.

### Configuration Files

Configuration files often contain sensitive information that needs protection. Here are best practices for securing configuration files in Elixir:

#### Protecting Files Containing Sensitive Data

1. **Encryption:**
   - Encrypt sensitive configuration files to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Access Control:**
   - Restrict file permissions to limit access to authorized users only.

3. **Version Control:**
   - Avoid storing sensitive data in version control systems. Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files.

```plaintext
# .gitignore

# Ignore configuration files containing secrets
config/secrets.exs
```

#### Example of Secure Configuration File

```elixir
# config/prod.secret.exs

use Mix.Config

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: "encrypted_username",
  password: "encrypted_password",
  database: "my_app_prod",
  hostname: "prod_db_host",
  pool_size: 15
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Encryption:** Use tools like GPG or OpenSSL for file encryption.
- **Access Control:** Ensure only necessary personnel have access to configuration files.

### Deployment Considerations

Securing configurations during deployment is crucial to prevent leaks and unauthorized access. Here are strategies to ensure secure deployments:

#### Ensuring Configurations Are Secure in All Environments

1. **Environment-Specific Configurations:**
   - Use environment-specific configuration files to separate development, testing, and production settings.

```elixir
# config/config.exs

import_config "#{Mix.env()}.exs"
```

2. **Secure Deployment Pipelines:**
   - Use CI/CD tools to automate deployments, ensuring configurations are applied securely.

3. **Secrets Management in CI/CD:**
   - Integrate secrets management tools with your CI/CD pipeline to securely inject secrets during deployment.

#### Example Deployment Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Elixir
        uses: actions/setup-elixir@v1
        with:
          elixir-version: '1.12'
          otp-version: '24.0'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: mix deps.get

      - name: Build release
        run: mix release

      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          DB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DB_USERNAME }}
          DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Tailor configurations for each environment.
- **Secure Pipelines:** Use secure methods to handle secrets in CI/CD pipelines.

### Visualizing Secure Configuration Management

To better understand the flow of secure configuration management, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Developer
    participant CI/CD
    participant Vault
    participant Production

    Developer->>CI/CD: Push code
    CI/CD->>Vault: Retrieve secrets
    CI/CD->>Production: Deploy application with secrets
    Production->>Vault: Access secrets securely
```

**Diagram Description:**
- **Developer:** Initiates the deployment process by pushing code.
- **CI/CD:** Retrieves secrets from Vault and deploys the application.
- **Vault:** Provides secure access to secrets.
- **Production:** Runs the application with securely managed secrets.
