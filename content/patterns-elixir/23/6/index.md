## 23.6. Input Validation and Sanitization

In the realm of software development, especially when dealing with web applications, input validation and sanitization are crucial for maintaining security and data integrity. In Elixir, a language known for its robustness and concurrency, these practices are no less important. This section will guide you through the best practices for input validation and sanitization in Elixir, focusing on using Ecto changesets, sanitizing inputs, and preventing injection attacks.

### Validating User Inputs

Input validation is the first line of defense against malicious data. It ensures that the data received by your application is both expected and safe to process. In Elixir, Ecto changesets provide a powerful mechanism for validating data.

#### Using Ecto Changesets for Data Validation

Ecto is a database wrapper and query generator for Elixir, and changesets are its primary tool for data validation and casting. Changesets allow you to define a set of rules that data must adhere to before it is considered valid.

**Example: Basic Changeset Validation**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  schema "users" do
    field :name, :string
    field :email, :string
    field :age, :integer
  end

  def changeset(user, params \\ %{}) do
    user
    |> cast(params, [:name, :email, :age])
    |> validate_required([:name, :email])
    |> validate_format(:email, ~r/@/)
    |> validate_number(:age, greater_than: 0)
  end
end
```

In this example, we define a `User` schema and a `changeset` function. The `cast/3` function is used to filter and cast the input parameters, while `validate_required/2`, `validate_format/3`, and `validate_number/3` are used to enforce validation rules.

**Key Points:**

- **Casting**: Converts input data into the appropriate types.
- **Validation**: Ensures data meets specified criteria.
- **Error Messages**: Automatically generated for invalid data, aiding in debugging and user feedback.

#### Advanced Changeset Validations

Ecto changesets also support more complex validations, such as custom validation functions and constraints.

**Example: Custom Validation**

```elixir
def validate_username(changeset) do
  validate_change(changeset, :name, fn :name, name ->
    if String.length(name) < 3 do
      [name: "must be at least 3 characters long"]
    else
      []
    end
  end)
end

def changeset(user, params \\ %{}) do
  user
  |> cast(params, [:name, :email, :age])
  |> validate_required([:name, :email])
  |> validate_format(:email, ~r/@/)
  |> validate_number(:age, greater_than: 0)
  |> validate_username()
end
```

In this example, `validate_username/1` is a custom validation function that checks the length of the username.

### Sanitizing Inputs

Sanitization involves cleaning input data to remove or encode potentially harmful content. This is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

#### Removing or Encoding Potentially Harmful Data

Sanitization can be achieved by removing unwanted characters or encoding data to neutralize harmful content.

**Example: HTML Sanitization**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Sanitizer do
  def sanitize_html(input) do
    input
    |> String.replace(~r/<.*?>/u, "")
    |> String.replace(~r/&/, "&amp;")
    |> String.replace(~r/</, "&lt;")
    |> String.replace(~r/>/, "&gt;")
  end
end
```

This function removes HTML tags and encodes special characters to prevent XSS attacks.

**Key Points:**

- **Neutralization**: Converts potentially harmful data into a safe format.
- **Encoding**: Transforms special characters to prevent execution as code.

### Preventing Injection Attacks

Injection attacks occur when untrusted data is executed as code. Elixir provides several mechanisms to prevent these attacks, particularly through the use of Ecto and parameterized queries.

#### Avoiding the Execution of Untrusted Code

Parameterized queries in Ecto automatically escape input data, preventing SQL injection.

**Example: Safe Query Execution**

```elixir
def get_user_by_email(email) do
  from(u in User, where: u.email == ^email)
  |> Repo.one()
end
```

In this example, the `^` operator is used to bind the `email` variable, ensuring it is safely escaped.

**Key Points:**

- **Parameterized Queries**: Automatically escape input data.
- **Avoid Dynamic Queries**: Use Ecto's query syntax to prevent injection.

### Visualizing Input Validation and Sanitization

To better understand the flow of input validation and sanitization, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Receive User Input] --> B[Cast Input with Changeset];
  B --> C{Valid?};
  C -->|Yes| D[Sanitize Input];
  C -->|No| E[Return Error];
  D --> F[Process Data Safely];
  E --> G[Log Error and Notify User];
```

**Diagram Description:** This flowchart illustrates the process of receiving user input, casting and validating it with a changeset, sanitizing it, and then processing it safely. If validation fails, an error is returned, logged, and the user is notified.
