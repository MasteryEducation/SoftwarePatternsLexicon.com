## 7.7. Memento Pattern for State Preservation

In the realm of software design patterns, the Memento Pattern plays a crucial role in capturing and restoring the state of an object without violating encapsulation. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo functionality or rollback operations after errors. In this section, we will delve into the Memento Pattern, explore its implementation in Elixir, and examine its use cases and benefits.

### Capturing and Restoring Object State

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture an object's internal state and store it externally so that the object can be restored to this state later. This is done without exposing the object's internal structure, thereby preserving encapsulation.

#### Intent

The primary intent of the Memento Pattern is to provide a way to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. This is particularly useful for implementing features like undo, redo, and rollback.

#### Key Participants

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. **Memento**: The object that stores the state of the Originator.
3. **Caretaker**: The object responsible for keeping track of the Memento.

### Implementing the Memento Pattern in Elixir

In Elixir, the Memento Pattern can be implemented using various techniques, including storing process state snapshots in ETS (Erlang Term Storage) or using external storage solutions. Let's explore a basic implementation of the Memento Pattern in Elixir.

#### Sample Code Snippet

Below is a simple implementation of the Memento Pattern in Elixir. In this example, we will create a module that represents the Originator, a struct for the Memento, and a Caretaker module to manage the state.

```elixir
defmodule Originator do
  defstruct state: nil

  # Function to create a new originator with a given state
  def new(state), do: %Originator{state: state}

  # Function to set a new state
  def set_state(originator, state), do: %Originator{originator | state: state}

  # Function to get the current state
  def get_state(%Originator{state: state}), do: state

  # Function to save the current state to a memento
  def save_to_memento(originator), do: %Memento{state: originator.state}

  # Function to restore the state from a memento
  def restore_from_memento(originator, %Memento{state: state}), do: %Originator{originator | state: state}
end

defmodule Memento do
  defstruct state: nil
end

defmodule Caretaker do
  defstruct mementos: []

  # Function to add a memento to the caretaker
  def add_memento(caretaker, memento), do: %Caretaker{caretaker | mementos: [memento | caretaker.mementos]}

  # Function to get the last saved memento
  def get_last_memento(%Caretaker{mementos: [last | _]}), do: last
end

# Example usage
originator = Originator.new("Initial State")
caretaker = %Caretaker{}

# Save the current state
memento = Originator.save_to_memento(originator)
caretaker = Caretaker.add_memento(caretaker, memento)

# Change the state
originator = Originator.set_state(originator, "New State")

# Restore the state
last_memento = Caretaker.get_last_memento(caretaker)
originator = Originator.restore_from_memento(originator, last_memento)

IO.inspect Originator.get_state(originator) # Output: "Initial State"
```

In this example, the `Originator` module represents the object whose state we want to save and restore. The `Memento` struct is used to store the state, and the `Caretaker` module manages the mementos.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Memento Pattern in Elixir, consider the following:

- **State Size**: Be mindful of the size of the state being saved. Large states can consume significant memory and storage resources.
- **Performance**: Saving and restoring state can be resource-intensive. Optimize the process to minimize performance impact.
- **Concurrency**: Elixir's concurrency model can complicate state management. Ensure that state changes are thread-safe and consistent.

### Elixir Unique Features

Elixir offers several unique features that can enhance the implementation of the Memento Pattern:

- **Immutability**: Elixir's immutable data structures ensure that state changes do not affect other parts of the system, making it easier to manage state.
- **Concurrency**: Elixir's lightweight processes and message-passing model facilitate concurrent state management.
- **ETS**: Erlang Term Storage (ETS) can be used to store mementos efficiently, providing fast access to state snapshots.

### Use Cases

The Memento Pattern is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **Undo Functionality**: Implementing undo and redo operations in applications such as text editors and graphic design tools.
- **State Rollback**: Rolling back to a previous state after an error or failure, ensuring system stability.
- **Version Control**: Managing different versions of an object's state, similar to version control systems.

### Differences and Similarities

The Memento Pattern is often compared to other state management patterns, such as the Command Pattern and the State Pattern. While these patterns share some similarities, they serve different purposes:

- **Command Pattern**: Focuses on encapsulating requests as objects, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, encapsulating state-specific behavior.

### Visualizing the Memento Pattern

To better understand the Memento Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the Originator, Memento, and Caretaker using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Originator
    participant Memento
    participant Caretaker

    Originator->>Memento: Save State
    Caretaker->>Memento: Store Memento
    Originator->>Caretaker: Request Last Memento
    Caretaker->>Memento: Retrieve Last Memento
    Memento->>Originator: Restore State
```

This diagram illustrates the process of saving and restoring state using the Memento Pattern. The Originator saves its state to a Memento, which is then stored by the Caretaker. When the Originator needs to restore its state, it requests the last Memento from the Caretaker.

### Try It Yourself

To gain a deeper understanding of the Memento Pattern, try modifying the code example provided above. Experiment with different state values, add additional mementos, and implement a redo functionality. This hands-on approach will help solidify your understanding of the pattern.
