## 4.6. Using Structs and Protocols

In the world of Elixir, structs and protocols are powerful tools that allow developers to model data and implement polymorphic behavior in a clean and efficient manner. This section delves into the intricacies of using structs and protocols, providing you with the knowledge to leverage these features in your Elixir applications.

### Data Modeling with Structs

Structs in Elixir are a way to define custom data types with named fields. They are built on top of maps, providing a way to enforce a specific structure for your data. Structs are immutable, like all data in Elixir, and they come with a set of default values.

#### Defining Clear Contracts for Data Types

When you define a struct, you are essentially creating a contract for your data. This contract specifies the fields that must be present and their default values. Here's how you can define a struct in Elixir:

```elixir
defmodule User do
  defstruct name: "Anonymous", age: 0, email: nil
end
```

In this example, we define a `User` struct with three fields: `name`, `age`, and `email`. Each field has a default value, which can be overridden when creating an instance of the struct.

#### Creating and Using Structs

To create an instance of a struct, you use the `%StructName{}` syntax:

```elixir
# Creating a User struct with default values
default_user = %User{}

# Creating a User struct with custom values
custom_user = %User{name: "Alice", age: 30, email: "alice@example.com"}
```

Structs provide a way to ensure that your data adheres to a specific format, making your code more predictable and easier to maintain.

#### Accessing and Updating Struct Fields

You can access and update fields in a struct using the dot notation:

```elixir
# Accessing fields
IO.puts(custom_user.name)  # Output: Alice

# Updating fields
updated_user = %User{custom_user | age: 31}
```

Remember, structs are immutable, so updating a field creates a new struct with the updated value.

### Polymorphism with Protocols

Protocols in Elixir provide a mechanism for polymorphism, allowing you to write generic code that can work with different data types. They are similar to interfaces in other languages but are more flexible and dynamic.

#### Writing Generic Code with Protocols

Protocols define a set of functions that must be implemented by any data type that wants to conform to the protocol. Here's an example of defining a simple protocol:

```elixir
defprotocol Describable do
  @doc "Returns a description of the data"
  def describe(data)
end
```

This `Describable` protocol requires implementing a `describe/1` function that returns a description of the data.

#### Implementing Protocols

To implement a protocol for a specific data type, you use the `defimpl` macro. Let's implement the `Describable` protocol for the `User` struct:

```elixir
defimpl Describable, for: User do
  def describe(user) do
    "User: #{user.name}, Age: #{user.age}, Email: #{user.email}"
  end
end
```

Now, you can call the `describe/1` function on any `User` struct:

```elixir
IO.puts(Describable.describe(custom_user))  # Output: User: Alice, Age: 30, Email: alice@example.com
```

#### Built-in Protocols: `Enumerable` and `String.Chars`

Elixir comes with several built-in protocols, such as `Enumerable` and `String.Chars`, which you can implement for your custom data types.

##### Implementing the `Enumerable` Protocol

The `Enumerable` protocol allows you to make your data type enumerable, enabling it to work with functions like `Enum.map/2` and `Enum.reduce/3`. Here's how you might implement it for a custom collection:

```elixir
defmodule MyCollection do
  defstruct items: []

  defimpl Enumerable do
    def count(%MyCollection{items: items}), do: {:ok, length(items)}
    def member?(%MyCollection{items: items}, value), do: {:ok, value in items}
    def reduce(%MyCollection{items: items}, acc, fun), do: Enum.reduce(items, acc, fun)
  end
end
```

##### Implementing the `String.Chars` Protocol

The `String.Chars` protocol is used to convert a data type to a string. Implementing this protocol allows you to use the `to_string/1` function:

```elixir
defimpl String.Chars, for: User do
  def to_string(user) do
    "User: #{user.name}"
  end
end

IO.puts(to_string(custom_user))  # Output: User: Alice
```

### Custom Protocols

Creating custom protocols allows you to define your own set of functions that different data types can implement. This is particularly useful when you want to enforce a specific behavior across multiple modules.

#### Example: A Custom Protocol for Logging

Let's create a custom protocol for logging data:

```elixir
defprotocol Loggable do
  @doc "Logs the data"
  def log(data)
end

defimpl Loggable, for: User do
  def log(user) do
    IO.puts("Logging user: #{user.name}")
  end
end
```

With this `Loggable` protocol, any data type that implements it can be logged using the `log/1` function.

### Visualizing Structs and Protocols

To better understand how structs and protocols work together, let's visualize their relationship using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        -String name
        -Integer age
        -String email
        +describe() String
    }

    class Describable {
        <<interface>>
        +describe(data) String
    }

    User --|> Describable
```

In this diagram, the `User` struct implements the `Describable` protocol, providing a concrete implementation of the `describe/1` function.

### Design Considerations

When using structs and protocols, consider the following:

- **Use Structs for Data Integrity**: Structs are ideal for ensuring data integrity and providing a clear contract for your data types.
- **Leverage Protocols for Flexibility**: Protocols allow you to write flexible and reusable code by defining a set of functions that different data types can implement.
- **Avoid Overuse**: While protocols are powerful, overusing them can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code. Use them judiciously to solve specific problems.

### Elixir Unique Features

Elixir's approach to structs and protocols is unique in several ways:

- **Immutability**: Both structs and protocols embrace Elixir's immutable nature, ensuring that data remains consistent and predictable.
- **Dynamic Dispatch**: Protocols provide dynamic dispatch, allowing you to write polymorphic code without the need for inheritance or complex type hierarchies.
- **Integration with the BEAM**: Elixir's structs and protocols are designed to work seamlessly with the BEAM VM, providing efficient and performant data handling.

### Differences and Similarities

Structs and protocols are often compared to classes and interfaces in object-oriented languages. However, there are key differences:

- **Structs vs. Classes**: Structs are simpler and more lightweight than classes, focusing on data rather than behavior.
- **Protocols vs. Interfaces**: Protocols offer more flexibility than interfaces, allowing for dynamic dispatch and implementation for existing data types.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with structs and protocols by modifying the examples provided. Try adding new fields to the `User` struct or implementing additional protocols. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding and help you master these powerful Elixir features.
