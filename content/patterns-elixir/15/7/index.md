## 15.7. Presence and Trackable Users

In the realm of modern web applications, real-time user interaction is a cornerstone of engaging user experiences. Whether it's a chat application, a collaborative document editor, or an online gaming platform, knowing who is online and what they are doing is crucial. In this section, we will delve into the **Presence** module in Elixir's Phoenix Framework, which provides a robust solution for tracking user presence and activity in real-time.

### Introduction to Presence in Phoenix

The Phoenix Framework, a powerful tool for building scalable and maintainable web applications, offers a built-in **Presence** module that simplifies the task of tracking users. This module is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates about user status, such as online indicators or active user lists.

#### Key Concepts

- **Presence Tracking**: The ability to monitor when users join or leave a channel, providing real-time updates to other users.
- **User Metadata**: Information associated with a user, such as their username, status, or any other custom data.
- **Distributed Tracking**: Ensuring that presence information is consistent across multiple nodes in a distributed system.

### Setting Up Presence in a Phoenix Application

To get started with Presence in Phoenix, you need to set up a Phoenix application with channels. Channels are the backbone of real-time communication in Phoenix, allowing you to push updates to clients over WebSockets.

#### Step 1: Create a Phoenix Project

First, create a new Phoenix project if you haven't already:

```bash
mix phx.new presence_demo
cd presence_demo
```

#### Step 2: Generate a Channel

Next, generate a channel where users will connect:

```bash
mix phx.gen.channel Room
```

This command creates a new channel module, `RoomChannel`, where we will implement our presence logic.

#### Step 3: Implement Presence in the Channel

In the `RoomChannel` module, we will use the `Phoenix.Presence` module to track users. Here's a basic implementation:

```elixir
defmodule PresenceDemoWeb.RoomChannel do
  use PresenceDemoWeb, :channel
  alias PresenceDemoWeb.Presence

  def join("room:lobby", _message, socket) do
    send(self(), :after_join)
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
    Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
      online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:seconds))
    })
    push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket))
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

- **Presence.track/3**: This function is used to track a user, associating them with a unique identifier and metadata.
- **Presence.list/1**: Retrieves the current presence information for all users in the channel.

### Visualizing Presence with Diagrams

To better understand how presence tracking works, let's visualize the flow of user presence in a Phoenix application.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant PhoenixServer
    participant PresenceModule

    User->>PhoenixServer: Connect to Channel
    PhoenixServer->>PresenceModule: Track User
    PresenceModule->>PhoenixServer: Update Presence State
    PhoenixServer->>User: Push Presence State
    User->>PhoenixServer: Disconnect
    PhoenixServer->>PresenceModule: Untrack User
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a user, the Phoenix server, and the Presence module. When a user connects, they are tracked, and their presence state is updated and pushed to other users. Upon disconnection, they are untracked.

### Advanced Features of Presence

The Presence module offers several advanced features that make it a powerful tool for real-time applications.

#### Detecting Joins and Leaves

Presence can automatically detect when users join or leave a channel, allowing you to update the UI in real-time.

```elixir
def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
  Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
    online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:seconds))
  })
  push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket))
  {:noreply, socket}
end

def handle_out("presence_diff", diff, socket) do
  push(socket, "presence_diff", diff)
  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

- **handle_out/3**: This callback is used to handle presence diffs, which are changes in the presence state, such as users joining or leaving.

#### User Metadata

You can attach metadata to each user, which can be used to display additional information, such as their status or role.

```elixir
Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
  online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:seconds)),
  username: socket.assigns.username
})
```

### Applications of Presence

The Presence module can be used in a variety of applications to enhance user experience.

#### Online Indicators

Display online/offline status for users in a chat application or social network.

#### Active User Lists

Show a list of currently active users in a collaborative document editor or online game.

### Code Example: Building a Real-Time Chat Application

Let's build a simple real-time chat application using the Presence module to track online users.

#### Step 1: Set Up the Channel

First, set up a channel for the chat room:

```elixir
defmodule ChatAppWeb.ChatChannel do
  use ChatAppWeb, :channel
  alias ChatAppWeb.Presence

  def join("chat:lobby", _message, socket) do
    send(self(), :after_join)
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
    Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
      username: socket.assigns.username
    })
    push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket))
    {:noreply, socket}
  end

  def handle_out("presence_diff", diff, socket) do
    push(socket, "presence_diff", diff)
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

#### Step 2: Update the Client

On the client side, listen for presence updates and update the UI accordingly.

```javascript
let presence = {}

let onJoin = (id, current, newPres) => {
  if (!current) {
    console.log("User joined:", newPres.metas[0].username)
  }
}

let onLeave = (id, current, leftPres) => {
  console.log("User left:", leftPres.metas[0].username)
}

let onSync = () => {
  console.log("Presence state synced:", presence)
}

let channel = socket.channel("chat:lobby", {})
channel.join()
  .receive("ok", resp => { console.log("Joined successfully", resp) })
  .receive("error", resp => { console.log("Unable to join", resp) })

channel.on("presence_state", state => {
  presence = Presence.syncState(presence, state)
  onSync()
})

channel.on("presence_diff", diff => {
  presence = Presence.syncDiff(presence, diff)
  onJoin()
  onLeave()
})
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing presence tracking, consider the following:

- **Scalability**: Ensure your application can handle a large number of concurrent users.
- **Consistency**: In a distributed system, ensure presence information is consistent across nodes.
- **Security**: Protect user data and ensure only authorized users can access presence information.

### Elixir Unique Features

Elixir's concurrency model, based on the Actor model, makes it particularly well-suited for real-time applications. The Presence module leverages this model to efficiently track users across distributed systems.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

Presence tracking is often confused with session management. While both involve tracking users, presence focuses on real-time status updates, whereas session management deals with user authentication and authorization.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples to:

- Add additional metadata, such as user roles or avatars.
- Implement a feature that notifies users when a specific friend comes online.
- Scale the application to handle thousands of concurrent users.
