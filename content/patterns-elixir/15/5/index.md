## 15.5. Templating with EEx and Phoenix Templates

In the world of web development, creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces is crucial. Elixir, with its Phoenix framework, offers a powerful templating system that allows developers to build robust web applications. This section will delve into the intricacies of templating in Elixir using Embedded Elixir (EEx) and Phoenix Templates. We will explore writing dynamic templates, rendering views, and creating reusable layout structures and components.

### Embedded Elixir (EEx)

Embedded Elixir (EEx) is a templating engine that allows you to embed Elixir code within a text document. This is particularly useful for generating HTML dynamically. EEx provides a simple and efficient way to create templates that can include logic and dynamic content.

#### Writing Dynamic Templates with Elixir Code Embedded

EEx templates are essentially text files with embedded Elixir code. The code is enclosed within `<%= %>` for expressions that return values and `<% %>` for control structures that do not return values. Let's look at a basic example:

```elixir
# greeting.eex
<%= if user do %>
  Hello, <%= user.name %>!
<% else %>
  Hello, Guest!
<% end %>
```

In this example, we use an `if` statement to check if a `user` is present. If so, we greet the user by name; otherwise, we greet a guest. The `<%= %>` tags are used to output the result of the expression.

#### EEx Syntax and Usage

EEx provides several constructs for embedding Elixir code:

- **Expressions**: Use `<%= expression %>` to evaluate and output the result.
- **Control Structures**: Use `<% control_structure %>` for logic without output.
- **Comments**: Use `<%# comment %>` to add comments that won't appear in the output.

Here's a more complex example demonstrating loops and conditionals:

```elixir
# list.eex
<ul>
<%= for item <- items do %>
  <li><%= item %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>
```

This template generates an unordered list from a list of items. The `for` loop iterates over each item, embedding it within a list item (`<li>`).

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with EEx by creating a template that displays a list of products with their prices. Add a conditional to highlight products on sale.

### Rendering Views

In Phoenix, views are responsible for preparing data for templates. They act as the intermediary between the controller and the template, ensuring that the data is in the correct format for rendering.

#### Using View Modules to Prepare Data for Templates

Phoenix views are modules that contain functions to transform and prepare data. By convention, views are named after the corresponding controller, with a `View` suffix. For example, a `ProductController` would have a `ProductView`.

Here's a simple example of a view module:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.ProductView do
  use MyAppWeb, :view

  def format_price(price) do
    "$#{Float.round(price, 2)}"
  end
end
```

In this example, the `format_price/1` function formats a price as a string with two decimal places. This function can be used in templates to display prices consistently.

#### Rendering Templates with Views

To render a template with a view, you typically use the `render/3` function in the controller. Here's an example:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.ProductController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller

  def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do
    product = MyApp.get_product!(id)
    render(conn, "show.html", product: product)
  end
end
```

In this example, the `show/2` action retrieves a product and renders the `show.html` template, passing the product as an assign.

#### Try It Yourself

Create a view module with a function that formats dates. Use this function in a template to display the creation date of a product.

### Layout and Components

Layouts and components are essential for creating reusable and consistent UI elements across your application. Phoenix provides powerful tools to manage these elements efficiently.

#### Creating Reusable Layout Structures

Layouts in Phoenix are templates that wrap around other templates. They typically contain common elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars. By default, Phoenix uses a layout located at `lib/my_app_web/templates/layout/app.html.eex`.

Here's a basic layout example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title><%= @page_title || "MyApp" %></title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/css/app.css") %>">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to MyApp</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <%= render @view_module, @view_template, assigns %>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2024 MyApp</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

In this layout, the `render/3` function is used to render the current view's template within the `<main>` section.

#### Creating Reusable Components

Components in Phoenix are small, reusable pieces of UI. They can be implemented as partial templates or as functions in view modules.

##### Partial Templates

Partial templates are small templates that can be included in other templates using the `render/3` function. For example, a navigation bar can be a partial template:

```elixir
# nav.html.eex
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="<%= Routes.page_path(@conn, :index) %>">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="<%= Routes.product_path(@conn, :index) %>">Products</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

You can include this partial in your layout or other templates:

```elixir
<%= render "nav.html", assigns %>
```

##### View Functions as Components

View functions can also serve as components, encapsulating logic and rendering HTML. Here's an example of a simple component function:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.SharedView do
  use MyAppWeb, :view

  def render_button(text, url) do
    ~E"""
    <a href="<%= url %>" class="button"><%= text %></a>
    """
  end
end
```

This function generates a button with the specified text and URL. You can use it in templates like this:

```elixir
<%= MyAppWeb.SharedView.render_button("Click Me", "#") %>
```

#### Try It Yourself

Create a partial template for a footer and include it in your layout. Then, create a view function that renders a card component with a title and content.

### Visualizing Templating Workflow

To better understand how templating works in Phoenix, let's visualize the workflow using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Controller] -->|Fetches Data| B[View Module]
    B -->|Prepares Data| C[Template]
    C -->|Renders HTML| D[Layout]
    D -->|Wraps Content| E[Browser]
```

**Diagram Description:** This diagram illustrates the flow of data from the controller to the view module, where it is prepared for the template. The template renders the HTML, which is then wrapped by the layout and sent to the browser.
