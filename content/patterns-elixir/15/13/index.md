## 15.13. Testing Phoenix Applications

Testing is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring that applications behave as expected and are free from defects. In the world of Elixir and the Phoenix framework, testing is not just a best practice but a necessity for building reliable, maintainable, and scalable web applications. In this section, we will explore the various testing strategies available for Phoenix applications, focusing on unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.

### Unit Testing

Unit testing is the foundation of any testing strategy. It involves testing individual components of an application in isolation to ensure they function correctly. In Phoenix applications, unit testing typically covers controllers, views, and channels.

#### Writing Tests for Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests, processing them, and returning responses. Testing controllers involves verifying that they correctly handle different request scenarios, such as valid inputs, invalid inputs, and edge cases.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.UserControllerTest do
  use MyAppWeb.ConnCase, async: true

  alias MyApp.Accounts
  alias MyApp.Accounts.User

  @valid_attrs %{name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com"}
  @invalid_attrs %{name: nil, email: nil}

  test "creates user and redirects when data is valid", %{conn: conn} do
    conn = post(conn, Routes.user_path(conn, :create), user: @valid_attrs)
    assert redirected_to(conn) == Routes.user_path(conn, :index)
    assert Accounts.get_user_by_email("john@example.com")
  end

  test "does not create user and renders errors when data is invalid", %{conn: conn} do
    conn = post(conn, Routes.user_path(conn, :create), user: @invalid_attrs)
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "can't be blank"
  end
end
```

In this example, we use `ConnCase` to set up the test environment. We test the `create` action of the `UserController` to ensure it behaves correctly with valid and invalid data.

#### Writing Tests for Views

Views in Phoenix are responsible for rendering templates. Testing views involves verifying that the correct data is passed to the templates and that the templates render the expected HTML.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.UserViewTest do
  use MyAppWeb.ConnCase, async: true

  alias MyAppWeb.UserView

  test "renders user.json" do
    user = %{id: 123, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com"}
    rendered = UserView.render("user.json", user: user)
    assert rendered == %{
      id: 123,
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "john@example.com"
    }
  end
end
```

Here, we test the `UserView` to ensure it correctly renders a user as JSON. This type of testing is crucial for APIs where the response format must be precise.

#### Writing Tests for Channels

Channels in Phoenix enable real-time communication between the server and clients. Testing channels involves simulating client-server interactions and verifying that messages are correctly broadcasted and received.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.UserChannelTest do
  use MyAppWeb.ChannelCase, async: true

  alias MyAppWeb.UserChannel

  setup do
    {:ok, _, socket} =
      UserSocket
      |> socket("user_id", %{some: :assign})
      |> subscribe_and_join(UserChannel, "user:lobby")

    {:ok, socket: socket}
  end

  test "broadcasts are pushed to the client", %{socket: socket} do
    push(socket, "new_msg", %{"body" => "Hello, World!"})
    assert_broadcast "new_msg", %{"body" => "Hello, World!"}
  end
end
```

In this example, we test the `UserChannel` to ensure that messages sent by the client are correctly broadcasted to other clients.

### Integration Testing

Integration testing involves testing the interaction between different components of an application. In Phoenix, integration testing often involves simulating HTTP requests and verifying the entire request-response cycle.

#### Using `Phoenix.ConnTest` for Request-Response Cycles

`Phoenix.ConnTest` is a powerful tool for simulating HTTP requests in tests. It allows us to test the entire stack, from the router to the controller, and verify the response.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.PageControllerTest do
  use MyAppWeb.ConnCase, async: true

  test "GET / renders the index page", %{conn: conn} do
    conn = get(conn, "/")
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Welcome to Phoenix!"
  end

  test "GET /about renders the about page", %{conn: conn} do
    conn = get(conn, "/about")
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "About Us"
  end
end
```

In this example, we use `get/2` to simulate GET requests to the root and about pages of our application. We then verify that the responses contain the expected content.

### Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing involves testing the application from the user's perspective. It typically involves automating browser interactions to ensure the application behaves correctly in real-world scenarios.

#### Automating Browser Interactions with Tools like Wallaby

Wallaby is a popular tool for acceptance testing in Elixir. It allows us to automate browser interactions and verify that the application behaves as expected.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.UserAcceptanceTest do
  use Wallaby.Feature

  feature "user can sign up", %{session: session} do
    session
    |> visit("/sign_up")
    |> fill_in(Query.text_field("Name"), with: "John Doe")
    |> fill_in(Query.text_field("Email"), with: "john@example.com")
    |> click(Query.button("Sign Up"))
    |> assert_has(Query.text("Welcome, John Doe!"))
  end
end
```

In this example, we use Wallaby to automate the process of signing up a new user. We visit the sign-up page, fill in the form, submit it, and verify that the welcome message is displayed.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of testing Phoenix applications, try modifying the examples above. For instance, add more test cases to cover edge scenarios, or experiment with different tools and libraries for acceptance testing.

### Visualizing the Testing Process

To better understand the testing process in Phoenix applications, let's visualize the flow of a typical test suite using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Developer
    participant TestSuite
    participant Application
    participant Database

    Developer->>TestSuite: Run Tests
    TestSuite->>Application: Simulate Request
    Application->>Database: Query Data
    Database-->>Application: Return Data
    Application-->>TestSuite: Return Response
    TestSuite-->>Developer: Display Results
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the developer, test suite, application, and database during the testing process. It highlights the flow of data and the role of each component in ensuring the application behaves as expected.
