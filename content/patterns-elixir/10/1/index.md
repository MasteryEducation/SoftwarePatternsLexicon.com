## 10.1. Introduction to OTP

### What is OTP?

The Open Telecom Platform (OTP) is a collection of middleware, libraries, and tools designed for building robust, concurrent, and distributed systems. Originally developed by Ericsson for telecom applications, OTP has become a cornerstone of the Elixir ecosystem, providing the foundation for building scalable and fault-tolerant applications.

OTP is not just a library; it embodies a set of design principles that guide the development of concurrent applications. These principles are crucial for creating systems that can handle failures gracefully and continue to operate under load.

### Components of OTP

OTP consists of several key components that facilitate the development of robust applications. These components include:

- **Behaviours**: Predefined modules that encapsulate common patterns, such as GenServer, Supervisor, and Application.
- **Libraries**: A set of tools and utilities for building concurrent and distributed systems.
- **Design Principles**: Guidelines for structuring applications to be resilient and maintainable.

#### Behaviours

Behaviours are a central concept in OTP, providing a way to define reusable patterns for common tasks. The most commonly used behaviours in Elixir are:

- **GenServer**: A generic server implementation that abstracts the complexities of process management.
- **Supervisor**: A process that monitors other processes, known as child processes, and restarts them if they fail.
- **Application**: A component that defines the starting point of an OTP application and manages its lifecycle.

### Importance in Elixir

OTP is integral to Elixir's ability to build scalable and fault-tolerant systems. By leveraging OTP, developers can focus on the business logic of their applications while relying on proven patterns for concurrency and fault tolerance.

#### Scalability

OTP provides the tools necessary to build applications that can scale horizontally across multiple nodes. This is achieved through the use of distributed Erlang, which allows processes to communicate seamlessly across nodes.

#### Fault Tolerance

One of the key features of OTP is its ability to handle failures gracefully. Through the use of supervisors and the "let it crash" philosophy, OTP applications can recover from errors without affecting the overall system stability.

### Key Concepts and Terminology

Before diving deeper into OTP, it's important to understand some key concepts and terminology:

- **Process**: The fundamental unit of concurrency in Elixir. Each process runs independently and communicates with other processes via message passing.
- **Node**: An instance of the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM) running on a machine. Nodes can communicate with each other to form a distributed system.
- **Message Passing**: The mechanism by which processes communicate in Elixir. Messages are sent asynchronously and can be received in any order.
- **Supervision Tree**: A hierarchical structure of processes, where supervisors manage the lifecycle of their child processes.

### GenServer: The Generic Server

The GenServer behaviour is one of the most commonly used components of OTP. It provides a framework for implementing server processes that handle requests, maintain state, and perform tasks asynchronously.

#### Key Features of GenServer

- **State Management**: GenServer allows you to maintain state across multiple requests, making it ideal for building stateful services.
- **Synchronous and Asynchronous Calls**: GenServer supports both synchronous (`call`) and asynchronous (`cast`) message handling.
- **Lifecycle Callbacks**: GenServer provides a set of callbacks for managing the lifecycle of a server process, such as `init`, `handle_call`, `handle_cast`, and `terminate`.

#### Example: Implementing a Simple GenServer

Let's implement a simple GenServer that maintains a counter:

```elixir
defmodule Counter do
  use GenServer

  # Client API

  def start_link(initial_value) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_value, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def increment do
    GenServer.cast(__MODULE__, :increment)
  end

  def get_value do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :get_value)
  end

  # Server Callbacks

  def init(initial_value) do
    {:ok, initial_value}
  end

  def handle_cast(:increment, state) do
    {:noreply, state + 1}
  end

  def handle_call(:get_value, _from, state) do
    {:reply, state, state}
  end
end
```

In this example, we define a GenServer module named `Counter` that maintains a simple integer state. The `increment` function sends an asynchronous message to the server to increase the counter, while the `get_value` function retrieves the current value synchronously.

### Supervisor: Ensuring Fault Tolerance

Supervisors are responsible for monitoring and managing the lifecycle of other processes. They implement strategies for restarting child processes when they fail, ensuring that the system remains stable and resilient.

#### Supervision Strategies

Supervisors support several strategies for managing child processes:

- **One for One**: If a child process terminates, only that process is restarted.
- **One for All**: If a child process terminates, all other child processes are terminated and restarted.
- **Rest for One**: If a child process terminates, the rest of the child processes started after it are terminated and restarted.

#### Example: Setting Up a Supervisor

Let's set up a supervisor for our `Counter` GenServer:

```elixir
defmodule CounterSupervisor do
  use Supervisor

  def start_link do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def init(:ok) do
    children = [
      {Counter, 0}
    ]

    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

In this example, we define a supervisor module named `CounterSupervisor` that supervises the `Counter` GenServer. We use the `one_for_one` strategy, which means that if the `Counter` process crashes, only it will be restarted.

### Application: Managing the Lifecycle

The Application behaviour is used to define the starting point of an OTP application and manage its lifecycle. It provides a way to specify which processes should be started when the application is launched.

#### Example: Defining an OTP Application

Let's define an OTP application that starts our `CounterSupervisor`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      CounterSupervisor
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

In this example, we define an application module named `MyApp.Application` that starts the `CounterSupervisor` when the application is launched.

### Visualizing OTP Components

To better understand the relationships between the various OTP components, let's visualize them using a diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Application] --> B[Supervisor];
    B --> C[GenServer];
    B --> D[GenServer];
```

This diagram illustrates a simple OTP application structure, where an `Application` starts a `Supervisor`, which in turn manages multiple `GenServer` processes.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of OTP, try experimenting with the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions for modifications:

- Add a new function to the `Counter` GenServer that decrements the counter.
- Implement a new GenServer that maintains a list of items and supports adding and removing items.
- Experiment with different supervision strategies in the `CounterSupervisor`.
