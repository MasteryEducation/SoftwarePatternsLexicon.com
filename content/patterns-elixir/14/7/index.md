## 14.7. GraphQL APIs with Absinthe

GraphQL has emerged as a powerful alternative to REST for building APIs, offering a flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data. In the Elixir ecosystem, Absinthe is the go-to library for implementing GraphQL APIs. This section will guide you through the advanced concepts of building GraphQL APIs with Absinthe, focusing on consuming GraphQL services, schema stitching, and implementing real-time data fetching with subscriptions.

### Introduction to GraphQL and Absinthe

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues common with REST APIs.

Absinthe is a robust GraphQL toolkit for Elixir, designed to help developers build powerful and flexible APIs. It integrates seamlessly with the Elixir ecosystem, leveraging its concurrency model and functional programming paradigm to deliver high-performance GraphQL services.

### Consuming GraphQL Services

To consume GraphQL services, you can use clients like `Absinthe.Plug` to interact with GraphQL APIs. This section will demonstrate how to set up a GraphQL client in Elixir and make queries to a GraphQL server.

#### Setting Up Absinthe.Plug

`Absinthe.Plug` is a library that allows you to mount a GraphQL schema in a Plug application. It acts as a bridge between your Elixir application and the GraphQL server.

```elixir
# Add Absinthe.Plug to your mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    {:absinthe_plug, "~> 1.5"}
  ]
end
```

#### Creating a GraphQL Client

To create a GraphQL client, you need to define a schema and configure the endpoint to handle GraphQL requests.

```elixir
# Define a simple schema
defmodule MyAppWeb.Schema do
  use Absinthe.Schema

  query do
    field :hello, :string do
      resolve fn _, _ ->
        {:ok, "Hello, world!"}
      end
    end
  end
end

# Configure the endpoint
defmodule MyAppWeb.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :my_app

  plug Absinthe.Plug,
    schema: MyAppWeb.Schema

  plug Plug.Logger
  plug Plug.Parsers, parsers: [:urlencoded, :multipart, :json],
                     pass: ["*/*"],
                     json_decoder: Jason

  plug :match
  plug :dispatch
end
```

#### Making GraphQL Queries

With the client set up, you can now make GraphQL queries to fetch data from the server.

```elixir
# Example query
query = """
{
  hello
}
"""

# Send the query to the server
response = MyAppWeb.Endpoint.call(%Plug.Conn{}, :get, "/graphql", query)

IO.inspect(response)
```

### Schema Stitching

Schema stitching is a technique used to combine multiple GraphQL schemas into a single unified schema. This is particularly useful when you have microservices or separate GraphQL APIs that you want to expose as a single API.

#### Implementing Schema Stitching

To implement schema stitching in Absinthe, you can use the `Absinthe.Schema.Notation` module to define and merge schemas.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.StitchedSchema do
  use Absinthe.Schema.Notation

  import_types MyAppWeb.Schema1
  import_types MyAppWeb.Schema2

  query do
    import_fields :schema1_query
    import_fields :schema2_query
  end
end
```

#### Benefits of Schema Stitching

- **Unified API**: Expose multiple services as a single API.
- **Modularity**: Keep schemas modular and maintainable.
- **Reusability**: Reuse types and fields across different schemas.

### Subscriptions

Subscriptions in GraphQL allow clients to receive real-time updates from the server. Absinthe provides robust support for implementing subscriptions, enabling you to build real-time applications with ease.

#### Implementing Subscriptions

To implement subscriptions, you need to define subscription fields in your schema and use a PubSub system to broadcast updates.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Schema do
  use Absinthe.Schema

  subscription do
    field :new_message, :message do
      config fn _, _ ->
        {:ok, topic: "messages"}
      end
    end
  end
end

# Broadcasting updates
MyAppWeb.Endpoint.broadcast("messages", "new_message", %{content: "Hello, world!"})
```

#### Real-Time Data Fetching

Subscriptions enable real-time data fetching, allowing clients to receive updates as soon as they occur.

- **Use Cases**: Chat applications, live sports scores, stock market updates.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce polling and improve performance.

### Visualizing GraphQL with Absinthe

To better understand the flow of data in a GraphQL API built with Absinthe, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AbsinthePlug
    participant GraphQLServer

    Client->>AbsinthePlug: Send GraphQL Query
    AbsinthePlug->>GraphQLServer: Resolve Query
    GraphQLServer-->>AbsinthePlug: Return Data
    AbsinthePlug-->>Client: Send Response
```

**Diagram Description:** This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a client, Absinthe.Plug, and a GraphQL server. The client sends a query to Absinthe.Plug, which resolves the query by communicating with the GraphQL server. The server returns the data, and Absinthe.Plug sends the response back to the client.

### Key Considerations for GraphQL APIs with Absinthe

- **Performance**: Optimize queries and use batching to reduce server load.
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data.
- **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.

### Elixir Unique Features

Elixir's concurrency model and functional programming paradigm make it an excellent choice for building GraphQL APIs. Absinthe leverages these features to deliver high-performance, scalable APIs.

- **Concurrency**: Handle multiple requests simultaneously with lightweight processes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Use OTP principles to build resilient systems.
- **Functional Programming**: Write clean, maintainable code with pure functions and immutability.

### Differences and Similarities with REST

While both GraphQL and REST are used to build APIs, they have key differences:

- **Flexibility**: GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, while REST has fixed endpoints.
- **Efficiency**: GraphQL reduces over-fetching and under-fetching by allowing clients to request only the necessary data.
- **Complexity**: GraphQL can be more complex to implement due to its flexible query language and schema requirements.
