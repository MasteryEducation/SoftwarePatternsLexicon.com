## 14.10. Integrating with Cloud Services

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, integrating with cloud services is a crucial aspect of building scalable, resilient, and efficient applications. Elixir, with its robust concurrency model and functional programming paradigm, offers unique advantages when interacting with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. This section will guide you through the process of integrating Elixir applications with these cloud services, focusing on using SDKs and APIs, managing storage and queues, and ensuring secure authentication.

### Understanding Cloud Integration

Before diving into specifics, it's essential to understand what cloud integration entails. Cloud integration involves connecting various applications, systems, and IT environments for the real-time exchange of data and processes. This integration can be achieved through APIs, SDKs, and other tools provided by cloud service providers.

### Using SDKs and APIs to Interact with Cloud Services

#### AWS Integration

AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that can be accessed via their SDKs and APIs. Elixir developers can leverage the `ex_aws` library, which provides a convenient interface to interact with AWS services.

```elixir
# Example: Listing S3 Buckets using ExAws

defmodule S3Example do
  @moduledoc """
  A module to demonstrate interaction with AWS S3 using ExAws.
  """

  alias ExAws.S3

  def list_buckets do
    S3.list_buckets()
    |> ExAws.request()
    |> handle_response()
  end

  defp handle_response({:ok, %{body: body}}) do
    IO.inspect(body, label: "S3 Buckets")
  end

  defp handle_response({:error, reason}) do
    IO.inspect(reason, label: "Error")
  end
end
```

In this example, we use the `ExAws.S3` module to list all S3 buckets. The `ExAws.request/1` function sends the request to AWS, and the response is handled accordingly.

#### GCP Integration

For Google Cloud Platform, the `goth` library is commonly used to manage authentication and interact with GCP services. Here's how you can authenticate and access Google Cloud Storage:

```elixir
# Example: Authenticating with GCP and Accessing Cloud Storage

defmodule GCPExample do
  @moduledoc """
  A module to demonstrate interaction with Google Cloud Storage.
  """

  alias Goth.Token
  alias GoogleApi.Storage.V1.Connection
  alias GoogleApi.Storage.V1.Api.Objects

  def list_objects(bucket_name) do
    {:ok, token} = Token.for_scope("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only")
    conn = Connection.new(token.token)

    Objects.storage_objects_list(conn, bucket_name)
    |> handle_response()
  end

  defp handle_response({:ok, response}) do
    IO.inspect(response, label: "GCP Storage Objects")
  end

  defp handle_response({:error, reason}) do
    IO.inspect(reason, label: "Error")
  end
end
```

This example demonstrates how to authenticate with GCP using `goth` and list objects in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

#### Azure Integration

Azure provides the `azure` library for Elixir, which can be used to interact with Azure services. Here's an example of how to list blobs in an Azure Storage account:

```elixir
# Example: Listing Azure Storage Blobs

defmodule AzureExample do
  @moduledoc """
  A module to demonstrate interaction with Azure Storage.
  """

  alias Azure.Storage.Blob

  def list_blobs(container_name) do
    Blob.list_blobs(container_name)
    |> handle_response()
  end

  defp handle_response({:ok, blobs}) do
    IO.inspect(blobs, label: "Azure Storage Blobs")
  end

  defp handle_response({:error, reason}) do
    IO.inspect(reason, label: "Error")
  end
end
```

This code snippet shows how to list blobs in a specified Azure Storage container using the `azure` library.

### Storage and Queues

#### Integrating with S3 and Cloud Storage

Cloud storage services like AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage are essential for storing and retrieving large amounts of data. Elixir's concurrency model makes it particularly well-suited for handling multiple storage operations simultaneously.

```elixir
# Example: Uploading a File to AWS S3

defmodule S3UploadExample do
  @moduledoc """
  A module to demonstrate file upload to AWS S3.
  """

  alias ExAws.S3

  def upload_file(bucket, file_path) do
    file_content = File.read!(file_path)
    S3.put_object(bucket, Path.basename(file_path), file_content)
    |> ExAws.request()
    |> handle_response()
  end

  defp handle_response({:ok, _response}) do
    IO.puts("File uploaded successfully!")
  end

  defp handle_response({:error, reason}) do
    IO.inspect(reason, label: "Error")
  end
end
```

This example demonstrates how to upload a file to an S3 bucket using `ExAws`.

#### Message Queues like SQS

Message queues are crucial for building decoupled and scalable systems. AWS SQS and similar services on GCP and Azure can be integrated with Elixir applications to handle asynchronous message processing.

```elixir
# Example: Sending a Message to AWS SQS

defmodule SQSExample do
  @moduledoc """
  A module to demonstrate sending a message to AWS SQS.
  """

  alias ExAws.SQS

  def send_message(queue_url, message_body) do
    SQS.send_message(queue_url, message_body)
    |> ExAws.request()
    |> handle_response()
  end

  defp handle_response({:ok, _response}) do
    IO.puts("Message sent successfully!")
  end

  defp handle_response({:error, reason}) do
    IO.inspect(reason, label: "Error")
  end
end
```

This code snippet shows how to send a message to an AWS SQS queue using `ExAws`.

### Authentication

#### Managing Credentials and Secure Access

Security is a paramount concern when integrating with cloud services. Elixir provides several libraries and best practices for managing credentials and ensuring secure access.

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like API keys and secrets in environment variables.
- **Vault**: Use HashiCorp Vault for managing secrets and credentials securely.
- **IAM Roles**: Leverage IAM roles and policies to control access to cloud resources.

```elixir
# Example: Using Environment Variables for AWS Credentials

defmodule ConfigExample do
  @moduledoc """
  A module to demonstrate secure configuration using environment variables.
  """

  def get_aws_credentials do
    %{
      access_key_id: System.get_env("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
      secret_access_key: System.get_env("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
    }
  end
end
```

This example shows how to retrieve AWS credentials from environment variables, ensuring they are not hard-coded in the application.

### Visualizing Cloud Integration

To better understand how Elixir applications interact with cloud services, let's visualize a typical architecture using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ElixirApp
    participant AWS
    participant GCP
    participant Azure

    ElixirApp->>AWS: Authenticate and List S3 Buckets
    AWS-->>ElixirApp: Return Bucket List

    ElixirApp->>GCP: Authenticate and List Storage Objects
    GCP-->>ElixirApp: Return Object List

    ElixirApp->>Azure: Authenticate and List Storage Blobs
    Azure-->>ElixirApp: Return Blob List

    ElixirApp->>AWS: Send Message to SQS
    AWS-->>ElixirApp: Confirm Message Sent
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between an Elixir application and various cloud services, highlighting the authentication and data retrieval processes.
