## 14.3. Communicating with External Services

In today's interconnected world, applications rarely operate in isolation. They often need to communicate with external services, whether it's to fetch data, send notifications, or interact with third-party APIs. Elixir, with its robust concurrency model and functional programming paradigm, offers powerful tools and libraries to facilitate these interactions. In this section, we'll explore how to effectively communicate with external services using HTTP clients, WebSockets, and best practices for error handling and retries.

### HTTP Clients

HTTP is the backbone of web communication, and Elixir provides several libraries to make HTTP requests seamless and efficient. Two popular libraries for handling HTTP requests in Elixir are `HTTPoison` and `Tesla`.

#### Using `HTTPoison` for RESTful Interactions

`HTTPoison` is a widely-used HTTP client for Elixir, built on top of the `hackney` library. It provides a simple and intuitive API for making HTTP requests.

**Installation**

To get started with `HTTPoison`, add it to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:httpoison, "~> 1.8"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` to fetch the dependency.

**Making Requests**

Here's a basic example of making a GET request using `HTTPoison`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.HttpClient do
  def fetch_data(url) do
    case HTTPoison.get(url) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: body}} ->
        {:ok, body}

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code}} ->
        {:error, "Request failed with status code: #{status_code}"}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} ->
        {:error, "Request failed due to: #{reason}"}
    end
  end
end
```

**Handling JSON Responses**

Often, the response from an HTTP request is in JSON format. You can use the `Jason` library to parse JSON responses:

```elixir
defp parse_json_response(body) do
  case Jason.decode(body) do
    {:ok, json} -> {:ok, json}
    {:error, _} -> {:error, "Failed to parse JSON"}
  end
end
```

**Try It Yourself**

Experiment with modifying the `fetch_data` function to handle different HTTP methods like POST, PUT, and DELETE. You can also try adding headers or query parameters to your requests.

#### Using `Tesla` for RESTful Interactions

`Tesla` is another powerful HTTP client for Elixir, known for its middleware architecture, which allows you to customize and extend its functionality.

**Installation**

Add `Tesla` and an adapter like `hackney` to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:tesla, "~> 1.4"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.17"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` to fetch the dependencies.

**Configuring Tesla**

Here's how you can configure a basic Tesla client:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TeslaClient do
  use Tesla

  plug Tesla.Middleware.BaseUrl, "https://api.example.com"
  plug Tesla.Middleware.JSON

  adapter Tesla.Adapter.Hackney
end
```

**Making Requests**

With Tesla, making a GET request is straightforward:

```elixir
def fetch_data(client, endpoint) do
  case client.get(endpoint) do
    {:ok, %Tesla.Env{status: 200, body: body}} ->
      {:ok, body}

    {:ok, %Tesla.Env{status: status}} ->
      {:error, "Request failed with status code: #{status}"}

    {:error, reason} ->
      {:error, "Request failed due to: #{reason}"}
  end
end
```

**Middleware**

Tesla's middleware system is one of its standout features. You can add middleware for logging, authentication, or custom headers:

```elixir
plug Tesla.Middleware.Logger
plug Tesla.Middleware.Headers, [{"Authorization", "Bearer token"}]
```

**Try It Yourself**

Create a custom middleware in Tesla to handle retries for failed requests. Experiment with different middleware combinations to see how they affect the request flow.

### WebSocket Communication

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, making them ideal for real-time applications. In Elixir, the `websocket_client` library is a popular choice for implementing WebSocket communication.

#### Implementing Real-Time Communication with `websocket_client`

**Installation**

Add `websocket_client` to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:websocket_client, "~> 1.4"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` to fetch the dependency.

**Connecting to a WebSocket Server**

Here's a basic example of connecting to a WebSocket server:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.WebSocketClient do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(url) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, url, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def init(url) do
    {:ok, _pid} = :websocket_client.start_link(url, __MODULE__, %{})
    {:ok, %{}}
  end

  def handle_info({:websocket, :connected}, state) do
    IO.puts("Connected to WebSocket server")
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:websocket, {:text, message}}, state) do
    IO.puts("Received message: #{message}")
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:websocket, :closed}, state) do
    IO.puts("WebSocket connection closed")
    {:stop, :normal, state}
  end
end
```

**Sending and Receiving Messages**

You can send messages to the WebSocket server using the `:websocket_client.send` function:

```elixir
def send_message(pid, message) do
  :websocket_client.send(pid, {:text, message})
end
```

**Try It Yourself**

Modify the `MyApp.WebSocketClient` module to handle binary messages. Experiment with different message types and observe how they are processed.

### Best Practices

When communicating with external services, it's crucial to implement best practices to ensure reliability and robustness.

#### Handling Retries

Implementing retries for failed requests can improve the resilience of your application. Both `HTTPoison` and `Tesla` can be configured to retry requests on failure.

**Example: Retry Logic with Tesla**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RetryMiddleware do
  @behaviour Tesla.Middleware

  def call(env, next, opts) do
    retry(env, next, opts[:retries] || 3)
  end

  defp retry(env, next, retries) when retries > 0 do
    case Tesla.run(env, next) do
      {:ok, result} -> {:ok, result}
      {:error, _} -> retry(env, next, retries - 1)
    end
  end

  defp retry(_, _, 0), do: {:error, "Max retries reached"}
end
```

**Try It Yourself**

Integrate the `MyApp.RetryMiddleware` into your Tesla client and test it with a service that occasionally fails.

#### Handling Timeouts

Timeouts are essential to prevent your application from hanging indefinitely when waiting for a response. Both `HTTPoison` and `Tesla` allow you to specify timeouts.

**Example: Setting Timeouts in HTTPoison**

```elixir
HTTPoison.get(url, [], timeout: 5000, recv_timeout: 5000)
```

**Try It Yourself**

Experiment with different timeout values and observe how they affect the behavior of your application.

#### Error Handling

Proper error handling is crucial when dealing with external services. Always handle potential errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

**Example: Error Handling in Tesla**

```elixir
def fetch_data(client, endpoint) do
  case client.get(endpoint) do
    {:ok, %Tesla.Env{status: 200, body: body}} ->
      {:ok, body}

    {:ok, %Tesla.Env{status: status}} when status in 400..499 ->
      {:error, "Client error: #{status}"}

    {:ok, %Tesla.Env{status: status}} when status in 500..599 ->
      {:error, "Server error: #{status}"}

    {:error, reason} ->
      {:error, "Request failed due to: #{reason}"}
  end
end
```

**Try It Yourself**

Enhance the error handling logic to categorize errors based on their type (e.g., network errors, server errors) and take appropriate actions.

### Visualizing Communication Flow

To better understand the flow of communication with external services, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant HTTPoison
    participant ExternalService

    Client->>HTTPoison: Send HTTP Request
    HTTPoison->>ExternalService: Forward Request
    ExternalService-->>HTTPoison: Send Response
    HTTPoison-->>Client: Forward Response
```

**Diagram Description:** This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of an HTTP request from the client to the external service via `HTTPoison`. The client sends a request, which is forwarded by `HTTPoison` to the external service. The service then sends a response back to `HTTPoison`, which forwards it to the client.
