## 14.6. RESTful Services and HTTP Clients

In today's interconnected world, integrating with external systems through RESTful services is a crucial skill for any software engineer. Elixir, with its robust ecosystem and functional programming paradigm, provides powerful tools for consuming APIs and handling HTTP requests. In this section, we'll explore how to effectively use Elixir to interact with RESTful services, manage authentication, and implement rate limiting strategies.

### Consuming APIs

#### Integrating with External APIs Using HTTP Clients

To interact with RESTful services, we need an HTTP client that can handle requests and responses. In Elixir, the most popular HTTP client libraries are `HTTPoison` and `Tesla`. Let's explore how to use these libraries to consume APIs.

**HTTPoison**

`HTTPoison` is a widely-used HTTP client for Elixir, built on top of the `hackney` library. It provides a simple interface for making HTTP requests.

```elixir
defmodule MyApiClient do
  use HTTPoison.Base

  @base_url "https://api.example.com"

  def get_user(user_id) do
    url = "#{@base_url}/users/#{user_id}"
    case get(url) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: body}} ->
        {:ok, Jason.decode!(body)}
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code}} ->
        {:error, "Received status code #{status_code}"}
      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} ->
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, we define a module `MyApiClient` that uses `HTTPoison.Base` to make a GET request to an external API. We handle different response scenarios, including successful responses and errors.

**Tesla**

`Tesla` is another popular HTTP client in Elixir, known for its middleware architecture, which allows for easy customization of requests and responses.

```elixir
defmodule MyApiClient do
  use Tesla

  plug Tesla.Middleware.BaseUrl, "https://api.example.com"
  plug Tesla.Middleware.JSON

  def get_user(user_id) do
    get("/users/#{user_id}")
  end
end
```

With `Tesla`, we can use middleware to set a base URL and automatically handle JSON encoding and decoding. This makes our code cleaner and more modular.

### Authentication

#### Handling OAuth2, API Keys, and Token-Based Authentication

When consuming APIs, authentication is often required to access protected resources. Let's explore different authentication methods and how to implement them in Elixir.

**OAuth2**

OAuth2 is a common authentication protocol used by many APIs. The `OAuth2` library in Elixir provides a client for handling OAuth2 authentication flows.

```elixir
defmodule MyOAuthClient do
  use OAuth2.Client

  @client_id "your_client_id"
  @client_secret "your_client_secret"
  @redirect_uri "http://localhost:4000/auth/callback"
  @site "https://provider.com"

  def client do
    OAuth2.Client.new([
      strategy: OAuth2.Strategy.AuthCode,
      client_id: @client_id,
      client_secret: @client_secret,
      redirect_uri: @redirect_uri,
      site: @site
    ])
  end

  def authorize_url do
    client()
    |> OAuth2.Client.authorize_url!()
  end

  def get_token(code) do
    client()
    |> OAuth2.Client.get_token!(code: code)
  end
end
```

In this example, we define an OAuth2 client that can generate an authorization URL and exchange an authorization code for an access token.

**API Keys**

Some APIs use API keys for authentication. This is often simpler than OAuth2 and can be implemented by adding the key to the request headers.

```elixir
defmodule MyApiClient do
  use Tesla

  plug Tesla.Middleware.BaseUrl, "https://api.example.com"
  plug Tesla.Middleware.Headers, [{"Authorization", "Bearer your_api_key"}]

  def get_user(user_id) do
    get("/users/#{user_id}")
  end
end
```

**Token-Based Authentication**

Token-based authentication involves obtaining a token from the API and using it in subsequent requests. This can be implemented similarly to API keys.

### Rate Limiting

#### Implementing Back-Off Strategies to Comply with API Limits

When consuming APIs, it's important to respect rate limits to avoid being blocked. Let's explore how to implement back-off strategies in Elixir.

**Exponential Back-Off**

Exponential back-off is a common strategy for handling rate limits. It involves retrying requests with increasing delays.

```elixir
defmodule MyApiClient do
  use HTTPoison.Base

  @base_url "https://api.example.com"

  def get_user(user_id, retries \\ 3) do
    url = "#{@base_url}/users/#{user_id}"
    case get(url) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: body}} ->
        {:ok, Jason.decode!(body)}
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 429}} when retries > 0 ->
        :timer.sleep(:math.pow(2, 3 - retries) * 1000)
        get_user(user_id, retries - 1)
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code}} ->
        {:error, "Received status code #{status_code}"}
      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} ->
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, we implement exponential back-off by retrying the request with increasing delays when a 429 status code (Too Many Requests) is received.

### Visualizing API Integration

To better understand the flow of API integration, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    Client->>API: Send HTTP Request
    API-->>Client: Receive Response
    alt Success
        Client->>Client: Process Response
    else Error
        Client->>Client: Handle Error
    end
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between a client and an API, highlighting the steps involved in sending a request, receiving a response, and handling success or error scenarios.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples to:

- Use a different HTTP client library, such as `Finch`.
- Implement a different authentication method, such as Basic Auth.
- Experiment with different back-off strategies, such as linear back-off.
