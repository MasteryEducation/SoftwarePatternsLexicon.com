## 21.8. Continuous Integration and Deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development, ensuring that code changes are automatically tested and deployed. In this section, we will explore how to set up CI/CD pipelines for Elixir applications, automate builds and tests, and implement deployment automation. We will also discuss best practices to keep your pipelines efficient and reliable.

### Setting Up CI Pipelines

Setting up a CI pipeline involves automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. This is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.

#### Choosing a CI Tool

There are several CI tools available that can be used with Elixir applications, including:

- **Travis CI**: A popular CI service that integrates well with GitHub and offers a straightforward setup for Elixir projects.
- **GitHub Actions**: Provides a flexible way to automate workflows directly within GitHub repositories.
- **CircleCI**: Known for its speed and efficiency, CircleCI offers robust support for Elixir applications.

Let's look at how to set up a basic CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.

#### Setting Up GitHub Actions for Elixir

GitHub Actions allows you to automate your workflow directly within your GitHub repository. Here's a simple example of a GitHub Actions workflow for an Elixir project:

```yaml
name: Elixir CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        elixir: [1.12]
        otp: [24.0]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Elixir
      uses: erlef/setup-beam@v1
      with:
        elixir-version: ${{ matrix.elixir }}
        otp-version: ${{ matrix.otp }}
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: mix deps.get
    - name: Run Tests
      run: mix test
```

**Explanation:**

- **Triggering Events**: The workflow is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
- **Matrix Strategy**: This allows testing against multiple versions of Elixir and OTP.
- **Steps**: The workflow checks out the code, sets up the Elixir environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

### Automated Builds and Tests

Automating builds and tests is a core component of CI. It ensures that every change is validated by running a suite of tests, providing immediate feedback to developers.

#### Running the Test Suite

In Elixir, the `mix test` command is used to run tests. It's crucial to ensure that your test suite is comprehensive and covers all critical paths of your application.

**Example Test File:**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SampleTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  doctest MyApp.Sample

  test "greets the world" do
    assert MyApp.Sample.hello() == :world
  end
end
```

**Key Points:**

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure that your tests cover edge cases and potential failure points.
- **Fast Feedback**: Keep tests fast to provide quick feedback to developers.

### Deployment Automation

Deployment automation involves automatically deploying code changes to staging or production environments after passing all tests. This reduces the risk of human error and speeds up the release process.

#### Implementing Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment (CD) can be achieved by integrating deployment scripts into your CI pipeline. Here's an example of how you might set up a deployment step in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
  run: |
    ssh user@your-server "cd /path/to/app && git pull && mix deps.get && mix compile && mix phx.server"
```

**Explanation:**

- **Conditional Deployment**: The deployment step runs only on pushes to the `main` branch.
- **Remote Execution**: The script connects to a remote server, pulls the latest code, installs dependencies, compiles the application, and starts the server.

### Best Practices

To ensure your CI/CD pipelines are efficient and reliable, consider the following best practices:

- **Keep Pipelines Fast**: Optimize your test suite and build process to minimize execution time.
- **Notify Teams**: Use notifications to alert teams of build status and failures, enabling quick responses to issues.
- **Secure Secrets**: Manage sensitive information like API keys and passwords securely within your CI/CD tool.
- **Monitor Pipeline Performance**: Regularly review pipeline performance and make adjustments to improve efficiency.

### Visualizing CI/CD Workflow

Below is a diagram illustrating a typical CI/CD workflow for an Elixir application:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Code Commit] --> B[CI Pipeline Triggered];
    B --> C[Run Tests];
    C --> D{Tests Passed?};
    D -- Yes --> E[Build Application];
    E --> F{Deploy to Staging};
    F -- Yes --> G[Manual Approval];
    G --> H[Deploy to Production];
    D -- No --> I[Notify Team];
    F -- No --> I;
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Code Commit**: Triggers the CI pipeline.
- **Run Tests**: Executes the test suite.
- **Deploy to Staging**: Deploys the application to a staging environment if tests pass.
- **Manual Approval**: Requires manual approval before deploying to production.
- **Notify Team**: Alerts the team if tests fail or deployment issues occur.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience, try setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a sample Elixir project. Experiment with different CI tools and deployment strategies. Modify the provided GitHub Actions workflow to include additional steps, such as linting or code coverage analysis.
