## 24.8. Case Studies in Regulated Industries

In this section, we delve into the application of Elixir design patterns within regulated industries, focusing on healthcare and financial services. These sectors demand stringent compliance with regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). We will explore how Elixir's features and design patterns can be leveraged to meet these requirements effectively.

### Healthcare Applications

#### Implementing HIPAA-Compliant Features

Healthcare applications must adhere to HIPAA regulations, which mandate the protection of sensitive patient data. Elixir, with its robust concurrency model and fault-tolerant design, is well-suited for building secure and reliable healthcare systems.

**Key Requirements of HIPAA:**

1. **Data Encryption:** Protecting data both at rest and in transit.
2. **Access Control:** Ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
3. **Audit Trails:** Maintaining logs of data access and modifications.
4. **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

**Elixir Design Patterns for HIPAA Compliance:**

- **Supervisor Pattern:** Utilize supervisors to manage processes that handle sensitive data, ensuring they are restarted in case of failure.
- **GenServer for Access Control:** Implement GenServers to manage user sessions and enforce access control policies.
- **ETS for Audit Trails:** Use Erlang Term Storage (ETS) to maintain audit logs, providing fast access and persistence.
- **Encryption Libraries:** Leverage libraries like `Comeonin` and `Argon2` for encrypting sensitive data.

**Code Example: Implementing Access Control with GenServer**

```elixir
defmodule AccessControlServer do
  use GenServer

  # Client API
  def start_link(initial_state) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_state, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def authorize_user(user_id, resource) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:authorize, user_id, resource})
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(initial_state) do
    {:ok, initial_state}
  end

  def handle_call({:authorize, user_id, resource}, _from, state) do
    if authorized?(user_id, resource, state) do
      {:reply, :ok, state}
    else
      {:reply, {:error, :unauthorized}, state}
    end
  end

  defp authorized?(user_id, resource, state) do
    # Implement authorization logic here
    true
  end
end
```

**Try It Yourself:**

- Modify the `authorized?/3` function to implement specific authorization logic based on user roles or permissions.
- Experiment with adding logging to track authorization requests.

**Visualizing HIPAA Compliance in Elixir Applications**

    A[User Request] --> B[AccessControlServer]
    B --> C{Authorized?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Access Granted]
    C -- No --> E[Access Denied]
    D --> F[Log Access]
    E --> F
```

**Diagram Description:** This flowchart illustrates the process of handling user requests in a HIPAA-compliant Elixir application using a GenServer for access control.

### Financial Services

#### Meeting Requirements like PCI DSS

Financial services must comply with PCI DSS to protect cardholder data. Elixir's capabilities in handling concurrent processes and ensuring data integrity make it an ideal choice for developing secure financial applications.

**Key Requirements of PCI DSS:**

1. **Secure Network:** Implementing firewalls and encryption.
2. **Data Protection:** Encrypting cardholder data and maintaining secure storage.
3. **Access Management:** Restricting access to cardholder data.
4. **Monitoring and Testing:** Regularly monitoring networks and testing security systems.

**Elixir Design Patterns for PCI DSS Compliance:**

- **Proxy Pattern with GenServers:** Use GenServers as proxies to manage and secure data transactions.
- **Decorator Pattern for Logging:** Implement decorators to log transactions and monitor access.
- **ETS for Secure Data Storage:** Utilize ETS for storing sensitive data securely and efficiently.
- **Task and Async Patterns:** Employ tasks for handling concurrent data processing and encryption.

**Code Example: Secure Data Transactions with GenServer**

```elixir
defmodule TransactionProxy do
  use GenServer

  # Client API
  def start_link(_) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{}, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def process_transaction(transaction_data) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:process, transaction_data})
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_call({:process, transaction_data}, _from, state) do
    encrypted_data = encrypt(transaction_data)
    # Process the transaction
    {:reply, :ok, state}
  end

  defp encrypt(data) do
    # Implement encryption logic here
    data
  end
end
```

**Try It Yourself:**

- Implement the `encrypt/1` function using a library like `Comeonin`.
- Add error handling to manage failed transactions.

**Visualizing PCI DSS Compliance in Elixir Applications**

```mermaid

    A[Transaction Request] --> B[TransactionProxy]
    B --> C[Encrypt Data]
    C --> D[Process Transaction]
    D --> E[Log Transaction]
```

**Diagram Description:** This flowchart demonstrates the process of handling transaction requests in a PCI DSS-compliant Elixir application using a GenServer as a proxy.
