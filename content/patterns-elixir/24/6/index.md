## 24.6. Incident Response Planning

In today's digital landscape, where systems are increasingly interconnected and complex, incident response planning is crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of services. This section will guide you through developing a comprehensive incident response plan tailored for Elixir systems, focusing on preparing for incidents, establishing notification procedures, and devising recovery strategies.

### Preparing for Incidents

Incident response planning begins with preparation. This involves understanding potential threats, defining roles and responsibilities, and creating a structured plan to address incidents effectively.

#### Understanding Potential Threats

Identify and categorize potential threats to your Elixir systems. These may include:

- **Security Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **System Outages**: Downtime due to hardware failures, software bugs, or network issues.
- **Data Loss**: Accidental or malicious deletion or corruption of data.
- **Performance Degradation**: Slow response times affecting user experience.

#### Developing Response Plans

A well-defined response plan ensures that your team can act swiftly and efficiently during an incident. Key components include:

- **Incident Identification and Classification**: Establish criteria for identifying incidents and classifying their severity.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Define clear roles for team members, including incident commander, communication lead, and technical responders.
- **Communication Plan**: Develop internal and external communication strategies to keep stakeholders informed.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of incidents, actions taken, and lessons learned.

#### Code Example: Monitoring System Health

```elixir
defmodule HealthMonitor do
  use GenServer

  # Start the GenServer
  def start_link(_) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{}, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  # Initialize state
  def init(state) do
    schedule_health_check()
    {:ok, state}
  end

  # Schedule periodic health checks
  defp schedule_health_check do
    Process.send_after(self(), :check_health, 5_000) # Check every 5 seconds
  end

  # Handle health check messages
  def handle_info(:check_health, state) do
    check_system_health()
    schedule_health_check()
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  # Simulate a health check
  defp check_system_health do
    IO.puts("Checking system health...")
    # Add logic to check system components
  end
end

# Start the HealthMonitor
{:ok, _pid} = HealthMonitor.start_link([])
```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple health monitoring system using Elixir's GenServer. It periodically checks the system's health and can be extended to include specific checks for various components.

### Notification Procedures

Notification procedures are critical for ensuring timely communication during an incident. They help manage stakeholder expectations and comply with legal requirements.

#### Legal Requirements for Breach Notifications

Different jurisdictions have specific legal requirements for breach notifications. Ensure your notification procedures comply with relevant laws, such as:

- **GDPR**: Requires notification within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach.
- **HIPAA**: Mandates notification to affected individuals within 60 days.

#### Establishing Notification Protocols

Develop protocols for notifying internal and external stakeholders:

- **Internal Notifications**: Inform team members and management about the incident and response actions.
- **External Notifications**: Communicate with customers, partners, and regulatory bodies as required.
- **Templates and Scripts**: Prepare templates and scripts for consistent messaging.

#### Diagram: Notification Workflow

```mermaid

    A[Incident Detected] --> B{Severity Assessment}
    B -->|High| C[Notify Incident Commander]
    B -->|Medium| D[Notify Technical Team]
    B -->|Low| E[Log and Monitor]
    C --> F[Internal Communication]
    D --> F
    F --> G[External Notification]
    G --> H[Regulatory Bodies]
    G --> I[Customers]
    G --> J[Partners]
```

This diagram illustrates a notification workflow, showing the decision-making process and communication paths based on incident severity.

### Recovery Strategies

Recovery strategies focus on restoring services and data after an incident, minimizing downtime and data loss.

#### Restoring Services

Develop procedures for quickly restoring services:

- **Backup and Restore**: Implement regular backups and test restore procedures.
- **Failover Systems**: Use redundant systems to ensure continuity during outages.
- **Service Degradation**: Plan for graceful degradation of services to maintain core functionality.

#### Data Recovery

Ensure data integrity and availability through:

- **Data Replication**: Use data replication techniques to maintain copies of critical data.
- **Transaction Logs**: Leverage transaction logs for point-in-time recovery.
- **Data Validation**: Validate data integrity during recovery to prevent corruption.

#### Code Example: Data Backup

```elixir
defmodule DataBackup do
  @backup_dir "/path/to/backup"

  # Perform a backup
  def backup(data) do
    timestamp = :os.system_time(:seconds)
    file_path = "#{@backup_dir}/backup_#{timestamp}.json"

    case File.write(file_path, Jason.encode!(data)) do
      :ok -> IO.puts("Backup successful: #{file_path}")
      {:error, reason} -> IO.puts("Backup failed: #{reason}")
    end
  end
end

# Example usage
data = %{users: [%{id: 1, name: "Alice"}, %{id: 2, name: "Bob"}]}
DataBackup.backup(data)
```

This example demonstrates a simple data backup process, encoding data to JSON and saving it to a file. Modify the backup directory and data structure as needed for your application.

### Visualizing the Incident Response Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    participant IncidentCommander
    participant TechnicalTeam
    participant CommunicationLead

    User->>System: Reports an issue
    System->>IncidentCommander: Detects incident
    IncidentCommander->>TechnicalTeam: Assigns tasks
    TechnicalTeam->>System: Investigates and resolves
    CommunicationLead->>User: Provides updates
    System->>User: Confirms resolution
```

This sequence diagram visualizes the incident response process, highlighting interactions between users, the system, and response team members.
