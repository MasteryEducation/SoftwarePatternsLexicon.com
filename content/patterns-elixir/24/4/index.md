## 24.4. Secure Data Storage and Transmission

In today's digital landscape, securing data is paramount. As expert software engineers and architects, it's crucial to understand and implement secure data storage and transmission practices in Elixir applications. This section delves into encryption at rest, encryption in transit, and key management, providing comprehensive guidance on safeguarding sensitive information.

### Encryption at Rest

Encryption at rest refers to the protection of data stored on disk. This ensures that even if storage media is compromised, the data remains unreadable without the proper decryption keys.

#### Encrypting Databases and Storage Devices

To encrypt data at rest in Elixir, consider the following approaches:

1. **Database-Level Encryption**: Many modern databases offer built-in encryption features. For example, PostgreSQL supports Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), which encrypts data files and backups.

2. **Application-Level Encryption**: Encrypt data before storing it in the database. This approach provides an additional layer of security, as data remains encrypted even if the database's encryption is bypassed.

3. **File System Encryption**: Use file system-level encryption tools like LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) or BitLocker for encrypting entire storage devices.

#### Code Example: Encrypting Data Before Storage

Here's an example of encrypting data in Elixir using the `:crypto` module:

```elixir
defmodule SecureStorage do
  @moduledoc """
  Module for encrypting and decrypting data before storage.
  """

  @key :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(32) # Generate a random 256-bit key
  @iv :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(16)  # Generate a random 128-bit IV

  @doc """
  Encrypts the given plaintext using AES-256-CBC.
  """
  def encrypt(plaintext) do
    :crypto.crypto_one_time(:aes_256_cbc, @key, @iv, plaintext, true)
  end

  @doc """
  Decrypts the given ciphertext using AES-256-CBC.
  """
  def decrypt(ciphertext) do
    :crypto.crypto_one_time(:aes_256_cbc, @key, @iv, ciphertext, false)
  end
end

# Usage
plaintext = "Sensitive data"
ciphertext = SecureStorage.encrypt(plaintext)
decrypted_text = SecureStorage.decrypt(ciphertext)

IO.puts("Original: #{plaintext}")
IO.puts("Encrypted: #{Base.encode64(ciphertext)}")
IO.puts("Decrypted: #{decrypted_text}")
```

### Encryption in Transit

Encryption in transit protects data as it travels across networks. This is crucial for preventing interception and unauthorized access during data transmission.

#### Using HTTPS and Secure Protocols

1. **HTTPS**: Ensure all web traffic is encrypted using HTTPS. This involves obtaining an SSL/TLS certificate and configuring your web server to use it.

2. **Secure Protocols**: Use secure protocols like SSH, SFTP, and FTPS for data transfer. Avoid using insecure protocols like HTTP and FTP.

#### Code Example: Configuring HTTPS in Phoenix

To enable HTTPS in a Phoenix application, update the endpoint configuration in `config/prod.exs`:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
  http: [port: 80],
  https: [
    port: 443,
    cipher_suite: :strong,
    keyfile: System.get_env("SSL_KEY_PATH"),
    certfile: System.get_env("SSL_CERT_PATH")
  ]
```

Ensure that the `SSL_KEY_PATH` and `SSL_CERT_PATH` environment variables point to your SSL certificate and key files.

### Key Management

Proper key management is critical for maintaining the security of encrypted data. Mishandling encryption keys can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.

#### Handling Encryption Keys Securely

1. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate encryption keys to minimize the risk of key compromise. Implement automated key rotation policies.

2. **Secure Storage**: Store encryption keys in a secure location, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a key management service (KMS) like AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS.

3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to encryption keys to only those who need it. Implement strict access controls and audit logs.

#### Code Example: Using AWS KMS for Key Management

Here's an example of using AWS KMS to encrypt and decrypt data in Elixir:

```elixir
defmodule KMSClient do
  @moduledoc """
  Module for interacting with AWS KMS.
  """

  @kms_client ExAws.KMS.Client.new()

  @doc """
  Encrypts data using AWS KMS.
  """
  def encrypt(plaintext, key_id) do
    ExAws.KMS.encrypt(key_id, plaintext)
    |> ExAws.request!()
    |> Map.get("CiphertextBlob")
  end

  @doc """
  Decrypts data using AWS KMS.
  """
  def decrypt(ciphertext_blob) do
    ExAws.KMS.decrypt(ciphertext_blob)
    |> ExAws.request!()
    |> Map.get("Plaintext")
  end
end

# Usage
key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef"
plaintext = "Sensitive data"
ciphertext_blob = KMSClient.encrypt(plaintext, key_id)
decrypted_text = KMSClient.decrypt(ciphertext_blob)

IO.puts("Original: #{plaintext}")
IO.puts("Encrypted: #{Base.encode64(ciphertext_blob)}")
IO.puts("Decrypted: #{decrypted_text}")
```

### Visualizing Secure Data Transmission

To better understand secure data transmission, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    Client->>Server: HTTPS Request
    Server-->>Client: HTTPS Response
    Note right of Client: Data is encrypted in transit
    Note left of Server: SSL/TLS ensures secure communication
```

This diagram illustrates the secure communication between a client and server using HTTPS, ensuring data is encrypted during transmission.

### Key Takeaways

- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt data stored on disk using database-level, application-level, or file system encryption.
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use HTTPS and secure protocols to protect data during transmission.
- **Key Management**: Implement key rotation, secure storage, and access control to safeguard encryption keys.

### Try It Yourself
