## 32.7. Sample Projects and Code Examples

Welcome to the comprehensive section on sample projects and code examples in Elixir. This section is designed to provide you with practical insights into applying design patterns in Elixir through real-world projects, code repositories, practice exercises, and templates. Whether you're building web applications, APIs, or command-line tools, these resources will guide you in mastering Elixir's functional programming paradigm.

### Tutorial Projects

Let's dive into some step-by-step guides to building applications with Elixir. These projects will help you understand how to apply design patterns effectively in real-world scenarios.

#### 1. Building a Real-Time Chat Application

**Objective:** Create a real-time chat application using the Phoenix framework and Elixir's concurrency features.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Concurrency:** Utilize Elixir's lightweight processes to handle multiple chat sessions.
- **Phoenix Channels:** Implement real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **OTP Supervision Trees:** Ensure fault-tolerance and reliability.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Set Up Phoenix Project:**
   ```bash
   mix phx.new chat_app --no-ecto
   cd chat_app
   ```

2. **Create a Chat Room Channel:**
   ```elixir
   defmodule ChatAppWeb.RoomChannel do
     use ChatAppWeb, :channel

     def join("room:lobby", _message, socket) do
       {:ok, socket}
     end

     def handle_in("new_msg", %{"body" => body}, socket) do
       broadcast!(socket, "new_msg", %{body: body})
       {:noreply, socket}
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Configure the Endpoint:**
   ```elixir
   socket "/socket", ChatAppWeb.UserSocket,
     websocket: true,
     longpoll: false
   ```

4. **Create a Simple Frontend:**
   Use JavaScript to connect to the channel and handle incoming messages.

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```

**Try It Yourself:** Modify the application to support multiple chat rooms and add user authentication.

#### 2. Developing a RESTful API with Elixir

**Objective:** Build a RESTful API using Elixir and the Phoenix framework.

**Key Concepts:**
- **RESTful Design:** Implement CRUD operations.
- **Ecto:** Use Ecto for database interactions.
- **JSON Serialization:** Convert Elixir data structures to JSON.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Initialize Phoenix Project with Ecto:**
   ```bash
   mix phx.new api_app --no-html
   cd api_app
   ```

2. **Define a Resource Schema:**
   ```elixir
   defmodule ApiApp.Blog.Post do
     use Ecto.Schema
     import Ecto.Changeset

     schema "posts" do
       field :title, :string
       field :content, :string
       timestamps()
     end

     def changeset(post, attrs) do
       post
       |> cast(attrs, [:title, :content])
       |> validate_required([:title, :content])
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Create a Controller:**
   ```elixir
   defmodule ApiAppWeb.PostController do
     use ApiAppWeb, :controller

     alias ApiApp.Blog
     alias ApiApp.Blog.Post

     def index(conn, _params) do
       posts = Blog.list_posts()
       render(conn, "index.json", posts: posts)
     end

     def create(conn, %{"post" => post_params}) do
       with {:ok, %Post{} = post} <- Blog.create_post(post_params) do
         conn
         |> put_status(:created)
         |> render("show.json", post: post)
       end
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Set Up Routes:**
   ```elixir
   scope "/api", ApiAppWeb do
     pipe_through :api
     resources "/posts", PostController, except: [:new, :edit]
   end
   ```

5. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```

**Try It Yourself:** Extend the API to include user authentication and authorization.

### Practice Exercises

Hone your Elixir programming skills with these challenges and exercises.

#### Exercise 1: Implement a GenServer

**Objective:** Create a GenServer that manages a simple counter.

**Instructions:**
1. **Define the GenServer Module:**
   ```elixir
   defmodule Counter do
     use GenServer

     # Client API
     def start_link(initial_value) do
       GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_value, name: __MODULE__)
     end

     def increment do
       GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :increment)
     end

     def get_value do
       GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :get_value)
     end

     # Server Callbacks
     def init(initial_value) do
       {:ok, initial_value}
     end

     def handle_call(:increment, _from, state) do
       {:reply, state + 1, state + 1}
     end

     def handle_call(:get_value, _from, state) do
       {:reply, state, state}
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Test the GenServer:**
   ```elixir
   Counter.start_link(0)
   Counter.increment()
   Counter.get_value() # Should return 1
   ```

**Try It Yourself:** Modify the GenServer to support decrementing the counter.

#### Exercise 2: Create a Simple Web Scraper

**Objective:** Build a web scraper using Elixir's HTTP client and Floki for HTML parsing.

**Instructions:**
1. **Set Up HTTPoison and Floki:**
   Add dependencies to `mix.exs`:
   ```elixir
   defp deps do
     [
       {:httpoison, "~> 1.8"},
       {:floki, "~> 0.30"}
     ]
   end
   ```

2. **Implement the Scraper:**
   ```elixir
   defmodule WebScraper do
     def fetch_titles(url) do
       {:ok, response} = HTTPoison.get(url)
       {:ok, document} = Floki.parse_document(response.body)
       Floki.find(document, "h1")
       |> Enum.map(&Floki.text/1)
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Test the Scraper:**
   ```elixir
   WebScraper.fetch_titles("https://example.com")
   ```

**Try It Yourself:** Extend the scraper to extract links and other HTML elements.

To enhance understanding, let's visualize some of the design patterns using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Visualizing the GenServer Pattern

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant GenServer
    Client->>GenServer: start_link(initial_value)
    Client->>GenServer: increment()
    GenServer-->>Client: reply(new_value)
    Client->>GenServer: get_value()
    GenServer-->>Client: reply(current_value)
```

**Description:** This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between a client and a GenServer, highlighting the process of starting the server, incrementing a counter, and retrieving its value.
