## 22.3. Reducing Memory Usage

In the world of high-performance applications, efficient memory usage is crucial. Elixir, running on the BEAM (Bogdan/Björn's Erlang Abstract Machine), offers unique memory management capabilities. In this section, we will explore how to optimize memory usage in Elixir applications by understanding BEAM's memory model, employing effective strategies, and leveraging garbage collection.

### Memory Management on the BEAM

The BEAM virtual machine is designed to handle concurrent processes efficiently. Each process in BEAM has its own heap, stack, and process dictionary, which means memory is isolated between processes. This isolation is a double-edged sword: it provides safety and fault tolerance but can lead to increased memory usage if not managed properly.

#### How Processes Consume and Release Memory

1. **Process Isolation**: Each process has its own memory space, which prevents memory corruption across processes but can lead to higher overall memory usage.
2. **Heap Management**: Processes allocate memory on their own heap. When a process terminates, its memory is reclaimed.
3. **Message Passing**: Data is copied between process heaps during message passing, which can increase memory usage if large data structures are frequently passed.

### Strategies for Reducing Memory Usage

#### Minimizing Large Data Structures in Process State

1. **Avoid Storing Large Data in Process State**: Keep process state minimal. Use external storage like ETS (Erlang Term Storage) for large data.
   
   ```elixir
   defmodule MyProcess do
     use GenServer

     def init(_) do
       # Initialize with minimal state
       {:ok, %{}}
     end

     def handle_call(:get_large_data, _from, state) do
       # Fetch large data from ETS instead of storing in state
       large_data = :ets.lookup(:my_table, :large_data)
       {:reply, large_data, state}
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Use References for Large Data**: Instead of copying large data structures, use references or identifiers to access them.

#### Using Binaries Wisely to Prevent Memory Leaks

1. **Binary Handling**: Large binaries (>64 bytes) are stored outside the process heap and are reference-counted. This can lead to memory leaks if binaries are not handled properly.

   - **Avoid Long-Lived Binaries**: Ensure binaries are not held in process state for long durations.
   - **Use `:binary.copy/1`**: To ensure a binary is not shared across processes, use `:binary.copy/1` to create a new binary.

   ```elixir
   def handle_call(:process_binary, _from, state) do
     # Copy binary to avoid sharing
     binary = :binary.copy(state[:large_binary])
     {:reply, process(binary), state}
   end
   ```

2. **Binary Matching**: Use binary pattern matching to process binaries efficiently without copying them.

   ```elixir
   def parse_binary(<<header::binary-size(4), body::binary>>) do
     # Process header and body separately
     {header, body}
   end
   ```

### Garbage Collection

Garbage collection in BEAM is process-level, meaning each process collects its own garbage independently. This approach minimizes pause times but requires understanding to optimize memory usage.

#### Understanding Process-Level Garbage Collection

1. **Generational Garbage Collection**: BEAM uses a generational garbage collector, which is efficient for short-lived processes but can lead to memory bloat in long-lived processes.
2. **Triggering Garbage Collection**: Garbage collection is triggered when a process heap grows beyond a certain threshold. You can manually trigger garbage collection using `:erlang.garbage_collect/1`.

   ```elixir
   def handle_info(:trigger_gc, state) do
     # Manually trigger garbage collection
     :erlang.garbage_collect(self())
     {:noreply, state}
   end
   ```

3. **Monitoring Memory Usage**: Use tools like `:observer.start()` and `:recon` to monitor memory usage and garbage collection activity.

### Examples of Refactoring Code for Memory Efficiency

1. **Refactor Recursive Functions**: Use tail recursion to optimize memory usage in recursive functions.

   ```elixir
   defmodule Factorial do
     def calculate(n), do: calculate(n, 1)

     defp calculate(0, acc), do: acc
     defp calculate(n, acc), do: calculate(n - 1, n * acc)
   end
   ```

2. **Optimize Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures like tuples and maps to minimize memory footprint.

   ```elixir
   defmodule DataOptimizer do
     def optimize_data(data) do
       # Convert list to tuple for memory efficiency
       Enum.map(data, &Tuple.to_list/1)
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Leverage Streams for Lazy Evaluation**: Use streams to process large data sets lazily, reducing memory usage.

   ```elixir
   defmodule StreamProcessor do
     def process_large_data(data) do
       data
       |> Stream.map(&process_item/1)
       |> Enum.to_list()
     end
   end
   ```

### Visualizing Memory Management

To better understand memory management in BEAM, let's visualize the process memory model and garbage collection.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Process Start] --> B[Heap Allocation];
    B --> C[Message Passing];
    C --> D[Garbage Collection];
    D --> E[Process Termination];
    E --> F[Memory Reclamation];
```
