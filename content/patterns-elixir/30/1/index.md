## 30.1. Building a Real-Time Chat Application

In this section, we will delve into the process of building a real-time chat application using Elixir and the Phoenix framework. This case study will guide you through the essential components and design patterns necessary to create a scalable, fault-tolerant chat system capable of handling high concurrency and ensuring reliable message delivery.

### Requirements

Before we dive into the implementation, let's outline the key requirements for our chat application:

- **Instant Messaging**: Users should be able to send and receive messages instantly.
- **User Presence**: Display the online status of users in real-time.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle a large number of concurrent users efficiently.

### Technologies Used

To meet these requirements, we will leverage the following technologies:

- **Phoenix Channels**: For real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **Phoenix Presence**: To track user presence and broadcast state changes.
- **WebSockets**: For persistent connections that enable real-time data exchange.

### Implementation Highlights

#### Establishing Bidirectional Communication

The backbone of our chat application is the ability to establish bidirectional communication between the client and server. Phoenix Channels provide an abstraction over WebSockets, making it easier to manage real-time connections.

```elixir
defmodule ChatWeb.UserSocket do
  use Phoenix.Socket

  ## Channels
  channel "room:*", ChatWeb.RoomChannel

  # Transport
  transport :websocket, Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket

  def connect(%{"token" => token}, socket) do
    # Authenticate user and assign user_id to socket
    case authenticate_user(token) do
      {:ok, user_id} -> {:ok, assign(socket, :user_id, user_id)}
      :error -> :error
    end
  end

  def id(socket), do: "users_socket:#{socket.assigns.user_id}"
end
```

In this example, we define a `UserSocket` module that handles WebSocket connections. The `connect/2` function authenticates the user and assigns a `user_id` to the socket, which is crucial for tracking user presence and managing connections.

#### Handling User State and Message Broadcasting

Once the connection is established, we need to handle user state and broadcast messages to all participants in a chat room. This is achieved using Phoenix Channels and Presence.

```elixir
defmodule ChatWeb.RoomChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel

  alias ChatWeb.Presence

  def join("room:" <> room_id, _params, socket) do
    send(self(), :after_join)
    {:ok, assign(socket, :room_id, room_id)}
  end

  def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
    Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
      online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:seconds))
    })
    push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket))
    {:noreply, socket}
  end

  def handle_in("new_msg", %{"body" => body}, socket) do
    broadcast!(socket, "new_msg", %{user: socket.assigns.user_id, body: body})
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

In the `RoomChannel` module, we handle user joining and message broadcasting. The `join/3` function assigns the room ID to the socket, and `handle_info/2` tracks user presence using the `Presence` module. The `handle_in/3` function broadcasts new messages to all users in the room.

#### Challenges

Building a real-time chat application comes with its own set of challenges:

- **Managing High User Concurrency**: As the number of users increases, the system must efficiently manage connections and message delivery.
- **Ensuring Message Delivery and Ordering**: Messages should be delivered reliably and in the correct order, even under high load.

### Visualizing the Architecture

To better understand the architecture of our chat application, let's visualize the components and their interactions using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client] -->|WebSocket| B[Phoenix Server];
    B -->|Channel| C[RoomChannel];
    C -->|Broadcast| D[All Clients];
    C -->|Track| E[Presence];
    E -->|Update| D;
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the flow of data in our chat application. Clients connect to the Phoenix server via WebSockets, which are managed by the `UserSocket` module. The `RoomChannel` handles message broadcasting and user presence tracking, ensuring that all clients receive updates in real-time.

### Code Examples and Exercises

Now that we've covered the core concepts, let's explore some code examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

#### Code Example: Implementing a Simple Chat Room

Here's a complete example of a simple chat room using Phoenix Channels and Presence:

```elixir
defmodule ChatWeb.UserSocket do
  use Phoenix.Socket

  channel "room:*", ChatWeb.RoomChannel
  transport :websocket, Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket

  def connect(%{"token" => token}, socket) do
    case authenticate_user(token) do
      {:ok, user_id} -> {:ok, assign(socket, :user_id, user_id)}
      :error -> :error
    end
  end

  def id(socket), do: "users_socket:#{socket.assigns.user_id}"
end

defmodule ChatWeb.RoomChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel

  alias ChatWeb.Presence

  def join("room:" <> room_id, _params, socket) do
    send(self(), :after_join)
    {:ok, assign(socket, :room_id, room_id)}
  end

  def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
    Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
      online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:seconds))
    })
    push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket))
    {:noreply, socket}
  end

  def handle_in("new_msg", %{"body" => body}, socket) do
    broadcast!(socket, "new_msg", %{user: socket.assigns.user_id, body: body})
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

**Try It Yourself**: Modify the code to add a feature that allows users to send private messages to each other. Consider how you might handle user authentication and message routing.
