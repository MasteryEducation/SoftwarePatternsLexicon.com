## 16.5. Data Transformation and Enrichment

In the realm of data engineering, data transformation and enrichment are crucial processes that enable the conversion of raw data into meaningful insights. Elixir, with its robust functional programming paradigm and powerful concurrency model, offers a unique set of tools and techniques to perform these tasks efficiently. In this section, we will explore advanced techniques for parsing, cleaning, transforming, and enriching data using Elixir.

### Parsing and Cleaning Data

Data parsing and cleaning are foundational steps in any data processing pipeline. In Elixir, pattern matching and regular expressions are powerful tools that can be leveraged to parse and clean data effectively.

#### Using Pattern Matching and Regular Expressions

Pattern matching is a core feature of Elixir that allows developers to destructure data and extract relevant information with ease. Regular expressions, on the other hand, provide a flexible way to search and manipulate strings based on patterns.

**Example: Parsing a CSV Line**

Let's consider a simple example where we parse a CSV line using pattern matching and regular expressions:

```elixir
defmodule CSVParser do
  def parse_line(line) do
    # Split the line by commas
    line
    |> String.split(",")
    |> Enum.map(&String.trim/1)
  end
end

# Usage
csv_line = "John Doe, 30, johndoe@example.com"
parsed_data = CSVParser.parse_line(csv_line)
IO.inspect(parsed_data) # Output: ["John Doe", "30", "johndoe@example.com"]
```

In this example, we use `String.split/2` to break the CSV line into individual fields and `Enum.map/2` with `String.trim/1` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

**Handling Incomplete or Malformed Data Gracefully**

When dealing with real-world data, it's common to encounter incomplete or malformed entries. Elixir's pattern matching can be used to handle such cases gracefully.

**Example: Handling Missing Fields**

```elixir
defmodule SafeCSVParser do
  def parse_line(line) do
    case String.split(line, ",") do
      [name, age, email] -> {:ok, %{name: name, age: age, email: email}}
      _ -> {:error, "Malformed CSV line"}
    end
  end
end

# Usage
csv_line = "Jane Doe, 25"
result = SafeCSVParser.parse_line(csv_line)
IO.inspect(result) # Output: {:error, "Malformed CSV line"}
```

Here, we use a `case` statement to match against the expected number of fields. If the pattern doesn't match, we return an error tuple.

### Transforming Data Formats

Data transformation often involves converting data from one format to another. Elixir provides libraries and functions to facilitate these conversions, including JSON, CSV, XML, and custom formats.

#### Converting Between JSON, CSV, XML, and Custom Formats

**JSON Conversion**

Elixir's `Jason` library is a popular choice for JSON encoding and decoding.

**Example: JSON Encoding and Decoding**

```elixir
defmodule JSONConverter do
  def encode_to_json(data) do
    Jason.encode!(data)
  end

  def decode_from_json(json_string) do
    Jason.decode!(json_string)
  end
end

# Usage
data = %{name: "Alice", age: 28}
json_string = JSONConverter.encode_to_json(data)
IO.puts(json_string) # Output: {"name":"Alice","age":28}

decoded_data = JSONConverter.decode_from_json(json_string)
IO.inspect(decoded_data) # Output: %{"name" => "Alice", "age" => 28}
```

**CSV Conversion**

For CSV conversion, the `NimbleCSV` library is a powerful tool.

**Example: CSV Encoding and Decoding**

```elixir
defmodule CSVConverter do
  alias NimbleCSV.RFC4180, as: CSV

  def encode_to_csv(data) do
    data
    |> CSV.dump_to_iodata()
    |> IO.iodata_to_binary()
  end

  def decode_from_csv(csv_string) do
    csv_string
    |> CSV.parse_string()
  end
end

# Usage
data = [["Alice", "28"], ["Bob", "34"]]
csv_string = CSVConverter.encode_to_csv(data)
IO.puts(csv_string) # Output: "Alice,28\nBob,34\n"

decoded_data = CSVConverter.decode_from_csv(csv_string)
IO.inspect(decoded_data) # Output: [["Alice", "28"], ["Bob", "34"]]
```

**XML Conversion**

For XML, the `SweetXml` library provides a convenient way to parse and transform XML data.

**Example: XML Parsing**

```elixir
defmodule XMLParser do
  import SweetXml

  def parse(xml_string) do
    xml_string
    |> xpath(~x"//person"l, name: ~x"./name/text()"s, age: ~x"./age/text()"i)
  end
end

# Usage
xml_string = """
<people>
  <person>
    <name>Charlie</name>
    <age>40</age>
  </person>
</people>
"""

parsed_data = XMLParser.parse(xml_string)
IO.inspect(parsed_data) # Output: [%{name: "Charlie", age: 40}]
```

### Data Enrichment

Data enrichment involves augmenting existing data with additional information to enhance its value. This can be achieved by integrating third-party APIs or combining datasets.

#### Augmenting Data with Additional Information

**Example: Enriching User Data with Geolocation**

Let's enrich user data by adding geolocation information using a third-party API.

```elixir
defmodule GeolocationEnrichment do
  @api_url "https://api.ipgeolocation.io/ipgeo"

  def enrich_user_data(user_data, api_key) do
    case HTTPoison.get("#{@api_url}?apiKey=#{api_key}&ip=#{user_data.ip}") do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body}} ->
        {:ok, geo_info} = Jason.decode(body)
        Map.merge(user_data, geo_info)

      {:error, _reason} ->
        {:error, "Failed to fetch geolocation data"}
    end
  end
end

# Usage
user_data = %{name: "David", ip: "8.8.8.8"}
api_key = "your_api_key_here"
enriched_data = GeolocationEnrichment.enrich_user_data(user_data, api_key)
IO.inspect(enriched_data)
```

In this example, we use the `HTTPoison` library to make an HTTP request to a geolocation API and merge the response with the existing user data.

#### Integrating Third-Party APIs for Enhanced Datasets

Integrating third-party APIs can significantly enhance the datasets by providing additional context or insights.

**Example: Fetching Weather Data**

```elixir
defmodule WeatherEnrichment do
  @api_url "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

  def fetch_weather(city, api_key) do
    case HTTPoison.get("#{@api_url}?q=#{city}&appid=#{api_key}") do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body}} ->
        {:ok, weather_info} = Jason.decode(body)
        weather_info

      {:error, _reason} ->
        {:error, "Failed to fetch weather data"}
    end
  end
end

# Usage
city = "London"
api_key = "your_api_key_here"
weather_data = WeatherEnrichment.fetch_weather(city, api_key)
IO.inspect(weather_data)
```

### Visualizing Data Transformation and Enrichment
