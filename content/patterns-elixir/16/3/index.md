## 16.3. Integrating with Data Stores (SQL, NoSQL, Time-Series Databases)

In the realm of data engineering, integrating with various types of databases is a crucial skill for building robust applications. Elixir, with its functional programming paradigm and powerful concurrency model, offers unique advantages for managing data interactions. In this section, we'll explore how to integrate Elixir with SQL, NoSQL, and Time-Series databases, leveraging Elixir's capabilities to create scalable and efficient data-driven applications.

### SQL Databases with Ecto

Ecto is Elixir's primary database wrapper and query generator, providing a comprehensive suite for interacting with SQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. It offers a rich set of features for defining schemas, writing queries, and managing database migrations.

#### Connecting to SQL Databases

To connect to an SQL database using Ecto, you need to define a repository module that serves as the interface to your database. Here's a basic setup for connecting to a PostgreSQL database:

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.6"},
    {:postgrex, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  database: "my_app_db",
  hostname: "localhost",
  show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true,
  pool_size: 10
```

```elixir
# lib/my_app/repo.ex
defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres
end
```

#### Writing Queries and Managing Migrations

Ecto provides a DSL for writing queries that are both expressive and type-safe. Here's an example of a simple query to fetch users from a `users` table:

```elixir
import Ecto.Query

def get_users do
  MyApp.Repo.all(from u in "users", select: u)
end
```

For managing database migrations, Ecto offers a set of mix tasks to create, run, and rollback migrations. Here's how you can create a migration to add a new table:

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration create_users
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:users) do
      add :name, :string
      add :email, :string

      timestamps()
    end
  end
end
```

### NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas and are often used for applications requiring high scalability and performance. Elixir can integrate with popular NoSQL databases like MongoDB and CouchDB using appropriate clients.

#### Integrating with MongoDB

To connect to MongoDB, you can use the `mongodb` driver for Elixir. Here's a basic example of how to set up and interact with a MongoDB database:

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    {:mongodb, "~> 0.5.1"}
  ]
end
```

```elixir
# lib/my_app/mongo.ex
defmodule MyApp.Mongo do
  use Mongo

  def start_link do
    Mongo.start_link(url: "mongodb://localhost:27017/my_db")
  end

  def insert_document(collection, document) do
    {:ok, conn} = start_link()
    Mongo.insert_one(conn, collection, document)
  end
end
```

#### Integrating with CouchDB

CouchDB is another popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented model. You can use the `couchdb` client to interact with CouchDB:

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    {:couchdb, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

```elixir
# lib/my_app/couch.ex
defmodule MyApp.Couch do
  use CouchDB

  def create_document(db, doc) do
    {:ok, conn} = CouchDB.start_link(url: "http://localhost:5984")
    CouchDB.put(conn, db, doc)
  end
end
```

### Time-Series Databases

Time-Series databases are optimized for handling time-stamped data, making them ideal for applications like monitoring, IoT, and analytics. Elixir can integrate with Time-Series databases like InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.

#### Working with InfluxDB

InfluxDB is a popular choice for time-series data. You can use the `instream` library to interact with InfluxDB:

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    {:instream, "~> 0.23"}
  ]
end
```

```elixir
# lib/my_app/influx.ex
defmodule MyApp.Influx do
  use Instream.Connection, otp_app: :my_app

  def write_data(measurement, fields, tags \\ %{}) do
    point = %{
      measurement: measurement,
      fields: fields,
      tags: tags,
      timestamp: :os.system_time(:second)
    }

    MyApp.Influx.write(point)
  end
end
```

#### Working with TimescaleDB

TimescaleDB is an extension of PostgreSQL that provides time-series capabilities. You can use Ecto to interact with TimescaleDB as you would with any PostgreSQL database, taking advantage of TimescaleDB's time-series features.

### Choosing the Right Database

Selecting the appropriate database for your application depends on several factors, including data models, scalability, and performance needs. Here's a brief guide to help you make an informed decision:

- **SQL Databases**: Ideal for structured data with complex relationships. Use when you need ACID compliance and strong consistency.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data. Opt for NoSQL when you need high scalability and flexible schemas.
- **Time-Series Databases**: Best for applications that require efficient handling of time-stamped data. Choose these for monitoring, analytics, and IoT applications.

### Visualizing Database Integration

To better understand how Elixir interacts with different types of databases, let's visualize the architecture using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Elixir Application] -->|Ecto| B[SQL Database];
    A -->|MongoDB Client| C[MongoDB];
    A -->|CouchDB Client| D[CouchDB];
    A -->|Instream| E[InfluxDB];
    A -->|Ecto| F[TimescaleDB];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates how an Elixir application can connect to various databases using different libraries and clients. Ecto is used for SQL and TimescaleDB, while specific clients are used for MongoDB, CouchDB, and InfluxDB.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by modifying them to suit your specific use case. For instance, try changing the database configurations, adding new fields to your schemas, or writing more complex queries. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of database integration in Elixir.
