## 6.6. Composite Pattern with Nested Data Structures

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In Elixir, a functional programming language, we can leverage nested data structures such as maps, lists, and structs to implement this pattern effectively.

### Hierarchical Tree Structures

Hierarchical tree structures are essential in representing data that has a parent-child relationship. The Composite Pattern is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to work with complex tree structures, such as:

- **User Interfaces (UI):** Building UI components where each component can contain other components.
- **File Systems:** Representing directories and files where directories can contain other directories or files.
- **Organizational Charts:** Modeling organizational hierarchies where each node can represent a department or an employee.

### Implementing the Composite Pattern

In Elixir, we can implement the Composite Pattern using nested maps, lists, or structs. Let's explore each approach in detail.

#### Using Nested Maps

Maps in Elixir are versatile data structures that can be used to represent hierarchical data. Here's how you can use maps to implement the Composite Pattern:

```elixir
defmodule FileSystem do
  defstruct name: "", children: []

  def new(name), do: %FileSystem{name: name, children: []}

  def add_child(parent, child) do
    %FileSystem{parent | children: parent.children ++ [child]}
  end

  def print_structure(%FileSystem{name: name, children: children}, level \\ 0) do
    IO.puts(String.duplicate("  ", level) <> name)
    Enum.each(children, &print_structure(&1, level + 1))
  end
end

# Example usage
root = FileSystem.new("root")
documents = FileSystem.new("documents")
pictures = FileSystem.new("pictures")
file1 = FileSystem.new("file1.txt")
file2 = FileSystem.new("file2.txt")

root = root
|> FileSystem.add_child(documents)
|> FileSystem.add_child(pictures)

documents = documents
|> FileSystem.add_child(file1)
|> FileSystem.add_child(file2)

FileSystem.print_structure(root)
```

In this example, we define a `FileSystem` struct with a `name` and `children`. The `add_child/2` function allows us to add a child node to a parent node, and `print_structure/2` recursively prints the structure.

#### Using Nested Lists

Lists can also be used to represent hierarchical data, especially when the order of elements is important. Here's an example:

```elixir
defmodule OrgChart do
  defstruct name: "", subordinates: []

  def new(name), do: %OrgChart{name: name, subordinates: []}

  def add_subordinate(manager, subordinate) do
    %OrgChart{manager | subordinates: manager.subordinates ++ [subordinate]}
  end

  def print_chart(%OrgChart{name: name, subordinates: subordinates}, level \\ 0) do
    IO.puts(String.duplicate("  ", level) <> name)
    Enum.each(subordinates, &print_chart(&1, level + 1))
  end
end

# Example usage
ceo = OrgChart.new("CEO")
cto = OrgChart.new("CTO")
dev1 = OrgChart.new("Developer 1")
dev2 = OrgChart.new("Developer 2")

ceo = ceo
|> OrgChart.add_subordinate(cto)

cto = cto
|> OrgChart.add_subordinate(dev1)
|> OrgChart.add_subordinate(dev2)

OrgChart.print_chart(ceo)
```

Here, we define an `OrgChart` struct with a `name` and `subordinates`. The `add_subordinate/2` function adds a subordinate to a manager, and `print_chart/2` recursively prints the organizational chart.

#### Using Nested Structs

Structs provide a way to define custom data types in Elixir, making them suitable for implementing the Composite Pattern. Here's an example using structs:

```elixir
defmodule UIComponent do
  defstruct name: "", components: []

  def new(name), do: %UIComponent{name: name, components: []}

  def add_component(parent, component) do
    %UIComponent{parent | components: parent.components ++ [component]}
  end

  def render(%UIComponent{name: name, components: components}, level \\ 0) do
    IO.puts(String.duplicate("  ", level) <> name)
    Enum.each(components, &render(&1, level + 1))
  end
end

# Example usage
window = UIComponent.new("Window")
button = UIComponent.new("Button")
text_field = UIComponent.new("TextField")

window = window
|> UIComponent.add_component(button)
|> UIComponent.add_component(text_field)

UIComponent.render(window)
```

In this example, we define a `UIComponent` struct with a `name` and `components`. The `add_component/2` function adds a component to a parent component, and `render/2` recursively renders the UI structure.

### Use Cases

The Composite Pattern is versatile and can be applied to various use cases. Let's explore some common scenarios where this pattern is beneficial.

#### Building UI Components

In UI development, components often have a hierarchical structure. For example, a window can contain buttons, text fields, and other components. The Composite Pattern allows you to build complex UI structures by composing simple components.

#### File Systems

File systems are inherently hierarchical, with directories containing files and other directories. The Composite Pattern provides a natural way to represent and manipulate file systems, allowing you to perform operations on individual files or entire directories.

#### Organizational Charts

Organizational charts represent the hierarchy of an organization, with departments and employees forming a tree structure. The Composite Pattern enables you to model and manage organizational hierarchies effectively.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Composite Pattern in Elixir, consider the following:

- **Immutability:** Elixir's immutable data structures ensure that modifications to a composite structure result in a new structure, preserving the original.
- **Recursion:** Recursive functions are essential for traversing and manipulating hierarchical data. Ensure that your recursive functions are tail-recursive to optimize performance.
- **Pattern Matching:** Leverage pattern matching to simplify operations on composite structures, such as extracting specific nodes or performing transformations.

### Elixir Unique Features

Elixir offers several unique features that enhance the implementation of the Composite Pattern:

- **Pattern Matching:** Elixir's powerful pattern matching capabilities make it easy to work with nested data structures, allowing you to deconstruct and manipulate them efficiently.
- **Immutability:** Elixir's immutable data structures ensure that modifications to a composite structure do not affect the original, enabling safe concurrent operations.
- **Concurrency:** Elixir's lightweight processes and message-passing model allow you to build concurrent applications that can process composite structures in parallel.

### Differences and Similarities

The Composite Pattern is often compared to other structural patterns, such as the Decorator and Proxy patterns. While these patterns share some similarities, they serve different purposes:

- **Decorator Pattern:** The Decorator Pattern adds behavior to individual objects without affecting other objects. In contrast, the Composite Pattern focuses on treating individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Proxy Pattern:** The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object, controlling access to it. The Composite Pattern, on the other hand, is concerned with composing objects into tree structures.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Composite Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- **Add More Levels:** Extend the hierarchy by adding more levels of nodes to the tree structure.
- **Implement New Operations:** Add new operations to the composite structure, such as searching for a specific node or calculating the depth of the tree.
- **Use Different Data Structures:** Experiment with different data structures, such as tuples or keyword lists, to represent the composite structure.

### Visualizing the Composite Pattern

To better understand the Composite Pattern, let's visualize a simple file system structure using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    root[Root Directory]
    documents[Documents]
    pictures[Pictures]
    file1[File1.txt]
    file2[File2.txt]

    root --> documents
    root --> pictures
    documents --> file1
    documents --> file2
```

In this diagram, we have a root directory containing two subdirectories, "Documents" and "Pictures." The "Documents" directory contains two files, "File1.txt" and "File2.txt."
