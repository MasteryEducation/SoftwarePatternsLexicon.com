## 8.8. Error Handling Patterns with `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}`

Error handling is a critical aspect of software development, and in Elixir, it is elegantly managed through the use of tagged tuples, specifically `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}`. This pattern not only provides a consistent way to represent success and failure but also leverages Elixir's powerful pattern matching capabilities to simplify error handling and improve code readability. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of these patterns, explore their benefits, and provide practical examples to illustrate their use.

### Consistent Error Representation

In Elixir, functions often return results in the form of tagged tuples. This convention provides a uniform way to handle both successful and unsuccessful outcomes. The two primary forms are:

- **`{:ok, result}`**: Indicates a successful operation, with `result` containing the successful value.
- **`{:error, reason}`**: Indicates a failure, with `reason` providing information about the error.

#### Why Use Tagged Tuples?

Using tagged tuples for function results offers several advantages:

1. **Consistency**: By adhering to a standard format, developers can easily predict and handle function outcomes.
2. **Clarity**: The tags (`:ok` and `:error`) immediately convey the nature of the result, making the code more readable.
3. **Pattern Matching**: Elixir's pattern matching allows for concise and expressive handling of these tuples, reducing boilerplate code.

### Pattern Matching on Results

Pattern matching is a cornerstone of Elixir's functional programming paradigm. It allows developers to destructure data and execute code based on specific patterns. When combined with tagged tuples, pattern matching becomes a powerful tool for error handling.

#### Simplifying Result Handling

Consider a function that performs a division operation. It returns `{:ok, result}` if successful and `{:error, reason}` if an error occurs (e.g., division by zero).

```elixir
defmodule Math do
  def divide(a, b) when b != 0 do
    {:ok, a / b}
  end

  def divide(_, 0) do
    {:error, :division_by_zero}
  end
end
```

To handle the result of this function, we can use pattern matching:

```elixir
case Math.divide(10, 2) do
  {:ok, result} ->
    IO.puts("Division successful: #{result}")

  {:error, :division_by_zero} ->
    IO.puts("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")
end
```

This approach allows us to clearly define the logic for handling both success and failure cases, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

### Benefits of Using Tagged Tuples

The use of `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}` patterns in Elixir provides several benefits:

1. **Clear Error Propagation**: Errors can be propagated through the call stack without losing context, allowing for more informative error handling.
2. **Easier Debugging**: By providing a consistent error format, debugging becomes more straightforward, as developers can quickly identify and address issues.
3. **Improved Code Readability**: The use of tagged tuples and pattern matching results in cleaner, more expressive code that is easier to read and maintain.

### Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to solidify our understanding of these patterns.

#### Example 1: File Operations

Consider a module that reads a file and returns its contents. If the file does not exist, it returns an error.

```elixir
defmodule FileReader do
  def read_file(path) do
    case File.read(path) do
      {:ok, content} ->
        {:ok, content}

      {:error, reason} ->
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
end
```

Handling the result of this function is straightforward:

```elixir
case FileReader.read_file("example.txt") do
  {:ok, content} ->
    IO.puts("File content: #{content}")

  {:error, reason} ->
    IO.puts("Failed to read file: #{reason}")
end
```

#### Example 2: HTTP Requests

Consider a module that makes an HTTP request and returns the response. If the request fails, it returns an error.

```elixir
defmodule HTTPClient do
  def get(url) do
    case HTTPoison.get(url) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: body}} ->
        {:ok, body}

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code}} ->
        {:error, {:unexpected_status, status_code}}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} ->
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
end
```

Handling the result of this function:

```elixir
case HTTPClient.get("https://example.com") do
  {:ok, body} ->
    IO.puts("Response body: #{body}")

  {:error, {:unexpected_status, status_code}} ->
    IO.puts("Unexpected status code: #{status_code}")

  {:error, reason} ->
    IO.puts("Request failed: #{reason}")
end
```

### Visualizing Error Handling with Tagged Tuples

To better understand how tagged tuples and pattern matching work together, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Call Function]
    B --> C{Result}
    C -->|{:ok, result}| D[Handle Success]
    C -->|{:error, reason}| E[Handle Error]
    D --> F[End]
    E --> F[End]
```

**Figure 1: Flowchart of Error Handling with Tagged Tuples**

This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process when handling function results using tagged tuples. The function is called, and based on the result (`{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`), the appropriate handling logic is executed.

### Design Considerations

When implementing error handling patterns with tagged tuples, consider the following:

- **Consistency**: Ensure that all functions in your application adhere to the same error handling conventions.
- **Granularity**: Decide on the level of detail to include in error reasons. More detailed errors can aid in debugging but may also expose internal details.
- **Documentation**: Clearly document the expected return values and error reasons for each function to aid other developers in understanding and using your code.

### Elixir Unique Features

Elixir's pattern matching and immutability make it particularly well-suited for error handling with tagged tuples. The language's emphasis on functional programming encourages developers to write pure functions that return consistent results, further enhancing the effectiveness of these patterns.

### Differences and Similarities

While similar patterns exist in other functional languages, Elixir's use of tagged tuples is unique in its integration with the language's pattern matching capabilities. This combination allows for more expressive and concise error handling compared to languages that rely on exceptions or other mechanisms.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Experiment with different error scenarios**: Modify the `Math.divide/2` function to handle additional error cases, such as invalid input types.
- **Enhance the HTTPClient module**: Add support for handling redirects or other HTTP status codes.
- **Create your own module**: Implement a module that performs a series of operations, each returning `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`, and chain them together using pattern matching.

### Knowledge Check

Before we conclude, let's review some key takeaways:

- **Tagged tuples provide a consistent way** to represent success and failure in Elixir.
- **Pattern matching simplifies error handling** by allowing developers to destructure and handle results in a concise manner.
- **Clear error propagation and easier debugging** are among the primary benefits of using these patterns.
