## 13.12. Monitoring and Logging Strategies

In the world of software engineering, especially when dealing with distributed systems and microservices, monitoring and logging are crucial components for maintaining system health and performance. Elixir, with its robust concurrency model and fault-tolerant design, offers unique opportunities and challenges in implementing effective monitoring and logging strategies. In this section, we will explore advanced techniques for centralized monitoring, configuring alerting systems, and establishing logging best practices in Elixir applications.

### Centralized Monitoring

Centralized monitoring involves aggregating metrics from multiple services into a single, cohesive view. This approach allows for comprehensive insights into the performance and health of your entire system.

#### Aggregating Metrics from Multiple Services

To effectively monitor an Elixir application, it's essential to collect and aggregate metrics from various services. This can include metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, and error rates.

**Prometheus and Grafana**

Prometheus is a powerful open-source monitoring solution that can be used to collect metrics from Elixir applications. Grafana, on the other hand, is a visualization tool that can be used to create dashboards for these metrics.

```elixir
# Example of using Prometheus with Elixir

defmodule MyApp.Metrics do
  use Prometheus.PlugExporter

  def setup do
    # Define a counter metric
    Prometheus.Metric.Counter.declare(
      name: :http_requests_total,
      help: "Total number of HTTP requests"
    )

    # Increment the counter
    Prometheus.Metric.Counter.inc(name: :http_requests_total)
  end
end
```

In the above example, we define a counter metric to track the total number of HTTP requests. This metric can then be scraped by Prometheus and visualized using Grafana.

**Visualizing Metrics with Grafana**

To visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus, you can use Grafana to create dashboards. Grafana provides a user-friendly interface to create graphs and alerts based on the metrics data.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Prometheus] -->|Scrapes Metrics| B[Elixir Application];
    B -->|Exports Metrics| C[Grafana];
    C -->|Visualizes Data| D[User Dashboard];
```

#### Implementing Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing is another critical component of centralized monitoring. It helps in tracking requests as they flow through different services in a distributed system. OpenTelemetry is a popular choice for implementing distributed tracing in Elixir.

```elixir
# Example of setting up OpenTelemetry in Elixir

defmodule MyApp.Tracer do
  use OpenTelemetry.Tracer

  def start_trace do
    OpenTelemetry.Tracer.with_span "my_span" do
      # Perform operations within the trace
    end
  end
end
```

By using OpenTelemetry, you can gain insights into the performance of individual services and identify bottlenecks in your system.

### Alerting Systems

Alerting systems are essential for notifying developers and operators about critical system events. Properly configured alerts can help in quickly identifying and resolving issues before they impact users.

#### Configuring Alerts for Critical System Events

Alerts should be configured to notify the relevant teams about critical events such as high error rates, increased latency, or resource exhaustion.

**Using Alertmanager with Prometheus**

Alertmanager is a component of the Prometheus ecosystem that handles alerts. It can be configured to send notifications via email, Slack, or other communication channels.

```yaml
# Example Alertmanager configuration

route:
  receiver: "team_notifications"

receivers:
  - name: "team_notifications"
    email_configs:
      - to: "team@example.com"
        from: "alertmanager@example.com"
        smarthost: "smtp.example.com:587"
```

In this configuration, alerts are sent to the specified email address whenever a critical event occurs.

**Creating Custom Alerts**

Custom alerts can be created based on specific metrics or conditions. For example, you can create an alert for high memory usage in an Elixir application.

```yaml
# Prometheus alert rule for high memory usage

groups:
  - name: memory_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: node_memory_Active_bytes > 1e+09
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High memory usage detected"
          description: "Memory usage is above 1GB for more than 5 minutes."
```

This alert rule triggers when memory usage exceeds 1GB for more than 5 minutes, notifying the team to investigate the issue.

### Logging Best Practices

Logging is an essential part of monitoring and debugging applications. Well-structured logs provide valuable insights into application behavior and help in diagnosing issues.

#### Structuring Logs for Readability and Analysis

Logs should be structured in a way that makes them easy to read and analyze. This includes using consistent formats, including relevant context, and avoiding excessive verbosity.

**Using Logger in Elixir**

Elixir's built-in `Logger` module provides a simple and effective way to log messages. It supports different log levels such as `:debug`, `:info`, `:warn`, and `:error`.

```elixir
# Example of using Logger in Elixir

defmodule MyApp.LoggerExample do
  require Logger

  def log_message do
    Logger.info("This is an informational message")
    Logger.error("This is an error message")
  end
end
```

In this example, we log messages at different levels using the `Logger` module.

**Structured Logging with JSON**

Structured logging involves formatting log messages in a structured format such as JSON. This makes it easier to parse and analyze logs using tools like Elasticsearch and Kibana.

```elixir
# Example of structured logging with JSON

defmodule MyApp.StructuredLogger do
  require Logger

  def log_structured_message do
    Logger.info(fn ->
      Jason.encode!(%{
        event: "user_login",
        user_id: 123,
        timestamp: DateTime.utc_now()
      })
    end)
  end
end
```

By logging messages in JSON format, you can easily search and filter logs based on specific fields.

**Centralized Log Management**

Centralized log management involves aggregating logs from multiple services into a single location for analysis. Tools like Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK stack) are commonly used for this purpose.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Elixir Application] -->|Logs| B[Logstash];
    B -->|Processes Logs| C[Elasticsearch];
    C -->|Stores Logs| D[Kibana];
    D -->|Visualizes Logs| E[User Interface];
```
