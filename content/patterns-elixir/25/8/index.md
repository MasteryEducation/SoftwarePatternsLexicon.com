## 25.8. Configuration Management

In the realm of Elixir development, configuration management is a cornerstone for building scalable, maintainable, and secure applications. As systems grow in complexity, managing configurations dynamically and securely becomes paramount. This section delves into the intricacies of configuration management in Elixir, focusing on dynamic configurations, secrets management, and the integration of powerful tools like Consul and Vault.

### Dynamic Configurations

Dynamic configurations allow applications to adapt to different environments and conditions without requiring code changes. This flexibility is crucial for deploying applications across various stages, such as development, testing, and production.

#### Using Environment Variables

Environment variables are a common method for managing configurations dynamically. They provide a simple way to inject configuration values into your application at runtime.

**Example: Setting Environment Variables**

```bash
# Setting environment variables in a Unix-based system
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost/db_name"
export SECRET_KEY_BASE="your_secret_key"
```

**Accessing Environment Variables in Elixir**

In Elixir, you can access environment variables using the `System.get_env/1` function.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Config do
  def database_url do
    System.get_env("DATABASE_URL")
  end

  def secret_key_base do
    System.get_env("SECRET_KEY_BASE")
  end
end
```

**Advantages of Using Environment Variables**

- **Portability:** Easily move configurations between environments.
- **Security:** Keep sensitive information out of source code.
- **Flexibility:** Change configurations without redeploying the application.

#### Runtime Configuration

Elixir provides robust support for runtime configuration through the `config/runtime.exs` file. This file is evaluated at runtime, allowing you to tailor configurations based on the environment.

**Example: Using `config/runtime.exs`**

```elixir
import Config

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  url: System.get_env("DATABASE_URL"),
  pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") || "10")
```

**Benefits of Runtime Configuration**

- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Modify configurations based on runtime conditions.
- **Environment-Specific Settings:** Customize settings for different deployment environments.

### Secrets Management

Managing secrets securely is critical to protect sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. Elixir applications can leverage various strategies and tools to handle secrets effectively.

#### Securely Managing Sensitive Configurations

**Principles of Secrets Management**

1. **Minimize Exposure:** Limit the number of places where secrets are stored.
2. **Access Control:** Restrict access to secrets based on roles and responsibilities.
3. **Audit and Monitor:** Track access and changes to secrets for security audits.

**Using Encrypted Secrets**

Elixir's `:crypto` module can be used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Encryption do
  @key :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(32)

  def encrypt(data) do
    :crypto.block_encrypt(:aes_gcm, @key, <<>>, data)
  end

  def decrypt(encrypted_data) do
    :crypto.block_decrypt(:aes_gcm, @key, <<>>, encrypted_data)
  end
end
```

**Key Management**

- **Rotate Keys Regularly:** Change encryption keys periodically to reduce the risk of exposure.
- **Store Keys Securely:** Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services (KMS) for storing keys.

### Consul and Vault Integration

Integrating tools like Consul and Vault can enhance your application's configuration management capabilities, especially in distributed systems.

#### Leveraging Consul for Distributed Configuration Management

Consul is a service mesh solution that provides service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionality.

**Using Consul for Configuration**

Consul can store configuration data in key-value pairs, which can be accessed by your Elixir application.

**Example: Fetching Configuration from Consul**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ConsulConfig do
  @consul_url "http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/"

  def get_config(key) do
    url = "#{@consul_url}#{key}"
    {:ok, response} = HTTPoison.get(url)
    response.body |> Jason.decode!() |> List.first() |> Map.get("Value") |> Base.decode64!()
  end
end
```

**Benefits of Using Consul**

- **Centralized Configuration:** Manage configurations from a single location.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Automatically update configurations across services.

#### Vault for Secrets Management

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. It provides a unified interface to any secret while maintaining tight access control and logging a detailed audit trail.

**Integrating Vault with Elixir**

To use Vault in Elixir, you can leverage libraries like `ex_vault`.

**Example: Accessing Secrets from Vault**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Vault do
  @vault_url "http://localhost:8200/v1/secret/data/myapp"

  def get_secret(key) do
    {:ok, response} = HTTPoison.get("#{@vault_url}/#{key}")
    response.body |> Jason.decode!() |> Map.get("data") |> Map.get("data") |> Map.get(key)
  end
end
```

**Advantages of Using Vault**

- **Secure Secret Storage:** Store secrets securely with encryption.
- **Access Policies:** Define who can access which secrets.
- **Audit Logging:** Keep track of secret access and modifications.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by modifying them to suit your application's needs. Try integrating Consul and Vault into a sample Elixir application to see how they can enhance your configuration management strategy.

### Visualizing Configuration Management

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of configuration management in an Elixir application using Consul and Vault.

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[Load Environment Variables]
    B --> C{Use Runtime Config}
    C -->|Yes| D[Load from config/runtime.exs]
    C -->|No| E[Use Default Config]
    D --> F[Access Consul for Config]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Access Vault for Secrets]
    G --> H[Application Runs with Config]
```

**Diagram Description:** This flowchart shows how an Elixir application loads configurations. It starts by loading environment variables, checks if runtime configuration is used, accesses Consul for additional configurations, and retrieves secrets from Vault before running the application.
