## 25.4. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development, enabling teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. In the context of Elixir, CI/CD can significantly enhance the development workflow by automating the build, test, and deployment processes. This section will guide you through setting up CI/CD pipelines, using popular tools, and implementing best practices to ensure seamless integration and deployment in your Elixir projects.

### Setting Up Pipelines

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline involves automating the processes of building, testing, and deploying your application. This automation helps in catching bugs early, reducing integration issues, and ensuring that your code is always in a deployable state.

#### Automating Build, Test, and Deployment Processes

1. **Build Automation**: Automate the compilation of your Elixir code using tools like Mix. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the code compiles without errors.

2. **Test Automation**: Use ExUnit to automate your test suite. Ensure that all tests are run on every commit to catch regressions early. Consider using property-based testing with tools like StreamData for more comprehensive test coverage.

3. **Deployment Automation**: Automate the deployment process using tools like Distillery or Mix Releases. Ensure that your application is deployed in a consistent and repeatable manner.

```elixir
# Example of a simple Elixir build script using Mix
defmodule BuildScript do
  def run do
    Mix.Task.run("deps.get")
    Mix.Task.run("compile")
    Mix.Task.run("test")
  end
end
```

### Tools for CI/CD

Several tools can help you implement CI/CD in your Elixir projects. Each tool has its strengths and can be chosen based on your specific needs and infrastructure.

#### Jenkins

Jenkins is a widely used open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating any project. It offers a rich ecosystem of plugins and can be integrated with various tools and services.

- **Pipeline as Code**: Jenkins allows you to define your build pipeline as code using Jenkinsfile, which can be versioned alongside your application code.
- **Plugins**: Utilize Jenkins plugins for integration with Git, Docker, and other tools.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mix deps.get'
                sh 'mix compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mix test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'mix release'
                // Add deployment steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is a powerful tool integrated into GitLab, providing a seamless experience for managing your CI/CD pipelines.

- **YAML Configuration**: Define your CI/CD pipeline using a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which is easy to read and maintain.
- **Built-in Docker Support**: GitLab CI/CD has excellent support for Docker, making it easy to build and deploy containerized applications.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mix deps.get
    - mix compile

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - mix test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - mix release
    # Add deployment steps here
```

#### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, allowing you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository.

- **Workflow Files**: Define workflows using YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory.
- **Marketplace**: Access a marketplace of pre-built actions to extend your workflows.

```yaml
name: Elixir CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Elixir
        uses: actions/setup-elixir@v1
        with:
          elixir-version: '1.11'
      - run: mix deps.get
      - run: mix compile
      - run: mix test
```

### Best Practices for CI/CD

Implementing best practices in your CI/CD pipelines can help ensure that your deployments are reliable and efficient.

#### Incremental Deployments

Incremental deployments involve deploying only the changes made since the last deployment, reducing the risk of introducing errors and minimizing downtime.

- **Feature Toggles**: Use feature toggles to deploy incomplete features without exposing them to users.
- **Canary Releases**: Deploy changes to a small subset of users before rolling out to the entire user base.

#### Blue-Green Deployments

Blue-green deployments involve maintaining two identical production environments (blue and green). At any time, one environment is live, while the other is idle. This approach allows for zero-downtime deployments and easy rollbacks.

- **Traffic Switching**: Use a load balancer to switch traffic between the blue and green environments.
- **Rollback Strategy**: In case of issues, switch back to the previous environment without downtime.

### Visualizing CI/CD Pipelines

Visualizing your CI/CD pipeline can help you understand the flow of your build, test, and deployment processes. Below is a simple flowchart representing a typical CI/CD pipeline.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Code Commit] --> B[Build]
    B --> C[Test]
    C --> D{Deploy}
    D -->|Success| E[Production]
    D -->|Failure| F[Rollback]
```

### Elixir-Specific Considerations

Elixir's unique features, such as its concurrency model and fault-tolerance, can be leveraged in your CI/CD pipelines.

- **Concurrent Testing**: Utilize Elixir's concurrency features to run tests in parallel, reducing the time taken to execute your test suite.
- **Fault-Tolerant Deployments**: Design your deployment process to handle failures gracefully, leveraging Elixir's "let it crash" philosophy.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Languages

While CI/CD principles are consistent across languages, Elixir's functional nature and concurrency model offer unique advantages.

- **Functional Pipelines**: Use Elixir's pipe operator (`|>`) to create clean and readable build scripts.
- **Process Isolation**: Leverage Elixir's lightweight processes to isolate different stages of your pipeline.
