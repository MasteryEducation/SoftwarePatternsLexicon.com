## 25.6. Deployment Strategies and Tools

Deploying Elixir applications efficiently and reliably is crucial for maintaining high availability and performance. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of deployment strategies and tools, focusing on release management, deployment automation, and achieving zero-downtime deployments. By mastering these concepts, you can ensure that your Elixir applications are robust, scalable, and resilient.

### Release Management

Release management is a critical aspect of deploying Elixir applications. It involves building, packaging, and distributing your application in a way that is easy to deploy and manage. In Elixir, release management is typically handled using tools like Mix and Distillery.

#### Building Releases with Mix

Mix is the build tool that comes with Elixir, and it provides a powerful way to manage your application's dependencies, compile your code, and build releases. A release is a self-contained package that includes your compiled application, its dependencies, and the Erlang runtime.

To build a release with Mix, you can use the `mix release` command. Here's a basic example:

```elixir
# In your project directory, run:
mix release

# This will create a release in the _build directory.
```

The `mix release` command generates a release configuration file, which you can customize to suit your needs. This file allows you to specify environment-specific settings, such as configuration files, environment variables, and more.

#### Distillery for Advanced Release Management

Distillery is a popular tool for building releases in Elixir. It provides more advanced features than Mix, such as hot upgrades, which allow you to upgrade your application without stopping it. Distillery also supports custom release configurations and hooks, making it a powerful tool for managing complex deployments.

To use Distillery, you need to add it to your project's dependencies and configure it in your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:distillery, "~> 2.1"}
  ]
end
```

Once you've added Distillery, you can create a release with the following command:

```elixir
# Create a release with Distillery
mix distillery.release

# This will generate a release in the _build directory.
```

Distillery allows you to define custom release configurations in the `rel/config.exs` file. You can specify different configurations for different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

### Deployment Automation

Deployment automation is essential for ensuring that your applications are deployed consistently and reliably. By automating the deployment process, you can reduce the risk of human error, speed up deployments, and improve the overall efficiency of your development workflow.

#### Scripts and Tools for Deployment Automation

There are several tools and scripts you can use to automate the deployment of Elixir applications. Some popular options include:

- **Ansible**: A powerful automation tool that can be used to manage server configurations, deploy applications, and orchestrate complex workflows.
- **Chef**: A configuration management tool that allows you to define your infrastructure as code, making it easy to automate deployments and manage server configurations.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a single container, making it easy to deploy and run on any environment.

Here's an example of a simple deployment script using Ansible:

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Elixir application
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Pull latest code from Git
      git:
        repo: 'https://github.com/your-repo/elixir-app.git'
        dest: /var/www/elixir-app

    - name: Build release
      shell: mix release
      args:
        chdir: /var/www/elixir-app

    - name: Restart application
      systemd:
        name: elixir-app
        state: restarted
```

This script pulls the latest code from a Git repository, builds a release using Mix, and restarts the application using systemd.

### Zero-Downtime Deployments

Zero-downtime deployments are crucial for maintaining high availability and ensuring that your users experience no interruptions during deployments. There are several strategies you can use to achieve zero-downtime deployments in Elixir.

#### Strategies for Zero-Downtime Deployments

1. **Blue-Green Deployments**: This strategy involves maintaining two identical environments, known as blue and green. At any given time, one environment is live, while the other is idle. During a deployment, the new version of the application is deployed to the idle environment. Once the deployment is complete and tested, traffic is switched to the new environment, ensuring zero downtime.

2. **Canary Releases**: In a canary release, the new version of the application is deployed to a small subset of users first. This allows you to test the new version in a production environment with minimal risk. If the new version performs well, it is gradually rolled out to the rest of the users.

3. **Rolling Deployments**: In a rolling deployment, the new version of the application is deployed to a small number of servers at a time. Once the deployment is successful on those servers, it is gradually rolled out to the rest of the servers. This ensures that there is always a portion of the application running, minimizing downtime.

#### Implementing Zero-Downtime Deployments with Distillery

Distillery supports hot upgrades, which allow you to upgrade your application without stopping it. This is achieved by generating a release upgrade package that contains only the changes between the old and new versions of the application.

To create a hot upgrade with Distillery, you need to generate an upgrade package using the `mix distillery.release --upgrade` command:

```elixir
# Generate an upgrade package
mix distillery.release --upgrade

# This will create an upgrade package in the _build directory.
```

Once the upgrade package is generated, you can apply it to your running application using the `bin/<app_name> upgrade <version>` command:

```bash
# Apply the upgrade package
bin/my_app upgrade 0.1.1
```

This command will apply the upgrade package to your running application, ensuring zero downtime.

### Visualizing Deployment Strategies

To better understand the deployment strategies discussed, let's visualize the blue-green deployment strategy using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Current Production Environment (Blue)] -->|Deploy New Version| B[Idle Environment (Green)];
    B -->|Test New Version| C{Is New Version Stable?};
    C -->|Yes| D[Switch Traffic to Green];
    C -->|No| E[Rollback to Blue];
    D --> F[Green Becomes Production];
    E --> F;
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the blue-green deployment strategy. The current production environment (Blue) is running, while the new version is deployed to the idle environment (Green). If the new version is stable, traffic is switched to Green, making it the new production environment.
