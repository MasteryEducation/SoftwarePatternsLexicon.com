Cross-validation is a robust model evaluation method used widely in machine learning and neural networks. This technique splits the dataset into k folds, iteratively training and validating the model, to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

## Detailed Description

Cross-validation is primarily used to assess the performance of a machine learning model and understand how it will generalize to an independent dataset. By splitting the data into k subsets (or "folds"), each fold acts as both a training set and a validation set at different iterations. This prevents overfitting and gives a more reliable measure of model performance.

### Types of Cross-Validation

1. **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: The data is divided into k subsets of equal size. For each of k iterations, one fold is used as the validation set, and the remaining k-1 folds are used as the training set.
2. **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**: A variation of k-fold that ensures each fold has a similar distribution of classes as the entire dataset.
3. **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**: A special case where k equals the number of data points, meaning each data point is used once as a validation set.
4. **Time Series Cross-Validation**: Special method for time series data where folds respect temporal order.

## Examples in Different Programming Languages

### Python

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def cross_validate(model, X, y, k):
    kf = KFold(n_splits=k)
    accuracies = []
    for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
        X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
        y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        accuracies.append(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
    return accuracies
```

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.descriptive.moment.Mean;

public class CrossValidation {
    public static double[] crossValidate(Model model, double[][] X, double[] y, int k) {
        KFold kf = new KFold(k, X.length);
        double[] accuracies = new double[k];
        int foldIndex = 0;
        for (Fold fold : kf) {
            model.fit(X[fold.trainIndices], y[fold.trainIndices]);
            double[] predictions = model.predict(X[fold.testIndices]);
            accuracies[foldIndex++] = accuracy(y[fold.testIndices], predictions);
        }
        return accuracies;
    }

    private static double accuracy(double[] yTrue, double[] yPred) {
        int correct = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < yTrue.length; i++) {
            if (yTrue[i] == yPred[i]) correct++;
        }
        return (double) correct / yTrue.length;
    }
}
```

### Scala

```scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.MulticlassClassificationEvaluator
import org.apache.spark.ml.Model

def crossValidate(model: Model, data: DataFrame, k: Int): Array[Double] = {
  val kf = new KFold(k, data.count().toInt)
  val accuracies = for (fold <- kf) yield {
    val trainingSet = data.filter(!fold.testIndices.contains(_))
    val testSet = data.filter(fold.testIndices.contains(_))
    val fittedModel = model.fit(trainingSet)
    val predictions = fittedModel.transform(testSet)
    val evaluator = new MulticlassClassificationEvaluator().setMetricName("accuracy")
    evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
  }
  accuracies.toArray
}
```

### Clojure

```clojure
(require '[clojure.data.csv :as csv]
         '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(defn cross-validate [model data k]
  (let [kf (k-fold data k)]
    (for [fold kf]
      (let [training-set (map #(data %) (remove fold test-indices))
            test-set (map #(data %) (fold test-indices))]
        (let [trained-model (train model training-set)]
          (accuracy (predict trained-model test-set) (actual test-set)))))))
