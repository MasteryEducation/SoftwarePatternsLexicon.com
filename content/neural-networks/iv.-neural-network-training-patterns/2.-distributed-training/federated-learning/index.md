## Federated Learning: Training Across Decentralized Data

Federated Learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables models to be trained across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging their data. This approach enhances data privacy and security by ensuring that raw data remains local.

### Benefits of Federated Learning

- **Privacy-Preserving:** Sensitive data never leaves the user's device, minimizing data exposure.
- **Reduced Latency:** Training occurs locally, reducing the time needed to transfer data.
- **Scalability:** Distributed training allows scaling to many devices.
- **Compliance:** Helps meet regulations like GDPR by keeping data local.

### Trade-offs

- **Communication Overhead:** Synchronizing model updates across multiple devices can be bandwidth-intensive.
- **Complexity:** Managing distributed training and ensuring model convergence adds complexity.
- **Resource Constraints:** Local devices may have limited computational power and memory.

### Use Cases

- **Mobile Keyboard Predictions:** Training predictive text models on mobile devices without accessing users' texts.
- **Healthcare:** Federated learning on patient data across hospitals without sharing sensitive health information.
- **IoT Devices:** Enhancing smart home devices using local data while maintaining user privacy.

### Example Implementations

#### Python

```python
import numpy as np

class LocalModel:
    def __init__(self, weights):
        self.weights = weights

    def train(self, local_data):
        # Perform local training
        for data_point in local_data:
            self.weights += 0.1 * (data_point - self.weights)

class FederatedServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.global_model = np.zeros(10)

    def aggregate(self, local_models):
        self.global_model = np.mean([model.weights for model in local_models], axis=0)

local_data1 = np.random.rand(10)
local_data2 = np.random.rand(10)
local_model1 = LocalModel(np.random.rand(10))
local_model2 = LocalModel(np.random.rand(10))

server = FederatedServer()

local_model1.train(local_data1)
local_model2.train(local_data2)

server.aggregate([local_model1, local_model2])
print("Global model weights: ", server.global_model)
```

#### Java

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class LocalModel {
    private double[] weights;

    public LocalModel(double[] weights) {
        this.weights = weights;
    }

    public void train(double[] localData) {
        // Perform local training
        for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            weights[i] += 0.1 * (localData[i] - weights[i]);
        }
    }

    public double[] getWeights() {
        return weights;
    }
}

class FederatedServer {
    private double[] globalModel;

    public FederatedServer() {
        globalModel = new double[10];
    }

    public void aggregate(List<LocalModel> localModels) {
        for (int i = 0; i < globalModel.length; i++) {
            globalModel[i] = localModels.stream().mapToDouble(m -> m.getWeights()[i]).average().orElse(0);
        }
    }

    public double[] getGlobalModel() {
        return globalModel;
    }
}

// Simulation
public class FederatedLearning {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] localData1 = new double[10];
        double[] localData2 = new double[10];
        LocalModel localModel1 = new LocalModel(localData1);
        LocalModel localModel2 = new LocalModel(localData2);

        FederatedServer server = new FederatedServer();

        // Local training
        localModel1.train(localData1);
        localModel2.train(localData2);

        // Server aggregation
        List<LocalModel> models = new ArrayList<>();
        models.add(localModel1);
        models.add(localModel2);
        server.aggregate(models);
        System.out.println("Global model weights: " + Arrays.toString(server.getGlobalModel()));
    }
}
```

#### Scala

```scala
object FederatedLearning {
  class LocalModel(var weights: Array[Double]) {
    def train(localData: Array[Double]): Unit = {
      // Perform local training
      weights.indices.foreach { i =>
        weights(i) += 0.1 * (localData(i) - weights(i))
      }
    }
  }

  class FederatedServer {
    var globalModel: Array[Double] = Array.fill(10)(0.0)

    def aggregate(localModels: List[LocalModel]): Unit = {
      globalModel = localModels.map(_.weights).transpose.map(_.sum / localModels.length)
    }
  }

  // Simulation
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val localData1 = Array.fill(10)(scala.util.Random.nextDouble())
    val localData2 = Array.fill(10)(scala.util.Random.nextDouble())

    val localModel1 = new LocalModel(localData1)
    val localModel2 = new LocalModel(localData2)

    val server = new FederatedServer

    // Local training
    localModel1.train(localData1)
    localModel2.train(localData2)

    // Server aggregation
    server.aggregate(List(localModel1, localModel2))
    println("Global model weights: " + server.globalModel.mkString(", "))
  }
}
```

#### Clojure

```clojure
(defn train-local-model [weights local-data]
  (mapv (fn [w d] (+ w (* 0.1 (- d w)))) weights local-data))

(defn aggregate-models [models]
  (mapv #(/ (reduce + %) (count models)) (apply map vector models)))

;; Simulation
(let [local-data1 (repeatedly 10 #(rand))
      local-data2 (repeatedly 10 #(rand))
      local-model1 (atom (repeatedly 10 #(rand)))
      local-model2 (atom (repeatedly 10 #(rand)))]

  ;; Local training
  (reset! local-model1 (train-local-model @local-model1 local-data1))
  (reset! local-model2 (train-local-model @local-model2 local-data2))

  ;; Server aggregation
  (let [global-model (aggregate-models [@local-model1 @local-model2])]
    (println "Global model weights:" global-model)))
```
