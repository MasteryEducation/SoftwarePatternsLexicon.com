## Link Prediction: Predicting Missing Links in Graphs

Link Prediction is a neural network design pattern that focuses on predicting missing links in a graph. This pattern has significant applications in recommendation systems, social network analysis, biological network analysis, and more.

### Overview

Link prediction aims to infer the likelihood of a future or missing connection between nodes in a graph. By leveraging the structure and properties of the graph, this pattern helps in making data-driven predictions about node relationships.

### Use Cases

- **Recommendation Systems:** Predicting the likelihood of user-item interactions.
- **Social Networks:** Predicting friendship or follower links between users.
- **Biological Networks:** Inferring possible interactions between proteins or genes.

        +id: int
        +features: List[float]
    }

    class Edge {
        +source: Node
        +target: Node
        +weight: float
    }

    class Graph {
        +nodes: List[Node]
        +edges: List[Edge]
        +addNode(node: Node): void
        +addEdge(edge: Edge): void
        +predictLink(node1: Node, node2: Node): float
    }

    class LinkPredictionModel {
        +train(graph: Graph, labels: List[int]): void
        +predict(graph: Graph, nodePair: Tuple[Node, Node]): float
    }

    Graph --* Node
    Graph --* Edge
    LinkPredictionModel --* Graph
```

### Implementation Examples

#### Python Example

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

class LinkPredictionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LogisticRegression()

    def train(self, graph, labels):
        X = self._extract_features(graph)
        self.model.fit(X, labels)

    def predict(self, graph, node_pair):
        X = self._extract_features(graph, node_pair)
        return self.model.predict_proba(X)[0, 1]

    def _extract_features(self, graph, node_pair=None):
        # Implementation of feature extraction from graph
        # For simplicity, using a placeholder here
        return np.random.rand(1, 10)

graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)])
model = LinkPredictionModel()
model.train(graph, [1, 0, 1])  # Sample training labels
prediction = model.predict(graph, (0, 2))
print(f"Prediction Score: {prediction}")
```

#### Java Example

```java

import org.jgrapht.graph.*;
import weka.classifiers.functions.Logistic;
import weka.core.*;

public class LinkPredictionModel {
    private Logistic model;

    public LinkPredictionModel() {
        this.model = new Logistic();
    }

    public void train(Graph<Integer, DefaultEdge> graph, int[] labels) throws Exception {
        Instances data = extractFeatures(graph, labels.length);
        this.model.buildClassifier(data);
    }

    public double predict(Graph<Integer, DefaultEdge> graph, Pair<Integer, Integer> nodePair) throws Exception {
        Instance instance = extractFeatureInstance(graph, nodePair);
        return this.model.distributionForInstance(instance)[1];
    }

    private Instances extractFeatures(Graph<Integer, DefaultEdge> graph, int numInstances) {
        // Feature extraction logic
        // Placeholder implementation
        return new Instances("Rel", new FastVector(), numInstances);
    }

    private Instance extractFeatureInstance(Graph<Integer, DefaultEdge> graph, Pair<Integer, Integer> nodePair) {
        // Feature extraction logic
        // Placeholder implementation
        return new DenseInstance(1.0, new double[10]);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Graph<Integer, DefaultEdge> graph = new SimpleGraph<>(DefaultEdge.class);
        graph.addEdge(0, 1);
        graph.addEdge(1, 2);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3);

        LinkPredictionModel model = new LinkPredictionModel();
        model.train(graph, new int[]{1, 0, 1});

        double prediction = model.predict(graph, new Pair<>(0, 2));
        System.out.println("Prediction Score: " + prediction);
    }
}
```
