## Introduction

Graph classification is a design pattern used in neural networks for predicting the category of entire graphs. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the data can be naturally represented as graphs, such as in molecular property prediction, social network analysis, and recommendation systems.

## Detailed Description

Graph classification involves assigning a label to an entire graph rather than to individual nodes or edges. The challenge lies in handling the variable size and complex structure of graphs. State-of-the-art methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promising results in this domain.

## UML Class Diagram

Here's a UML Class Diagram for the Graph Classification design pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Graph {
        +List<Node> nodes
        +List<Edge> edges
        +Graph(adjMatrix: int[][])
        +addNode(node: Node): void
        +addEdge(edge: Edge): void
    }
    
    class Node {
        +int id
        +String label
        +Node(id: int, label: String)
    }

    class Edge {
        +Node from
        +Node to
        +Edge(from: Node, to: Node)
    }

    class GraphClassifier {
        +train(Graph[], labels: int[]): void
        +predict(Graph): int
    }

    Graph --* Node
    Graph --* Edge
    GraphClassifier ..> Graph : uses
```

## UML Sequence Diagram

Here's a UML Sequence Diagram showing the interaction for training and predicting with a Graph Classifier:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant GraphClassifier
    participant Graph
    participant Node
    participant Edge

    Client->>+GraphClassifier: initialize()
    Client->>+Graph: createGraph()
    Graph->>Node: createNode(id, label)
    Graph->>Edge: createEdge(from, to)
    Client->>GraphClassifier: train(Graph[], labels)
    Client->>GraphClassifier: predict(Graph)
    GraphClassifier-->>Client: prediction
```

## Examples in Different Languages

### Python

```python
import networkx as nx
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

class GraphClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
    
    def train(self, graphs, labels):
        features = [self.extract_features(g) for g in graphs]
        self.model.fit(features, labels)
    
    def predict(self, graph):
        features = self.extract_features(graph)
        return self.model.predict([features])[0]
    
    def extract_features(self, graph):
        # Example feature: node count
        return [len(graph.nodes)]
        
G1 = nx.Graph()
G1.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3)])
G2 = nx.Graph()
G2.add_edges_from([(1, 2)])

clf = GraphClassifier()
clf.train([G1, G2], [0, 1])
prediction = clf.predict(G1)
print(f'Prediction: {prediction}')
```

### Java

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import weka.classifiers.trees.RandomForest;
import weka.core.DenseInstance;
import weka.core.Instances;

public class GraphClassifier {
    private RandomForest model;
    
    public GraphClassifier() {
        model = new RandomForest();
    }
    
    public void train(List<Graph> graphs, List<Integer> labels) throws Exception {
        Instances dataset = new Instances("GraphData", new ArrayList<>(), graphs.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < graphs.size(); i++) {
            dataset.add(extractFeatures(graphs.get(i), labels.get(i)));
        }
        model.buildClassifier(dataset);
    }
    
    public double predict(Graph graph) throws Exception {
        return model.classifyInstance(extractFeatures(graph, -1));
    }
    
    private DenseInstance extractFeatures(Graph graph, int label) {
        DenseInstance instance = new DenseInstance(1);
        instance.setValue(0, graph.getNodeCount());
        instance.setClassValue(label);
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Scala

```scala
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer

class GraphClassifier {
    private val model = new RandomForestClassifier()
    
    def train(graphs: Seq[Graph], labels: Seq[Int]): Unit = {
        val features = graphs.map(extractFeatures)
        model.fit(features, labels)
    }
    
    def predict(graph: Graph): Int = {
        val features = extractFeatures(graph)
        model.predict(features)
    }
    
    private def extractFeatures(graph: Graph): Array[Double] = {
        Array(graph.nodes.size.toDouble)
    }
}

// Usage
val graph1 = new Graph()
graph1.addEdges(Array((1, 2), (2, 3)))

val graph2 = new Graph()
graph2.addEdges(Array((1, 2)))

val classifier = new GraphClassifier()
classifier.train(Seq(graph1, graph2), Seq(0, 1))
val prediction = classifier.predict(graph1)
println(s"Prediction: $prediction")
```

### Clojure

```clojure
(ns graph-classifier
  (:require [clj-ml.classifiers :as cls]))

(defn extract-features [graph]
  [(.size (:nodes graph))])

(defn train [graphs labels]
  (let [instances (mapv #(assoc {} :attrs (extract-features %) :class (labels %)) graphs)]
    (cls/classifier :random-forest {:train-instances instances})))

(defn predict [classifier graph]
  (cls/classify classifier (extract-features graph)))

;; Usage
(def graph1 {:nodes #{1 2 3} :edges #{[1 2] [2 3]}})
(def graph2 {:nodes #{1 2} :edges #{[1 2]}})

(def classifier (train [graph1 graph2] [0 1]))
(println (predict classifier graph1))
```
