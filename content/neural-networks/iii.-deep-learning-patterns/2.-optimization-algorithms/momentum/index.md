## Introduction
Momentum is a technique in neural networks used to accelerate the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm by considering the past gradients. This helps the model escape local minima more efficiently. By incorporating a fraction of the previous update to the current update, the model gains a momentum effect, which is particularly useful in navigating the complex loss landscapes common in deep learning.

## Detailed Description
The concept of momentum is analogous to the physical term where an object accumulates momentum as it moves, thus gaining speed and energy to push through resistances. In the context of neural networks, the update rule with momentum is given by:

{{< katex >}}
v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta) \nabla \theta J(\theta)
{{< /katex >}}
{{< katex >}}
\theta = \theta - \eta v_t
{{< /katex >}}

Here:
- \\( v_t \\) is the velocity (momentum) term at time \\( t \\).
- \\( \beta \\) is the momentum coefficient.
- \\( \eta \\) is the learning rate.
- \\( \nabla \theta J(\theta) \\) is the gradient of the objective function \\( J \\) with respect to the parameters \\( \theta \\).

## Benefits
- **Accelerated Convergence:** Faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to vanilla gradient descent.
- **Stability:** Reduces the oscillations in the updates, leading to a smoother convergence.
- **Escaping Local Minima:** Helps in escaping shallow local minima and saddle points.

## Trade-offs
- **Complexity:** Adds additional hyperparameter (\\(\beta\\)) that needs tuning.
- **Overshooting:** If the momentum coefficient is too high, it may lead to overshooting the minima.

## Examples

### Python
```python
class MomentumOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate, beta):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.beta = beta
        self.velocity = None

    def update(self, params, gradients):
        if self.velocity is None:
            self.velocity = [0.0 for _ in gradients]

        self.velocity = [self.beta * v + (1 - self.beta) * g for v, g in zip(self.velocity, gradients)]
        return [p - self.learning_rate * v for p, v in zip(params, self.velocity)]
```

### Java
```java
public class MomentumOptimizer {
    private double learningRate;
    private double beta;
    private double[] velocity;

    public MomentumOptimizer(double learningRate, double beta) {
        this.learningRate = learningRate;
        this.beta = beta;
        this.velocity = null;
    }

    public double[] update(double[] params, double[] gradients) {
        if (velocity == null) {
            velocity = new double[gradients.length];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < gradients.length; i++) {
            velocity[i] = beta * velocity[i] + (1 - beta) * gradients[i];
            params[i] -= learningRate * velocity[i];
        }
        return params;
    }
}
```

### Scala
```scala
class MomentumOptimizer(learningRate: Double, beta: Double) {
  private var velocity: Option[Array[Double]] = None

  def update(params: Array[Double], gradients: Array[Double]): Array[Double] = {
    if (velocity.isEmpty) {
      velocity = Some(Array.fill(gradients.length)(0.0))
    }

    for (i <- gradients.indices) {
      velocity.get(i) = beta * velocity.get(i) + (1 - beta) * gradients(i)
      params(i) -= learningRate * velocity.get(i)
    }
    params
  }
}
```

### Clojure
```clojure
(defn momentum-optimizer [learning-rate beta]
  (let [velocity (atom nil)]
    (fn [params gradients]
      (when-not @velocity
        (reset! velocity (vec (repeat (count gradients) 0.0))))
      (reset! velocity (mapv (fn [v g] (+ (* beta v) (* (- 1 beta) g))) @velocity gradients))
      (mapv (fn [p v] (- p (* learning-rate v))) params @velocity))))
```
