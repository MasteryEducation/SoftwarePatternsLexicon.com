## Overview

Exponential Decay is a design pattern that reduces the learning rate of a neural network exponentially over epochs. This strategy helps in refining the learning process and achieving better convergence in training models.

## Detailed Description

In neural network training, the learning rate is a critical hyperparameter that defines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function. However, a high learning rate can lead to overshooting the minimum, while a low learning rate can slow down the convergence. The Exponential Decay pattern helps in adjusting the learning rate dynamically:

{{< katex >}} \eta_{t} = \eta_{0} \cdot \exp(-\lambda t) {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\(\eta_{t}\\) is the learning rate at epoch \\(t\\).
- \\(\eta_{0}\\) is the initial learning rate.
- \\(\lambda\\) is the decay rate.

        -float learningRate
        -float initialLearningRate
        -float decayRate
        +train(data, epochs)
        -updateLearningRate(epoch)
    }
```

    Trainer ->> NeuralNetwork: create(data, initialLearningRate, decayRate)
    loop epochs
        NeuralNetwork ->> Data: fetchBatch()
        NeuralNetwork ->> NeuralNetwork: updateLearningRate(currentEpoch)
        NeuralNetwork ->> Trainer: trainBatch()
    end
```

## Benefits

- **Improved Convergence:** Gradual decrease in learning rate helps in precise convergence.
- **Enhanced Stability:** Prevents drastic changes in weights by reducing the learning rate exponentially.
- **Controlled Overfitting:** Slower learning rates in later epochs help in avoiding overfitting.

## Trade-offs

- **Computational Overhead:** The function to decrease the learning rate needs to be computed at every epoch.
- **Initial Setup:** Choosing the right initial learning rate and decay factor can be tricky and may require extensive experimentation.

## Examples

### Python

```python
import tensorflow as tf

initial_learning_rate = 0.1
decay_rate = 0.96
global_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)

learning_rate = tf.compat.v1.train.exponential_decay(
    initial_learning_rate, global_step, 100000, decay_rate, staircase=True)

optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate)
```
