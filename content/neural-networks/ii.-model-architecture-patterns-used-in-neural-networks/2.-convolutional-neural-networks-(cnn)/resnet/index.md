Residual Networks (ResNet) revolutionized the training of very deep neural networks by addressing the degradation problem, where the accuracy gets saturated and then degrades rapidly. This is achieved using a novel approach called *residual learning*.

## Introduction to ResNet

ResNet, short for Residual Network, was introduced by Kaiming He et al. in their 2015 paper ["Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). The key innovation of ResNet is the use of *residual blocks* that allow the network to learn residual functions with reference to the layer inputs. This simple yet powerful idea helps in training extremely deep networks, mitigating the degradation problem observed in very deep architectures.

## UML Class Diagram

The UML Class Diagram below represents the high-level architecture of a ResNet.

```mermaid

    class ResNet {
        +forward(x: Tensor): Tensor
    }
    class ResidualBlock {
        +forward(x: Tensor): Tensor
    }
    class ConvLayer {
        +forward(x: Tensor): Tensor
    }
    class ReLULayer {
        +forward(x: Tensor): Tensor
    }

    ResNet --> ResidualBlock
    ResidualBlock --> ConvLayer
    ResidualBlock --> ReLULayer
```

## UML Sequence Diagram

The UML Sequence Diagram below illustrates the flow of data through a residual block in ResNet.

    participant ReLULayer
    participant ConvLayer2
    participant Output

    Input ->> ResidualBlock: forward(x)
    ResidualBlock ->> ConvLayer1: forward(x)
    ConvLayer1 ->> ReLULayer: forward(x)
    ReLULayer ->> ConvLayer2: forward(x)
    ConvLayer2 ->> ResidualBlock: residual(x)
    ResidualBlock ->> Output: x + residual(x)
```

## Detailed Description

### Residual Learning

The core idea behind residual learning is to bypass the traditional mapping using skip connections. In a residual block, the input \\( \mathbf{x} \\) is added directly to the output after passing through several layers, allowing the network to learn the residual mapping \\( \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{H}(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{x} \\), where \\( \mathcal{H}(\mathbf{x}) \\) is the desired underlying mapping.

### Implementation in Different Languages

#### Python

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x
        out = self.conv1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.conv2(out)
        out += residual
        return out

class ResNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_blocks, in_channels):
        super(ResNet, self).__init__()
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([ResidualBlock(in_channels) for _ in range(num_blocks)])
    
    def forward(self, x):
        for block in self.blocks:
            x = block(x)
        return x
```

#### Java

```java
public class ResidualBlock {
    private ConvLayer conv1;
    private ConvLayer conv2;
    private ReLULayer relu;

    public ResidualBlock(int inChannels) {
        this.conv1 = new ConvLayer(inChannels, inChannels, 3);
        this.relu = new ReLULayer();
        this.conv2 = new ConvLayer(inChannels, inChannels, 3);
    }

    public Tensor forward(Tensor x) {
        Tensor residual = x;
        Tensor out = conv1.forward(x);
        out = relu.forward(out);
        out = conv2.forward(out);
        out.add(residual);
        return out;
    }
}

public class ResNet {
    private List<ResidualBlock> blocks;

    public ResNet(int numBlocks, int inChannels) {
        blocks = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numBlocks; i++) {
            blocks.add(new ResidualBlock(inChannels));
        }
    }

    public Tensor forward(Tensor x) {
        for (ResidualBlock block : blocks) {
            x = block.forward(x);
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```

#### Scala

```scala
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer

class ResidualBlock(inChannels: Int) {
  private val conv1 = new ConvLayer(inChannels, inChannels, 3)
  private val relu = new ReLULayer
  private val conv2 = new ConvLayer(inChannels, inChannels, 3)

  def forward(x: Tensor): Tensor = {
    val residual = x
    var out = conv1.forward(x)
    out = relu.forward(out)
    out = conv2.forward(out)
    out.add(residual)
    out
  }
}

class ResNet(numBlocks: Int, inChannels: Int) {
  private val blocks = new ArrayBuffer[ResidualBlock]()

  for (_ <- 0 until numBlocks) {
    blocks += new ResidualBlock(inChannels)
  }

  def forward(x: Tensor): Tensor = {
    var out = x
    for (block <- blocks) {
      out = block.forward(out)
    }
    out
  }
}
```

#### Clojure

```clojure
(defn residual-block [in-channels]
  (let [conv1 (conv-layer in-channels in-channels 3)
        relu  (relu-layer)
        conv2 (conv-layer in-channels in-channels 3)]
    (fn [x]
      (let [residual x
            out      (conv2 (relu (conv1 x)))]
        (add-tensor out residual)))))

(defn resnet [num-blocks in-channels]
  (let [blocks (repeatedly num-blocks #(residual-block in-channels))]
    (fn [x]
      (reduce (fn [out block] (block out)) x blocks))))
```
