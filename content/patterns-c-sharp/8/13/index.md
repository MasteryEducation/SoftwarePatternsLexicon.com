## 8.13 API Composition Pattern

In the world of microservices, where applications are broken down into smaller, independent services, the need to aggregate data from multiple services into a single response becomes crucial. The API Composition Pattern is a design pattern that addresses this need by allowing developers to aggregate data from various microservices and present a unified response to the client. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a client requires data that resides in multiple services.

### Intent

The primary intent of the API Composition Pattern is to provide a mechanism for aggregating data from multiple microservices into a single, cohesive response. This pattern helps in reducing the number of calls a client needs to make to gather all necessary data, thereby improving performance and simplifying client-side logic.

### Key Participants

1. **API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for client requests and orchestrates calls to various microservices.
2. **Composite Service**: A service that aggregates data from multiple microservices and returns a unified response.
3. **Microservices**: Individual services that provide specific pieces of data required by the client.
4. **Client**: The consumer of the aggregated data, which could be a web application, mobile app, or any other client.

### Applicability

The API Composition Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:
- A client needs data from multiple microservices.
- Reducing the number of client-server interactions is desired.
- Simplifying client-side logic is beneficial.
- There is a need to transform or enrich data before presenting it to the client.

### Implementing API Composition in C#

Implementing the API Composition Pattern in C# involves using API Gateways and composite services. Let's explore these components in detail.

#### Using API Gateways

An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices and aggregates the responses. In C#, you can implement an API Gateway using frameworks like Ocelot or Azure API Management.

##### Example: Implementing an API Gateway with Ocelot

Ocelot is a popular open-source API Gateway for .NET. It provides features like routing, request aggregation, and more.

```csharp
// Ocelot configuration example
{
  "Routes": [
    {
      "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/service1/{everything}",
      "DownstreamScheme": "http",
      "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
        {
          "Host": "localhost",
          "Port": 5001
        }
      ],
      "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/service1/{everything}",
      "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get" ]
    },
    {
      "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/service2/{everything}",
      "DownstreamScheme": "http",
      "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
        {
          "Host": "localhost",
          "Port": 5002
        }
      ],
      "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/service2/{everything}",
      "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get" ]
    }
  ],
  "GlobalConfiguration": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:5000"
  }
}
```

In this example, the API Gateway routes requests to two different services based on the URL path. The `UpstreamPathTemplate` defines the path the client uses, while the `DownstreamPathTemplate` specifies the path to the actual service.

#### Composite Services

A composite service is responsible for aggregating data from multiple microservices. It makes calls to the necessary services, combines the data, and returns a single response to the client.

##### Example: Creating a Composite Service in C#

Let's create a simple composite service that aggregates data from two microservices: `UserService` and `OrderService`.

```csharp
public class CompositeService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public CompositeService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<CompositeResponse> GetCompositeDataAsync(int userId)
    {
        var userTask = _httpClient.GetAsync($"http://localhost:5001/api/users/{userId}");
        var ordersTask = _httpClient.GetAsync($"http://localhost:5002/api/orders/user/{userId}");

        await Task.WhenAll(userTask, ordersTask);

        var userResponse = await userTask.Result.Content.ReadAsAsync<User>();
        var ordersResponse = await ordersTask.Result.Content.ReadAsAsync<List<Order>>();

        return new CompositeResponse
        {
            User = userResponse,
            Orders = ordersResponse
        };
    }
}

public class CompositeResponse
{
    public User User { get; set; }
    public List<Order> Orders { get; set; }
}

public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, the `CompositeService` class makes asynchronous calls to `UserService` and `OrderService` to fetch user and order data. It then combines the data into a `CompositeResponse` object.

### Use Cases and Examples

The API Composition Pattern is widely used in various scenarios. Let's explore some common use cases and examples.

#### Use Case 1: E-commerce Platform

In an e-commerce platform, a client might need to display a user's profile along with their recent orders. Instead of making separate calls to `UserService` and `OrderService`, the API Composition Pattern allows the client to make a single call to a composite service that aggregates the data.

#### Use Case 2: Social Media Application

In a social media application, a client might need to display a user's profile, posts, and friends list. The API Composition Pattern can be used to aggregate data from `UserService`, `PostService`, and `FriendService` into a single response.

#### Example: Aggregating Data for Client Consumption

Let's consider a scenario where a client needs to display a dashboard with user information and recent activities. We can use the API Composition Pattern to aggregate data from `UserService` and `ActivityService`.

```csharp
public class DashboardService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public DashboardService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<DashboardResponse> GetDashboardDataAsync(int userId)
    {
        var userTask = _httpClient.GetAsync($"http://localhost:5001/api/users/{userId}");
        var activitiesTask = _httpClient.GetAsync($"http://localhost:5003/api/activities/user/{userId}");

        await Task.WhenAll(userTask, activitiesTask);

        var userResponse = await userTask.Result.Content.ReadAsAsync<User>();
        var activitiesResponse = await activitiesTask.Result.Content.ReadAsAsync<List<Activity>>();

        return new DashboardResponse
        {
            User = userResponse,
            Activities = activitiesResponse
        };
    }
}

public class DashboardResponse
{
    public User User { get; set; }
    public List<Activity> Activities { get; set; }
}

public class Activity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, the `DashboardService` class aggregates user and activity data into a `DashboardResponse` object.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the API Composition Pattern, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Aggregating data from multiple services can introduce latency. Use asynchronous calls and caching to improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage failures in individual service calls.
- **Security**: Ensure that the composite service enforces security policies and access controls.
- **Scalability**: Design the composite service to handle increased load and scale horizontally if necessary.

### Differences and Similarities

The API Composition Pattern is often compared to the **Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern**. While both patterns involve aggregating data for client consumption, the BFF pattern is more focused on tailoring the backend to specific client needs, whereas the API Composition Pattern is more about aggregating data from multiple services.

### Visualizing API Composition

To better understand the API Composition Pattern, let's visualize the flow of data using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant APIGateway
    participant CompositeService
    participant UserService
    participant OrderService

    Client->>APIGateway: Request User and Orders
    APIGateway->>CompositeService: Forward Request
    CompositeService->>UserService: Request User Data
    CompositeService->>OrderService: Request Order Data
    UserService-->>CompositeService: Return User Data
    OrderService-->>CompositeService: Return Order Data
    CompositeService-->>APIGateway: Return Aggregated Data
    APIGateway-->>Client: Return Aggregated Data
```

This diagram illustrates how a client request is processed through an API Gateway, which forwards the request to a composite service. The composite service then makes calls to `UserService` and `OrderService`, aggregates the data, and returns it to the client.
