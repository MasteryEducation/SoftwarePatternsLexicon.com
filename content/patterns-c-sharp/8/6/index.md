## 8.6 Event Sourcing Pattern

The Event Sourcing Pattern is a powerful architectural pattern that stores the state of a service as a sequence of events. This pattern is particularly useful in microservices architecture, where maintaining a clear and auditable history of changes is crucial. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of implementing Event Sourcing in C#, explore its benefits for audit trails and debugging, and examine its use cases in domain-driven design.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Event Sourcing Pattern is to capture all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events. Instead of storing the current state of an entity, each change is recorded as an event. This allows for a complete historical record of changes, enabling the reconstruction of past states and providing a robust audit trail.

### Key Participants

1. **Event Store**: A specialized database that stores events in an append-only fashion.
2. **Event Publisher**: Responsible for publishing events to interested subscribers.
3. **Event Subscribers**: Components that react to events, often updating read models or triggering side effects.
4. **Aggregate**: The domain object that generates events based on business logic.
5. **Command**: An action that triggers changes in the system, resulting in new events.

### Applicability

Event Sourcing is applicable in scenarios where:

- **Auditability**: A complete history of changes is required for compliance or debugging.
- **Complex Business Logic**: Where business rules are complex and require detailed tracking.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Aligns well with DDD by capturing domain events.
- **Rebuilding State**: Ability to rebuild the current state from a sequence of events.

### Implementing Event Sourcing in C#

#### Using Event Store

Event Store is a popular open-source database optimized for event sourcing. It provides a robust platform for storing and retrieving events.

```csharp
// Define an event
public class OrderCreatedEvent
{
    public Guid OrderId { get; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; }
    public string CustomerName { get; }

    public OrderCreatedEvent(Guid orderId, DateTime createdAt, string customerName)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
        CreatedAt = createdAt;
        CustomerName = customerName;
    }
}

// Store an event
var eventStoreConnection = EventStoreConnection.Create(new Uri("tcp://admin:changeit@localhost:1113"));
await eventStoreConnection.ConnectAsync();

var orderCreatedEvent = new OrderCreatedEvent(Guid.NewGuid(), DateTime.UtcNow, "John Doe");
var eventData = new EventData(
    Guid.NewGuid(),
    "OrderCreated",
    true,
    Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(orderCreatedEvent)),
    null);

await eventStoreConnection.AppendToStreamAsync("order-stream", ExpectedVersion.Any, eventData);
```

#### Custom Implementations

For custom implementations, you can use a relational database or NoSQL database to store events. The key is to ensure events are stored in an append-only manner.

```csharp
// Define a custom event store interface
public interface IEventStore
{
    Task SaveEventAsync<T>(string streamName, T @event);
    Task<IEnumerable<T>> GetEventsAsync<T>(string streamName);
}

// Implement the interface using a relational database
public class SqlEventStore : IEventStore
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;

    public SqlEventStore(string connectionString)
    {
        _connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public async Task SaveEventAsync<T>(string streamName, T @event)
    {
        using var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);
        var command = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO Events (StreamName, EventData) VALUES (@StreamName, @EventData)", connection);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@StreamName", streamName);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@EventData", JsonConvert.SerializeObject(@event));
        await connection.OpenAsync();
        await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
    }

    public async Task<IEnumerable<T>> GetEventsAsync<T>(string streamName)
    {
        using var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);
        var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT EventData FROM Events WHERE StreamName = @StreamName", connection);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@StreamName", streamName);
        await connection.OpenAsync();
        using var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync();
        var events = new List<T>();
        while (await reader.ReadAsync())
        {
            var eventData = reader.GetString(0);
            events.Add(JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(eventData));
        }
        return events;
    }
}
```

### Benefits for Audit Trails and Debugging

Event Sourcing provides several benefits for audit trails and debugging:

- **Complete Historical Records**: Every change is recorded, providing a detailed history of all actions.
- **Easier Troubleshooting**: By replaying events, developers can understand the sequence of actions leading to a particular state.
- **Time Travel**: Ability to reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time.
- **Immutable Events**: Events are immutable, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Domain-Driven Design

In domain-driven design (DDD), capturing domain events is crucial for modeling complex business processes. Event Sourcing aligns well with DDD by providing a mechanism to capture and replay domain events.

```csharp
// Define a domain event
public class ProductAddedToCartEvent
{
    public Guid CartId { get; }
    public Guid ProductId { get; }
    public int Quantity { get; }

    public ProductAddedToCartEvent(Guid cartId, Guid productId, int quantity)
    {
        CartId = cartId;
        ProductId = productId;
        Quantity = quantity;
    }
}

// Handle the event in a domain service
public class ShoppingCartService
{
    private readonly IEventStore _eventStore;

    public ShoppingCartService(IEventStore eventStore)
    {
        _eventStore = eventStore;
    }

    public async Task AddProductToCartAsync(Guid cartId, Guid productId, int quantity)
    {
        var @event = new ProductAddedToCartEvent(cartId, productId, quantity);
        await _eventStore.SaveEventAsync("cart-stream", @event);
    }
}
```

#### Rebuilding System State from Events

One of the key advantages of Event Sourcing is the ability to rebuild the system state from events. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the current state is corrupted or lost.

```csharp
// Rebuild the state of a shopping cart from events
public class ShoppingCart
{
    public Guid CartId { get; private set; }
    public List<Guid> Products { get; private set; } = new List<Guid>();

    public void Apply(ProductAddedToCartEvent @event)
    {
        CartId = @event.CartId;
        Products.Add(@event.ProductId);
    }
}

public async Task<ShoppingCart> RebuildCartStateAsync(Guid cartId, IEventStore eventStore)
{
    var events = await eventStore.GetEventsAsync<ProductAddedToCartEvent>("cart-stream");
    var cart = new ShoppingCart();
    foreach (var @event in events)
    {
        cart.Apply(@event);
    }
    return cart;
}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing Event Sourcing, consider the following:

- **Event Versioning**: As the system evolves, events may need to change. Plan for versioning to handle changes gracefully.
- **Performance**: Storing and replaying events can be resource-intensive. Consider using snapshots to optimize performance.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that events are applied consistently across different parts of the system.
- **Security**: Protect sensitive data within events, especially when dealing with personal information.

### Differences and Similarities

Event Sourcing is often confused with Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). While they complement each other, they are distinct patterns:

- **Event Sourcing**: Focuses on storing state changes as events.
- **CQRS**: Separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

### Visualizing Event Sourcing

To better understand the flow of events in Event Sourcing, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Command
    participant Aggregate
    participant EventStore
    participant ReadModel

    User->>Command: Send Command
    Command->>Aggregate: Execute Command
    Aggregate->>EventStore: Store Event
    EventStore->>ReadModel: Update Read Model
    ReadModel->>User: Return Updated State
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of events in an Event Sourcing system. The user sends a command, which is executed by the aggregate. The resulting event is stored in the event store, and the read model is updated to reflect the new state.
