## 8.11 Fallback Pattern

In the world of microservices, where applications are composed of numerous independent services, ensuring resilience and reliability is paramount. The Fallback Pattern is a crucial design pattern that provides alternative responses or actions when a service fails. This pattern is essential for maintaining seamless user experiences and preventing cascading failures in distributed systems.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Fallback Pattern is to provide a mechanism to handle failures gracefully. When a service is unavailable or fails to respond, the Fallback Pattern allows the system to continue functioning by providing an alternative response or action. This ensures that users are not left with a broken application and that the system can recover from failures without significant disruption.

### Key Participants

- **Service Consumer**: The component or service that makes requests to another service.
- **Service Provider**: The service being consumed, which may fail or become unavailable.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: The logic that provides an alternative response or action when the service provider fails.

### Applicability

The Fallback Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- Services are prone to failures or downtimes.
- High availability and seamless user experiences are critical.
- There is a need to prevent cascading failures in a distributed system.
- Alternative responses or actions can be provided when a service fails.

### Implementing Fallback Strategies

Implementing fallback strategies in C# can be efficiently achieved using the Polly library. Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that provides policies for handling retries, circuit breakers, timeouts, and fallbacks.

#### Using Polly's Fallback Policies

Polly's fallback policies allow you to define alternative actions when a service call fails. Here's how you can implement a fallback strategy using Polly:

```csharp
using Polly;
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class FallbackExample
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Define a fallback policy
        var fallbackPolicy = Policy
            .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .FallbackAsync(async (cancellationToken) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Fallback action executed.");
                return new HttpResponseMessage(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
                {
                    Content = new StringContent("Fallback response")
                };
            });

        // Simulate a service call with fallback
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        var response = await fallbackPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Attempting to call service...");
            // Simulate a failing service call
            throw new HttpRequestException("Service is unavailable.");
        });

        Console.WriteLine($"Response: {await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()}");
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a fallback policy that handles `HttpRequestException`. When the service call fails, the fallback action is executed, providing a fallback response.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Fallback Pattern is widely used in various scenarios to handle service downtimes gracefully. Let's explore some common use cases and examples:

#### Handling Service Downtimes Gracefully

In a microservices architecture, services may become unavailable due to network issues, server failures, or maintenance. The Fallback Pattern allows you to handle these downtimes gracefully by providing alternative responses or actions.

For instance, consider an e-commerce application where the product recommendation service is temporarily unavailable. Instead of displaying an error message to the user, the application can use the Fallback Pattern to show a default set of popular products.

#### Providing Cached Responses

Another common use case for the Fallback Pattern is providing cached responses when a service fails. By caching responses from previous successful requests, you can ensure that users receive relevant data even when the service is unavailable.

Here's an example of using the Fallback Pattern with caching:

```csharp
using Polly;
using Polly.Caching;
using Polly.Caching.Memory;
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class FallbackWithCachingExample
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var memoryCacheProvider = new MemoryCacheProvider(new Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.MemoryCache(new Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.MemoryCacheOptions()));

        // Define a cache policy
        var cachePolicy = Policy.CacheAsync(memoryCacheProvider, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));

        // Define a fallback policy with caching
        var fallbackPolicy = Policy
            .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .FallbackAsync(async (cancellationToken) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Fallback action executed with cached response.");
                return new HttpResponseMessage(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
                {
                    Content = new StringContent("Cached response")
                };
            });

        // Combine cache and fallback policies
        var policyWrap = Policy.WrapAsync(fallbackPolicy, cachePolicy);

        // Simulate a service call with fallback and caching
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        var response = await policyWrap.ExecuteAsync(async (context) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Attempting to call service...");
            // Simulate a failing service call
            throw new HttpRequestException("Service is unavailable.");
        }, new Context("cacheKey"));

        Console.WriteLine($"Response: {await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()}");
    }
}
```

In this example, we use Polly's caching policy to store responses in memory. When the service call fails, the fallback action provides a cached response.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Fallback Pattern, consider the following design considerations:

- **Fallback Logic**: Ensure that the fallback logic provides meaningful and relevant responses to users. Avoid generic error messages that do not add value.
- **Performance**: Implement caching strategies to improve performance and reduce the load on fallback mechanisms.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test fallback scenarios to ensure that the system behaves as expected during failures.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and logging to track fallback occurrences and identify potential issues.

### Differences and Similarities

The Fallback Pattern is often compared to other resilience patterns, such as the Circuit Breaker Pattern. While both patterns aim to handle failures gracefully, they differ in their approaches:

- **Fallback Pattern**: Provides alternative responses or actions when a service fails.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents further calls to a failing service to allow it time to recover.

Both patterns can be used together to enhance resilience in microservices architectures.

### Visualizing the Fallback Pattern

To better understand the Fallback Pattern, let's visualize its workflow using a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Service
    participant Fallback

    Client->>Service: Request
    alt Service Available
        Service-->>Client: Response
    else Service Unavailable
        Service-->>Fallback: Trigger Fallback
        Fallback-->>Client: Fallback Response
    end
```

In this sequence diagram, the client makes a request to the service. If the service is available, it responds to the client. If the service is unavailable, the fallback mechanism is triggered, providing a fallback response to the client.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Fallback Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided:

- Experiment with different types of exceptions to trigger the fallback mechanism.
- Implement a more complex fallback logic that retrieves data from an alternative service.
- Integrate the Fallback Pattern with other resilience patterns, such as retries and circuit breakers.
