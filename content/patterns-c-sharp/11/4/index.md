## 11.4 Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that records state changes as a sequence of events. This approach allows us to reconstruct the state of a system at any point in time by replaying these events. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of Event Sourcing, explore its implementation in C#, and discuss its benefits, challenges, and use cases.

### Understanding Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern where every change to the state of an application is captured as an event. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only log. By replaying these events, we can reconstruct the state of the system at any given point in time.

#### Key Concepts

- **Event**: A record of a state change in the system. Events are immutable and represent facts that have occurred.
- **Event Store**: A storage mechanism for persisting events. It is typically append-only and optimized for writing.
- **Event Replay**: The process of rebuilding the current state of the system by replaying stored events.

### Implementing Event Sourcing in C#

Implementing Event Sourcing in C# involves recording all changes as events and storing them in an append-only log. Let's explore how to achieve this.

#### Recording All Changes as Events

To implement Event Sourcing, we need to define events that represent state changes in our system. Each event should capture the necessary information to describe the change.

```csharp
// Define an event interface
public interface IEvent
{
    DateTime Timestamp { get; }
}

// Implement a specific event
public class AccountCreatedEvent : IEvent
{
    public Guid AccountId { get; }
    public string AccountName { get; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; }

    public AccountCreatedEvent(Guid accountId, string accountName)
    {
        AccountId = accountId;
        AccountName = accountName;
        Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow;
    }
}
```

#### Storing Events in Append-Only Logs

Events are stored in an append-only log, ensuring that they are immutable and can be replayed to reconstruct the system state.

```csharp
// Event store interface
public interface IEventStore
{
    void SaveEvent(IEvent event);
    IEnumerable<IEvent> GetEvents(Guid aggregateId);
}

// In-memory event store implementation
public class InMemoryEventStore : IEventStore
{
    private readonly List<IEvent> _events = new List<IEvent>();

    public void SaveEvent(IEvent event)
    {
        _events.Add(event);
    }

    public IEnumerable<IEvent> GetEvents(Guid aggregateId)
    {
        return _events.Where(e => ((dynamic)e).AccountId == aggregateId);
    }
}
```

### Benefits and Challenges of Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing offers several benefits but also presents challenges that need to be addressed.

#### Benefits

- **Complete Audit Trails**: Every state change is recorded, providing a comprehensive audit trail.
- **Rebuild System State**: The system state can be rebuilt at any point by replaying events.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Facilitates an event-driven architecture, promoting decoupling and scalability.

#### Challenges

- **Complexity in Event Versioning**: Managing changes to event schemas over time can be complex.
- **Storage Requirements**: Storing all events can lead to significant storage requirements.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Systems using Event Sourcing may exhibit eventual consistency, which can complicate real-time processing.

### Use Cases and Examples

Event Sourcing is particularly useful in scenarios where a complete history of state changes is required or where complex business logic needs to be captured.

#### Domain-Driven Design

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event Sourcing can be used to capture domain events, providing a clear history of changes and enabling complex business logic to be modeled effectively.

```csharp
// Aggregate root with event sourcing
public class Account
{
    private readonly List<IEvent> _changes = new List<IEvent>();

    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public string Name { get; private set; }

    public Account(IEnumerable<IEvent> history)
    {
        foreach (var e in history) Apply(e);
    }

    public void CreateAccount(string name)
    {
        var @event = new AccountCreatedEvent(Guid.NewGuid(), name);
        Apply(@event);
        _changes.Add(@event);
    }

    private void Apply(IEvent @event)
    {
        switch (@event)
        {
            case AccountCreatedEvent e:
                Id = e.AccountId;
                Name = e.AccountName;
                break;
            // Handle other events
        }
    }

    public IEnumerable<IEvent> GetUncommittedChanges() => _changes;
}
```

#### Rebuilding System State from Events

By replaying events, we can rebuild the system state, which is particularly useful for recovering from failures or migrating data.

```csharp
// Rebuild account state from events
var eventStore = new InMemoryEventStore();
var events = eventStore.GetEvents(accountId);
var account = new Account(events);
```

### Visualizing Event Sourcing

To better understand Event Sourcing, let's visualize the process of recording and replaying events.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    participant EventStore

    User->>System: Perform Action
    System->>EventStore: Save Event
    EventStore-->>System: Acknowledge
    System-->>User: Action Completed

    User->>System: Request State
    System->>EventStore: Retrieve Events
    EventStore-->>System: Return Events
    System-->>User: Return Reconstructed State
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing Event Sourcing, consider the following:

- **Event Granularity**: Determine the level of detail captured by events.
- **Event Schema Evolution**: Plan for changes to event schemas over time.
- **Performance**: Optimize event storage and retrieval for performance.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

Event Sourcing is often compared with other patterns such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Change Data Capture (CDC). While CQRS separates read and write models, Event Sourcing focuses on capturing state changes as events. CDC, on the other hand, captures changes at the database level.
