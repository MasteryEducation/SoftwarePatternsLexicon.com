## 6.11 Iterator Design Pattern

The Iterator Design Pattern is a fundamental behavioral pattern that provides a standardized way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures, as it abstracts the traversal process, allowing developers to focus on the logic of iteration rather than the intricacies of the data structure itself.

### Iterator Pattern Description

The primary intent of the Iterator Design Pattern is to decouple the traversal logic from the collection's implementation. By doing so, it allows for flexibility and reusability of the iteration logic across different types of collections. This pattern is widely used in C# and is supported by the language's built-in interfaces, `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerable`.

### Key Participants

- **Iterator**: Defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements.
- **Concrete Iterator**: Implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal.
- **Aggregate**: Defines an interface for creating an Iterator object.
- **Concrete Aggregate**: Implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the Concrete Iterator.

### Implementing Iterator in C#

In C#, the Iterator pattern is implemented using the `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerable` interfaces. These interfaces provide a standard way to iterate over collections, such as arrays, lists, and custom data structures.

#### Using `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerable` Interfaces

The `IEnumerable` interface defines a single method, `GetEnumerator()`, which returns an `IEnumerator` object. The `IEnumerator` interface provides the methods `MoveNext()`, `Reset()`, and a property `Current` to facilitate iteration.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;

public class DaysOfWeek : IEnumerable
{
    private string[] days = { "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" };

    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator()
    {
        return new DaysEnumerator(days);
    }

    private class DaysEnumerator : IEnumerator
    {
        private string[] _days;
        private int position = -1;

        public DaysEnumerator(string[] days)
        {
            _days = days;
        }

        public bool MoveNext()
        {
            position++;
            return (position < _days.Length);
        }

        public void Reset()
        {
            position = -1;
        }

        public object Current
        {
            get
            {
                if (position < 0 || position >= _days.Length)
                    throw new InvalidOperationException();
                return _days[position];
            }
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        DaysOfWeek daysOfWeek = new DaysOfWeek();
        foreach (string day in daysOfWeek)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(day);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `DaysOfWeek` is a collection that implements `IEnumerable`, and `DaysEnumerator` is a nested class that implements `IEnumerator`. The `foreach` loop in the `Main` method demonstrates how the iterator is used to traverse the collection.

### Custom Iterators with Yield

C# provides a powerful feature called `yield` that simplifies the creation of iterators. By using `yield return`, you can create an iterator without explicitly implementing the `IEnumerator` interface.

#### Implementing Iterators Using `yield` Return

The `yield` keyword allows you to define an iterator block, which can return each element of the collection one at a time. This approach is more concise and easier to read.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class FibonacciSequence
{
    public IEnumerable<int> GetFibonacciNumbers(int count)
    {
        int previous = 0, current = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            yield return previous;
            int next = previous + current;
            previous = current;
            current = next;
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        FibonacciSequence fibonacci = new FibonacciSequence();
        foreach (int number in fibonacci.GetFibonacciNumbers(10))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(number);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `GetFibonacciNumbers` method uses `yield return` to generate Fibonacci numbers. The `foreach` loop in the `Main` method demonstrates how to iterate over the sequence.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Iterator pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:

- Loop over custom data structures without exposing their internal details.
- Provide multiple traversal algorithms for a collection.
- Simplify the iteration logic by using `yield`.

#### Looping Over Custom Data Structures

Consider a scenario where you have a custom data structure, such as a binary tree, and you want to iterate over its elements in a specific order (e.g., in-order traversal).

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class TreeNode<T>
{
    public T Value { get; set; }
    public TreeNode<T> Left { get; set; }
    public TreeNode<T> Right { get; set; }

    public TreeNode(T value)
    {
        Value = value;
        Left = Right = null;
    }
}

public class BinaryTree<T>
{
    public TreeNode<T> Root { get; set; }

    public IEnumerable<T> InOrderTraversal()
    {
        if (Root != null)
        {
            foreach (var value in InOrderTraversal(Root))
            {
                yield return value;
            }
        }
    }

    private IEnumerable<T> InOrderTraversal(TreeNode<T> node)
    {
        if (node.Left != null)
        {
            foreach (var value in InOrderTraversal(node.Left))
            {
                yield return value;
            }
        }

        yield return node.Value;

        if (node.Right != null)
        {
            foreach (var value in InOrderTraversal(node.Right))
            {
                yield return value;
            }
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BinaryTree<int> tree = new BinaryTree<int>
        {
            Root = new TreeNode<int>(1)
            {
                Left = new TreeNode<int>(2),
                Right = new TreeNode<int>(3)
            }
        };

        foreach (int value in tree.InOrderTraversal())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(value);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `BinaryTree` class provides an `InOrderTraversal` method that uses `yield` to iterate over the tree's nodes in in-order sequence.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Iterator pattern, consider the following:

- **Encapsulation**: The pattern helps maintain encapsulation by not exposing the internal structure of the collection.
- **Flexibility**: It allows for different traversal strategies without modifying the collection.
- **Performance**: Using `yield` can improve performance by generating elements on-the-fly, reducing memory usage.

### Differences and Similarities

The Iterator pattern is often compared to the **Composite** pattern, as both deal with collections. However, the Composite pattern focuses on treating individual objects and compositions uniformly, while the Iterator pattern focuses on traversing elements.

### Visualizing the Iterator Pattern

To better understand the Iterator pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the key participants using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Aggregate {
        +CreateIterator()
    }
    class ConcreteAggregate {
        +CreateIterator()
        -items : List
    }
    class Iterator {
        +First()
        +Next()
        +IsDone()
        +CurrentItem()
    }
    class ConcreteIterator {
        -current : int
        +First()
        +Next()
        +IsDone()
        +CurrentItem()
    }

    Aggregate <|-- ConcreteAggregate
    Iterator <|-- ConcreteIterator
    ConcreteAggregate --> ConcreteIterator : creates
    ConcreteIterator --> Aggregate : accesses
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the Aggregate, Concrete Aggregate, Iterator, and Concrete Iterator classes.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Iterator pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- Implement a custom iterator for a different data structure, such as a linked list.
- Experiment with different traversal strategies, such as pre-order or post-order traversal for the binary tree example.
- Use `yield` to create an iterator for a collection of objects with complex relationships.

### Knowledge Check

Before we conclude, let's reinforce what we've learned:

- Explain the purpose of the Iterator Design Pattern.
- Demonstrate how `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerable` are used in C#.
- Provide an example of using `yield` to simplify iterator implementation.
