## 10.10 Functional Programming in Practice

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the ability to adapt and integrate various programming paradigms is crucial. C#, traditionally known for its object-oriented capabilities, has embraced functional programming (FP) concepts, allowing developers to harness the power of both paradigms. In this section, we will delve into the practical application of functional programming in C#, exploring how to combine it with object-oriented programming (OOP) to create robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

### Combining Object-Oriented and Functional Paradigms

#### Finding the Balance Between Paradigms

Functional programming and object-oriented programming each have their strengths and weaknesses. OOP excels in modeling real-world entities and managing state, while FP shines in immutability, statelessness, and function composition. The key to mastering C# design patterns lies in finding a balance between these paradigms.

- **Immutability and State Management**: In OOP, objects often encapsulate state, which can lead to complex state management. FP encourages immutability, reducing side effects and making code easier to reason about. In C#, you can use `readonly` fields and immutable data structures to achieve this balance.

- **Encapsulation and Function Composition**: OOP's encapsulation allows for modular code, while FP's function composition promotes reusability. By combining these, you can create highly cohesive modules with reusable functions.

- **Polymorphism and Higher-Order Functions**: OOP uses polymorphism to achieve flexibility, whereas FP uses higher-order functions. C# supports both through interfaces and delegates, allowing you to choose the best tool for the job.

#### Utilizing the Best of Both Worlds

To effectively utilize both paradigms, consider the following strategies:

- **Use Classes for State and Functions for Behavior**: Encapsulate state within classes and define behavior using pure functions. This approach leverages OOP's strengths in state management and FP's strengths in behavior definition.

- **Leverage LINQ for Functional Operations**: LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful tool in C# that embodies functional programming principles. Use LINQ for data transformations, filtering, and aggregation.

- **Adopt Functional Patterns in OOP**: Implement functional patterns such as map, filter, and reduce within your OOP codebase. This can be achieved using extension methods and lambda expressions.

### Functional Libraries and Tools

#### Exploring Language Features and Extensions

C# has evolved to include numerous features that support functional programming. Let's explore some of these features:

- **Lambda Expressions**: These are anonymous functions that provide a concise way to represent small function expressions. They are essential for functional programming in C#.

  ```csharp
  Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;
  Console.WriteLine(square(5)); // Output: 25
  ```

- **Delegates and Events**: Delegates are type-safe function pointers, and events are built on top of delegates. They allow for functional-style callbacks and event handling.

  ```csharp
  public delegate void Notify(string message);
  public event Notify OnNotify;

  public void TriggerEvent()
  {
      OnNotify?.Invoke("Event triggered!");
  }
  ```

- **Pattern Matching**: Introduced in C# 7.0, pattern matching allows for more expressive and concise code, especially when dealing with complex data structures.

  ```csharp
  object obj = 42;
  if (obj is int number)
  {
      Console.WriteLine($"The number is {number}");
  }
  ```

- **Tuples and Records**: Tuples provide a lightweight way to group multiple values, while records (introduced in C# 9.0) offer a concise syntax for immutable data types.

  ```csharp
  var point = (X: 10, Y: 20);
  Console.WriteLine($"Point: {point.X}, {point.Y}");

  public record Person(string Name, int Age);
  var person = new Person("Alice", 30);
  ```

#### Using Third-Party Libraries like LanguageExt

LanguageExt is a popular library that brings functional programming constructs to C#. It provides features such as monads, functional data structures, and more.

- **Option and Either Types**: These types help handle nullability and errors without exceptions, promoting safer code.

  ```csharp
  Option<int> maybeNumber = Some(5);
  maybeNumber.Match(
      Some: x => Console.WriteLine($"Number: {x}"),
      None: () => Console.WriteLine("No number")
  );
  ```

- **Functional Collections**: LanguageExt offers immutable collections that support functional operations.

  ```csharp
  var numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4);
  var doubled = numbers.Map(x => x * 2);
  Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", doubled)); // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8
  ```

- **Monad Transformers**: These allow for the composition of monadic operations, simplifying complex workflows.

  ```csharp
  var result = from x in Some(5)
               from y in Some(10)
               select x + y;
  Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: Some(15)
  ```

### Practical Examples and Code Snippets

#### Example 1: Combining OOP and FP for a Shopping Cart

Let's create a simple shopping cart application that combines OOP and FP principles.

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public decimal Price { get; }

    public Product(string name, decimal price)
    {
        Name = name;
        Price = price;
    }
}

public class ShoppingCart
{
    private readonly List<Product> _products = new();

    public void AddProduct(Product product) => _products.Add(product);

    public decimal CalculateTotal() => _products.Sum(p => p.Price);
}

public static class ShoppingCartExtensions
{
    public static decimal ApplyDiscount(this ShoppingCart cart, Func<decimal, decimal> discountFunc)
    {
        var total = cart.CalculateTotal();
        return discountFunc(total);
    }
}

// Usage
var cart = new ShoppingCart();
cart.AddProduct(new Product("Book", 29.99m));
cart.AddProduct(new Product("Pen", 1.99m));

var totalWithDiscount = cart.ApplyDiscount(total => total * 0.9m);
Console.WriteLine($"Total with discount: {totalWithDiscount}");
```

In this example, we use OOP to model the `Product` and `ShoppingCart` classes, while leveraging FP through the `ApplyDiscount` extension method.

#### Example 2: Using LanguageExt for Safe Data Handling

Let's explore how LanguageExt can be used to handle data safely and functionally.

```csharp
using LanguageExt;
using static LanguageExt.Prelude;

public class UserService
{
    private readonly Dictionary<int, string> _users = new()
    {
        { 1, "Alice" },
        { 2, "Bob" }
    };

    public Option<string> GetUserById(int id) =>
        _users.ContainsKey(id) ? Some(_users[id]) : None;
}

// Usage
var userService = new UserService();
var user = userService.GetUserById(1);

user.Match(
    Some: name => Console.WriteLine($"User found: {name}"),
    None: () => Console.WriteLine("User not found")
);
```

In this example, we use the `Option` type from LanguageExt to safely handle the possibility of a missing user, avoiding null reference exceptions.

### Visualizing the Integration of OOP and FP

To better understand how OOP and FP can be integrated, let's visualize the flow of a simple application that uses both paradigms.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Create Product Class]
    B --> C[Create ShoppingCart Class]
    C --> D[Add Products to Cart]
    D --> E[Calculate Total]
    E --> F[Apply Discount Function]
    F --> G[Display Total]
    G --> H[End]
```

**Figure 1**: This flowchart illustrates the process of combining OOP and FP in a shopping cart application. We start by creating classes for products and the shopping cart, add products to the cart, calculate the total, apply a discount function, and finally display the total.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the examples provided:

- **Experiment with Different Discount Functions**: Modify the `ApplyDiscount` method to use different discount strategies, such as fixed discounts or tiered discounts based on the total amount.

- **Extend the UserService**: Add more methods to the `UserService` class, such as updating or deleting users, and handle these operations functionally using LanguageExt.

- **Visualize Your Own Application Flow**: Use Mermaid.js to create flowcharts for your own applications, illustrating how OOP and FP are integrated.
