## 20.1 Glossary of Terms

In this section, we provide a comprehensive glossary of key terms and concepts used throughout the "Mastering C# Design Patterns: Comprehensive Guide for Expert Software Engineers & Enterprise Architects." This glossary serves as a quick reference to help you understand the terminology and concepts essential for mastering C# design patterns and software architecture.

### A

**Abstract Factory Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is useful when a system must be independent of how its objects are created.

**Actor Model**  
A conceptual model used to deal with concurrent computation. In the actor model, "actors" are the universal primitives of concurrent computation. Akka.NET is a popular framework implementing this model in C#.

**Agile Software Development**  
A group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

**API Gateway Pattern**  
A microservices design pattern that acts as a single entry point for a set of microservices, handling requests by routing them to the appropriate service.

### B

**Backpressure**  
A mechanism in reactive programming to handle the situation where a data producer is generating data faster than a consumer can process it.

**Behavioral Design Patterns**  
Patterns that focus on communication between objects, defining how objects interact in a system. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

**Builder Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### C

**Chain of Responsibility Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
A pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store, optimizing for performance, scalability, and security.

**Creational Design Patterns**  
Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, and Prototype patterns.

**Currying**  
A functional programming technique where a function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.

### D

**Data Mapper Pattern**  
A structural pattern that separates the in-memory objects from the database, allowing for a clean separation of concerns and easier testing.

**Decorator Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

**Dependency Injection**  
A technique where an object receives other objects it depends on, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

### E

**Event Sourcing**  
A pattern where changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events, allowing for complete reconstruction of the state by replaying the events.

**Extension Methods**  
A feature in C# that allows developers to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type, using the `this` keyword.

### F

**Facade Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

**Factory Method Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Flyweight Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

### G

**Gang of Four (GoF)**  
Refers to the four authors of the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," which introduced 23 classic design patterns.

**GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)**  
A set of principles for assigning responsibilities to classes and objects in object-oriented design.

### H

**Hexagonal Architecture**  
An architectural pattern that aims to create loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment through ports and adapters.

**Higher-Order Functions**  
Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results, a key concept in functional programming.

### I

**Immutable Data Structures**  
Data structures that cannot be modified after they are created, promoting safer concurrent programming.

**Inversion of Control (IoC)**  
A design principle in which the control of object creation and management is transferred from the application code to a container or framework.

**Iterator Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### J

**Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)**  
A runtime compilation process that converts intermediate language code into machine code just before execution, improving performance.

### K

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**  
A design principle that emphasizes simplicity in design, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

### L

**Lazy Loading**  
A design pattern that delays the initialization of an object until it is needed, improving performance and resource utilization.

**LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**  
A set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language, allowing for querying of data in a type-safe manner.

### M

**Mediator Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.

**Microservices Architecture**  
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each implementing a business capability.

**Monostate Pattern**  
A design pattern where all instances of a class share the same state, often used as an alternative to the Singleton pattern.

### N

**Naked Objects Pattern**  
A design pattern where the user interface is automatically generated from the domain model, promoting a direct representation of the business logic.

**Null Object Pattern**  
A design pattern that uses a special object to represent the absence of an object, avoiding null references.

### O

**Observer Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, and notifies them of state changes.

**Object Pool Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use, rather than allocating and destroying them on demand.

### P

**Prototype Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that allows for the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

**Proxy Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Q

**Query Optimization**  
The process of improving the performance of a query by rewriting it or altering its execution plan.

### R

**Reactive Programming**  
A programming paradigm focused on data streams and the propagation of change, allowing for asynchronous data flow.

**Repository Pattern**  
A design pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.

### S

**Service Locator Pattern**  
A design pattern that provides a centralized registry for obtaining services, promoting loose coupling.

**Singleton Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**SOLID Principles**  
A set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### T

**Template Method Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

**Task Parallel Library (TPL)**  
A set of public types and APIs in the .NET Framework that support parallel programming, making it easier to write concurrent and parallel code.

### U

**Unit of Work Pattern**  
A design pattern that maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes.

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)**  
A standardized modeling language used to visualize the design of a system.

### V

**Visitor Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate, allowing for new operations to be added without modifying the objects.

### W

**Web API**  
An application programming interface for the web, allowing for interaction with web services.

**Wrapper Pattern**  
A design pattern that encapsulates an object to provide a new interface or behavior.

### Y

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**  
A principle of extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until it is necessary.

### Z

**Zero Downtime Deployment**  
A deployment strategy that ensures an application remains available during updates, minimizing disruption to users.
