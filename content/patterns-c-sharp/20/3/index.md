- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
    class Singleton {
      -Singleton instance
      -Singleton()
      +GetInstance() Singleton
    }
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Singleton
- **Applicability**: Use when exactly one instance of a class is needed to control access to shared resources.
- **Design Considerations**: Ensure thread safety in multi-threaded applications. Use `Lazy<T>` in C# for lazy initialization.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Often confused with the Factory Method, but Singleton focuses on instance control.

#### Factory Method Pattern

    class Product
    class ConcreteProduct
    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Product <|-- ConcreteProduct
  ```

    }
    class AndSpecification {
      +IsSatisfiedBy(Candidate)
    }
    class OrSpecification {
      +IsSatisfiedBy(Candidate)
    }
    Specification <|-- CompositeSpecification
    CompositeSpecification <|-- AndSpecification
    CompositeSpecification <|-- OrSpecification
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Specification
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to encapsulate business rules.
- **Design Considerations**: Promotes flexibility.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Different from Strategy as it focuses on rules.

#### Balking Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Prevent an object from executing an action if it is not in the appropriate state.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
    class Balking {
      +Request()
    }
  ```
- **Key Participants**: Balking
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to prevent actions in inappropriate states.
- **Design Considerations**: Promotes safety.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Different from State as it focuses on prevention.

#### Double Dispatch Pattern
- **Category**: Behavioral
- **Intent**: Resolve a method call to a method in a hierarchy based on the runtime types of two objects.
- **Structure Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
    class DoubleDispatch {
      +Dispatch()
    }
  ```
- **Key Participants**: DoubleDispatch
- **Applicability**: Use when you need to resolve method calls based on two types.
- **Design Considerations**: Promotes flexibility.
- **Differences and Similarities**: Different from Visitor as it focuses on dispatch.

## Quiz Time!

### What is the primary intent of the Singleton pattern?

- [x] Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- [ ] Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- [ ] Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- [ ] Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.

> **Explanation:** The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Which pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation?

- [ ] Adapter
- [x] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator

> **Explanation:** The Bridge pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### What is the key difference between the Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns?

- [x] Factory Method focuses on a single product, while Abstract Factory focuses on families of products.
- [ ] Factory Method is used for cloning objects, while Abstract Factory is used for creating objects.
- [ ] Factory Method is used for creating complex objects, while Abstract Factory is used for simple objects.
- [ ] Factory Method is used for managing object lifecycles, while Abstract Factory is used for managing object states.

> **Explanation:** The Factory Method pattern focuses on creating a single product, while the Abstract Factory pattern focuses on creating families of related or dependent products.

### Which pattern is best suited for adding responsibilities to individual objects dynamically?

- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Facade
- [x] Decorator
- [ ] Proxy

> **Explanation:** The Decorator pattern is best suited for adding responsibilities to individual objects dynamically without altering their structure.

### What is the primary purpose of the Observer pattern?

- [ ] Define a representation for a grammar and an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.
- [x] Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- [ ] Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- [ ] Capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

> **Explanation:** The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Which pattern is used to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem?

- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [x] Facade
- [ ] Proxy

> **Explanation:** The Facade pattern is used to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying the usage of complex systems.

### What is the primary intent of the Command pattern?

- [ ] Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- [ ] Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- [x] Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- [ ] Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

> **Explanation:** The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

### Which pattern is used to manage a pool of reusable objects to improve performance and resource utilization?

- [ ] Singleton
- [ ] Prototype
- [ ] Builder
- [x] Object Pool

> **Explanation:** The Object Pool pattern is used to manage a pool of reusable objects to improve performance and resource utilization.

### What is the primary purpose of the Strategy pattern?

- [x] Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- [ ] Capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
- [ ] Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- [ ] Define a representation for a grammar and an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.

> **Explanation:** The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### True or False: The Adapter pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> **Explanation:** False. The Adapter pattern is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, not to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object.
