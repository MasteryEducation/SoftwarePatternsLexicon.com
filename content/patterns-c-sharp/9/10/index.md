## 9.10 Double-Checked Locking Pattern

Concurrency is a critical aspect of modern software development, especially in a multi-threaded environment where resources are shared among different threads. The Double-Checked Locking Pattern is a widely used concurrency pattern that aims to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the "double-check") without actually acquiring the lock. This pattern is particularly useful in the context of lazy initialization of resources, such as the Singleton design pattern.

### Design Pattern Name

**Double-Checked Locking Pattern**

### Category

Concurrency Patterns

### Intent

The primary intent of the Double-Checked Locking Pattern is to minimize the performance cost associated with acquiring locks by first checking the locking condition without locking. This pattern is often used to ensure that a resource is initialized only once and is thread-safe, without incurring the overhead of locking every time the resource is accessed.

### Diagrams

To better understand the Double-Checked Locking Pattern, let's visualize its workflow using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Thread1
    participant Thread2
    participant Resource

    Thread1->>Resource: Check if initialized
    alt Not initialized
        Thread1->>Resource: Acquire lock
        alt Still not initialized
            Thread1->>Resource: Initialize resource
        end
        Thread1->>Resource: Release lock
    end
    Thread1->>Resource: Use resource

    Thread2->>Resource: Check if initialized
    alt Already initialized
        Thread2->>Resource: Use resource
    end
```

**Diagram Description:** This sequence diagram illustrates two threads attempting to access a shared resource. Thread1 checks if the resource is initialized, acquires a lock, and initializes it if necessary. Thread2 checks if the resource is initialized and uses it directly if it is.

### Key Participants

- **Resource:** The shared resource that needs to be initialized in a thread-safe manner.
- **Lock:** A synchronization mechanism used to ensure that only one thread can initialize the resource at a time.
- **Threads:** Multiple threads that attempt to access the shared resource.

### Applicability

The Double-Checked Locking Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You need to ensure that a resource is initialized only once.
- The resource initialization is costly, and you want to avoid unnecessary locking overhead.
- You are working in a multi-threaded environment where performance is a concern.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's explore a practical implementation of the Double-Checked Locking Pattern in C# using the Singleton design pattern as an example.

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            // First check without locking
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                lock (_lock)
                {
                    // Double-check with locking
                    if (_instance == null)
                    {
                        _instance = new Singleton();
                    }
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation:**

- **_instance:** A private static variable that holds the singleton instance.
- **_lock:** A private static readonly object used for locking.
- **Instance Property:** Provides access to the singleton instance. It first checks if the instance is null without locking. If it is null, it acquires a lock and performs a second check before initializing the instance.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Double-Checked Locking Pattern, consider the following:

- **Volatile Keyword:** In some languages, the `volatile` keyword is used to prevent compiler optimizations that could lead to incorrect behavior. In C#, the `volatile` keyword is not needed for reference types, but it is crucial to understand its role in other languages.
- **Memory Barriers:** Ensure that memory barriers are in place to prevent reordering of instructions, which can lead to incorrect initialization.
- **Performance:** While the pattern reduces locking overhead, it introduces complexity. Ensure that the performance benefits outweigh the added complexity.

### Differences and Similarities

The Double-Checked Locking Pattern is often confused with other synchronization patterns. Here are some key differences and similarities:

- **Singleton Pattern:** The Double-Checked Locking Pattern is commonly used in the Singleton pattern to ensure thread-safe lazy initialization.
- **Lazy Initialization:** Both patterns aim to delay the initialization of a resource until it is needed, but the Double-Checked Locking Pattern adds thread safety.
- **Locking Mechanisms:** Unlike simple locking mechanisms that acquire a lock every time, the Double-Checked Locking Pattern minimizes locking by performing an initial check without locking.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code by:

- Removing the lock and observing the behavior in a multi-threaded environment.
- Adding logging statements to track the initialization process.
- Modifying the code to use a different synchronization mechanism, such as `Monitor` or `Mutex`.

### Visualizing the Double-Checked Locking Pattern

Let's visualize the Double-Checked Locking Pattern using a flowchart to better understand its decision-making process.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is instance null?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Acquire lock]
    C --> D{Is instance still null?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Initialize instance]
    D -- No --> F[Release lock]
    E --> F[Release lock]
    B -- No --> G[Use instance]
    F --> G[Use instance]
    G --> H[End]
```

**Flowchart Description:** This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process of the Double-Checked Locking Pattern. It starts by checking if the instance is null, acquires a lock if necessary, performs a second check, initializes the instance if needed, and finally uses the instance.
