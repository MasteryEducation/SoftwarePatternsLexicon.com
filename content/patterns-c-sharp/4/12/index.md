## 4.12 Monostate Pattern

The Monostate Pattern is a unique approach within the realm of creational design patterns that allows multiple instances of a class to share the same state. Unlike the Singleton Pattern, which restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, the Monostate Pattern permits multiple instances while ensuring they all reflect the same state. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where global state management is required without the need to limit the number of instances.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Monostate Pattern is to ensure that all instances of a class share the same state. This is achieved by using static fields to hold the shared state, while allowing each instance to have its own identity. This pattern is beneficial in situations where you need to manage global state across multiple objects without enforcing a single instance constraint.

### Key Participants

- **Shared State**: The static fields that hold the state shared by all instances.
- **Instance Methods**: The methods that operate on the shared state, providing a way to interact with it through individual instances.

### Applicability

The Monostate Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You need to manage global state across multiple instances.
- You want to avoid the restrictions of the Singleton Pattern.
- You require a more flexible approach to shared state management.

### Implementing Monostate in C#

To implement the Monostate Pattern in C#, we use static fields to hold the shared state. Each instance of the class accesses these static fields, ensuring that all instances reflect the same state.

```csharp
public class Monostate
{
    private static int sharedValue;

    public int Value
    {
        get { return sharedValue; }
        set { sharedValue = value; }
    }
}

// Usage
Monostate instance1 = new Monostate();
Monostate instance2 = new Monostate();

instance1.Value = 42;
Console.WriteLine(instance2.Value); // Outputs: 42
```

In this example, the `sharedValue` field is static, meaning it is shared across all instances of the `Monostate` class. When `instance1` sets the `Value` property, `instance2` reflects this change, demonstrating the shared state.

### Diagrams

To better understand the Monostate Pattern, let's visualize the shared state concept using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Monostate {
        -static int sharedValue
        +int Value
    }
    Monostate : +int getValue()
    Monostate : +void setValue(int)
```

This diagram illustrates that the `sharedValue` is a static field, shared across all instances of the `Monostate` class.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### Managing Global Configuration

One common use case for the Monostate Pattern is managing global configuration settings. By using static fields to store configuration values, you can ensure that all parts of your application access the same configuration.

```csharp
public class Configuration
{
    private static string connectionString;

    public string ConnectionString
    {
        get { return connectionString; }
        set { connectionString = value; }
    }
}

// Usage
Configuration config1 = new Configuration();
Configuration config2 = new Configuration();

config1.ConnectionString = "Server=myServer;Database=myDB;";
Console.WriteLine(config2.ConnectionString); // Outputs: Server=myServer;Database=myDB;
```

In this example, the `Configuration` class uses the Monostate Pattern to manage a shared connection string across multiple instances.

#### Logging

Another practical application of the Monostate Pattern is in logging. By using a shared state for log settings, you can ensure consistent logging behavior across different parts of your application.

```csharp
public class Logger
{
    private static string logLevel;

    public string LogLevel
    {
        get { return logLevel; }
        set { logLevel = value; }
    }

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[{logLevel}] {message}");
    }
}

// Usage
Logger logger1 = new Logger();
Logger logger2 = new Logger();

logger1.LogLevel = "INFO";
logger2.Log("This is a log message."); // Outputs: [INFO] This is a log message.
```

Here, the `Logger` class uses the Monostate Pattern to maintain a shared log level across multiple logger instances.

### Design Considerations

When using the Monostate Pattern, consider the following:

- **Thread Safety**: Since the shared state is static, you need to ensure thread safety when accessing or modifying it. Use synchronization mechanisms like locks to prevent race conditions.
- **Testing**: Testing classes that use the Monostate Pattern can be challenging due to the shared state. Consider using dependency injection or mock objects to isolate tests.
- **Performance**: Accessing static fields can have performance implications, especially in high-concurrency scenarios. Profile your application to ensure acceptable performance.

### Differences and Similarities

The Monostate Pattern is often compared to the Singleton Pattern. While both patterns manage shared state, they differ in their approach:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Restricts instantiation to a single object, ensuring a single point of access to the shared state.
- **Monostate Pattern**: Allows multiple instances, each reflecting the shared state, providing more flexibility in object creation.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Monostate Pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- Add additional properties to the `Monostate` class and observe how they share state across instances.
- Implement thread safety in the `Logger` example using locks.
- Create a new use case where the Monostate Pattern can be applied, such as managing user preferences.

### Visualizing Shared State

To further illustrate the concept of shared state in the Monostate Pattern, consider the following sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Instance1 as Monostate Instance 1
    participant Instance2 as Monostate Instance 2
    participant SharedState as Shared State

    Instance1->>SharedState: Set Value to 42
    Instance2->>SharedState: Get Value
    SharedState-->>Instance2: Return 42
```

This diagram shows how two instances of the `Monostate` class interact with the shared state, demonstrating the pattern's behavior.
