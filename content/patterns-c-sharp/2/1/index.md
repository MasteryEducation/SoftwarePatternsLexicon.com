## 2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several core principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles help in creating modular, reusable, and scalable code. In this section, we will delve into these fundamental concepts and demonstrate how they are implemented in C#.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. Encapsulation is a means of restricting access to certain components and is a fundamental aspect of OOP.

#### Key Concepts of Encapsulation

- **Access Modifiers**: C# provides several access modifiers, such as `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `internal`, to control the visibility of class members.
- **Properties**: Properties in C# are a way to encapsulate fields and provide controlled access to them.

#### Example of Encapsulation in C#

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Private field

    // Public property with a private setter
    public decimal Balance
    {
        get { return balance; }
        private set { balance = value; }
    }

    public BankAccount(decimal initialBalance)
    {
        Balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            Balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public bool Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= Balance)
        {
            Balance -= amount;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the `balance` field, providing controlled access through the `Balance` property and methods like `Deposit` and `Withdraw`.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the `BankAccount` class by adding methods to transfer funds between accounts or to calculate interest. Observe how encapsulation helps maintain the integrity of the balance data.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

#### Key Concepts of Inheritance

- **Base Class**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited.
- **Derived Class**: The class that inherits from the base class.
- **`virtual` and `override` Keywords**: Used to modify methods in the base class and override them in the derived class.

#### Example of Inheritance in C#

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The cat meows.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class and override the `Speak` method to provide specific behavior.

#### Try It Yourself

Create additional animal classes, such as `Bird` or `Fish`, and override the `Speak` method to reflect their unique sounds. Notice how inheritance simplifies the addition of new animal types.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

#### Key Concepts of Polymorphism

- **Method Overriding**: Allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.
- **Interfaces**: Define a contract that implementing classes must adhere to, enabling polymorphic behavior.

#### Example of Polymorphism in C#

```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    double Area();
}

public class Circle : IShape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle : IShape
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public double Area()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}

public class ShapePrinter
{
    public void PrintArea(IShape shape)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The area is {shape.Area()}");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Circle` and `Rectangle` implement the `IShape` interface, allowing `ShapePrinter` to interact with any shape polymorphically.

#### Try It Yourself

Implement additional shapes, such as `Triangle` or `Square`, and use the `ShapePrinter` class to print their areas. Observe how polymorphism allows for flexible and reusable code.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

#### Key Concepts of Abstraction

- **Abstract Classes**: Cannot be instantiated and are used to define a template for derived classes.
- **Abstract Methods**: Must be implemented by non-abstract derived classes.

#### Example of Abstraction in C#

```csharp
public abstract class Vehicle
{
    public abstract void Start();

    public void Stop()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The vehicle stops.");
    }
}

public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The car starts with a key.");
    }
}

public class Motorcycle : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The motorcycle starts with a button.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Vehicle` is an abstract class with an abstract method `Start`, which must be implemented by derived classes like `Car` and `Motorcycle`.

#### Try It Yourself

Create additional vehicle types, such as `Truck` or `Bicycle`, and implement the `Start` method. Notice how abstraction allows you to define a common interface for different vehicle types.

### Visualizing OOP Concepts

To better understand the relationships between classes and objects in OOP, let's visualize these concepts using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +string Name
        +void Speak()
    }
    class Dog {
        +void Speak()
    }
    class Cat {
        +void Speak()
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```

This diagram illustrates the inheritance relationship between the `Animal` class and its derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`.
