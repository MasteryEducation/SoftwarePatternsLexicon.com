## 3.15 Extension Object Pattern

The Extension Object Pattern is a powerful design pattern that allows developers to dynamically add new functionality to objects without altering their structure. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the system needs to be flexible and adaptable, such as in plugin systems and feature toggles. In this section, we will explore the intricacies of the Extension Object Pattern, its implementation in C#, and its practical applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Extension Object Pattern is to provide a mechanism for extending the capabilities of an object dynamically. This is achieved by attaching new extension objects to the original object, thereby enhancing its functionality without modifying its core structure. This pattern is ideal for systems that require a high degree of flexibility and modularity.

### Key Participants

1. **Component Interface**: Defines the interface for the objects that can have extensions.
2. **Concrete Component**: The class that implements the component interface and can have extensions attached.
3. **Extension Interface**: Defines the interface for the extension objects.
4. **Concrete Extension**: Implements the extension interface and provides additional functionality.
5. **Extension Manager**: Manages the extensions and facilitates their interaction with the component.

### Applicability

The Extension Object Pattern is applicable in the following scenarios:

- **Plugin Systems**: When you need to add new features or capabilities to an application without altering its core codebase.
- **Feature Toggles**: When you want to enable or disable features dynamically based on certain conditions or configurations.
- **Modular Applications**: When building applications that require a high degree of modularity and flexibility.

### Sample Code Snippet

Let's delve into a practical example to illustrate the Extension Object Pattern in C#. We'll create a simple application that allows adding extensions to a `Document` object.

```csharp
// Component Interface
public interface IDocument
{
    void Display();
}

// Concrete Component
public class Document : IDocument
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Displaying the document.");
    }
}

// Extension Interface
public interface IDocumentExtension
{
    void Extend(IDocument document);
}

// Concrete Extension
public class SpellCheckExtension : IDocumentExtension
{
    public void Extend(IDocument document)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Spell checking the document.");
    }
}

// Extension Manager
public class DocumentExtensionManager
{
    private readonly List<IDocumentExtension> _extensions = new List<IDocumentExtension>();

    public void AddExtension(IDocumentExtension extension)
    {
        _extensions.Add(extension);
    }

    public void ApplyExtensions(IDocument document)
    {
        foreach (var extension in _extensions)
        {
            extension.Extend(document);
        }
    }
}

// Usage
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        IDocument document = new Document();
        DocumentExtensionManager extensionManager = new DocumentExtensionManager();

        // Add extensions
        extensionManager.AddExtension(new SpellCheckExtension());

        // Display document
        document.Display();

        // Apply extensions
        extensionManager.ApplyExtensions(document);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Document` class that implements the `IDocument` interface. We can extend its functionality by adding extensions like `SpellCheckExtension` using the `DocumentExtensionManager`.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Extension Object Pattern, consider the following:

- **Decoupling**: Ensure that the extensions are decoupled from the core component to maintain modularity.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of adding multiple extensions, as each extension may introduce additional processing overhead.
- **Scalability**: Design the extension manager to handle a large number of extensions efficiently.

### Differences and Similarities

The Extension Object Pattern is often compared to the Decorator Pattern. While both patterns allow adding functionality to objects, the key difference lies in their approach. The Decorator Pattern wraps the original object, whereas the Extension Object Pattern attaches new objects to the original object.

### Visualizing the Extension Object Pattern

To better understand the Extension Object Pattern, let's visualize its structure using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    IDocument <|-- Document
    IDocumentExtension <|-- SpellCheckExtension
    IDocumentExtension <|-- AnotherExtension
    class IDocument {
        +void Display()
    }
    class Document {
        +void Display()
    }
    class IDocumentExtension {
        +void Extend(IDocument document)
    }
    class SpellCheckExtension {
        +void Extend(IDocument document)
    }
    class AnotherExtension {
        +void Extend(IDocument document)
    }
    class DocumentExtensionManager {
        +void AddExtension(IDocumentExtension extension)
        +void ApplyExtensions(IDocument document)
    }
    DocumentExtensionManager --> IDocumentExtension
```

This diagram illustrates the relationships between the component, extensions, and the extension manager.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Extension Object Pattern, try modifying the code example to add a new extension, such as a `GrammarCheckExtension`. Experiment with different combinations of extensions and observe how they interact with the `Document` object.

### Use Cases in Plugin Systems and Feature Toggles

#### Plugin Systems

In a plugin system, the Extension Object Pattern allows developers to add new plugins without altering the core application. Each plugin can be implemented as an extension object, providing additional functionality to the application.

#### Feature Toggles

Feature toggles enable or disable features dynamically based on configurations. By implementing features as extension objects, you can easily toggle them on or off without modifying the core application logic.
