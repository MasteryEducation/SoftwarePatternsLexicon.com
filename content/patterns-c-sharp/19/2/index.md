### Try It Yourself: Experiment with Code

To truly master design patterns, it's essential to practice and experiment with code. Here are some exercises and challenges to help you apply what you've learned:

1. **Implement a Singleton Pattern**
   - Create a simple logging system using the Singleton pattern. Ensure that only one instance of the logger is created and used throughout the application.

2. **Build a Factory Method Pattern**
   - Develop a shape creation system using the Factory Method pattern. Allow users to create different shapes (e.g., circle, square, triangle) without specifying the exact class of the object.

3. **Apply the Observer Pattern**
   - Implement a weather monitoring system using the Observer pattern. Allow multiple observers to receive updates when the weather changes.

4. **Experiment with the Strategy Pattern**
   - Create a payment processing system using the Strategy pattern. Allow users to choose different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) at runtime.

### Visualizing Design Patterns

To enhance your understanding of design patterns, it's helpful to visualize their structure and interactions. Below are some diagrams created using Mermaid.js to illustrate common design patterns.

#### Singleton Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -instance : Singleton
        +getInstance() : Singleton
    }
    Singleton : -Singleton()
    Singleton : +getInstance() : Singleton
```

*Description:* The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

#### Factory Method Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Creator {
        +factoryMethod() : Product
    }
    class ConcreteCreator {
        +factoryMethod() : ConcreteProduct
    }
    class Product
    class ConcreteProduct

    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Creator o-- Product
    ConcreteCreator o-- ConcreteProduct
```

*Description:* The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

#### Observer Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        +attach(Observer)
        +detach(Observer)
        +notify()
    }
    class ConcreteSubject {
        -state : int
        +getState() : int
        +setState(int)
    }
    class Observer {
        +update()
    }
    class ConcreteObserver {
        -subject : ConcreteSubject
        +update()
    }

    Subject <|-- ConcreteSubject
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver
    ConcreteSubject o-- Observer
```

*Description:* The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
