## 12.2 Messaging Patterns

In the realm of enterprise integration, messaging patterns play a crucial role in enabling seamless communication between disparate systems. These patterns provide a structured approach to handling data exchange, ensuring that messages are processed efficiently and effectively. In this section, we will delve into four key messaging patterns: Pipes and Filters, Message Router, Message Transformation, and Intercepting Filter. Each pattern offers unique advantages and can be applied to solve specific integration challenges.

### Pipes and Filters Pattern

#### Intent
The Pipes and Filters pattern is designed to process data through a series of independent processing steps, known as filters, connected by channels, known as pipes. This pattern promotes modularity and reusability by allowing each filter to perform a specific function.

#### Key Participants
- **Filter**: A processing component that performs a specific operation on the data.
- **Pipe**: A conduit that transfers data from one filter to another.

#### Applicability
Use the Pipes and Filters pattern when you need to:
- Process data in a series of independent steps.
- Build modular and reusable components.
- Easily add, remove, or reorder processing steps.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```csharp
// Define a simple filter interface
public interface IFilter
{
    string Process(string input);
}

// Implement a concrete filter
public class UpperCaseFilter : IFilter
{
    public string Process(string input)
    {
        return input.ToUpper();
    }
}

// Implement another concrete filter
public class ReverseStringFilter : IFilter
{
    public string Process(string input)
    {
        char[] charArray = input.ToCharArray();
        Array.Reverse(charArray);
        return new string(charArray);
    }
}

// Pipe class to connect filters
public class Pipe
{
    private readonly List<IFilter> _filters = new List<IFilter>();

    public void AddFilter(IFilter filter)
    {
        _filters.Add(filter);
    }

    public string Process(string input)
    {
        string result = input;
        foreach (var filter in _filters)
        {
            result = filter.Process(result);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

// Usage
var pipe = new Pipe();
pipe.AddFilter(new UpperCaseFilter());
pipe.AddFilter(new ReverseStringFilter());

string input = "Hello World";
string output = pipe.Process(input);
Console.WriteLine(output); // Output: "DLROW OLLEH"
```

#### Design Considerations
- **Scalability**: Easily scale by adding more filters.
- **Flexibility**: Reorder or replace filters without affecting the overall system.
- **Performance**: Consider the overhead of passing data through multiple filters.

#### Visualizing the Pipes and Filters Pattern

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Data] --> B[Filter 1];
    B --> C[Filter 2];
    C --> D[Filter 3];
    D --> E[Output Data];
```

### Message Router Patterns

#### Intent
Message Router patterns are used to direct messages to different destinations based on their content or other attributes. This pattern is essential for dynamic routing in complex systems.

#### Key Participants
- **Message**: The data being routed.
- **Router**: The component responsible for determining the message's destination.

#### Applicability
Use the Message Router pattern when you need to:
- Route messages dynamically based on content.
- Implement content-based routing.
- Decouple message producers from consumers.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```csharp
// Define a simple message class
public class Message
{
    public string Content { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; }
}

// Define a router interface
public interface IMessageRouter
{
    void RouteMessage(Message message);
}

// Implement a content-based router
public class ContentBasedRouter : IMessageRouter
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, Action<Message>> _routes = new Dictionary<string, Action<Message>>();

    public void AddRoute(string messageType, Action<Message> action)
    {
        _routes[messageType] = action;
    }

    public void RouteMessage(Message message)
    {
        if (_routes.ContainsKey(message.Type))
        {
            _routes[message.Type](message);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("No route found for message type: " + message.Type);
        }
    }
}

// Usage
var router = new ContentBasedRouter();
router.AddRoute("Text", msg => Console.WriteLine("Text message: " + msg.Content));
router.AddRoute("Email", msg => Console.WriteLine("Email message: " + msg.Content));

var textMessage = new Message { Content = "Hello", Type = "Text" };
var emailMessage = new Message { Content = "Hello via Email", Type = "Email" };

router.RouteMessage(textMessage); // Output: "Text message: Hello"
router.RouteMessage(emailMessage); // Output: "Email message: Hello via Email"
```

#### Design Considerations
- **Flexibility**: Easily add new routes without modifying existing code.
- **Decoupling**: Producers and consumers are decoupled, promoting loose coupling.
- **Complexity**: Ensure routing logic remains manageable as the number of routes increases.

#### Visualizing the Message Router Pattern

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Incoming Message] -->|Type: Text| B[Text Handler];
    A -->|Type: Email| C[Email Handler];
    A -->|Type: Unknown| D[Default Handler];
```

### Message Transformation Patterns

#### Intent
Message Transformation patterns are used to convert messages from one format to another, ensuring compatibility between different systems or components.

#### Key Participants
- **Message**: The data being transformed.
- **Transformer**: The component responsible for converting the message.

#### Applicability
Use the Message Transformation pattern when you need to:
- Translate messages between different formats.
- Ensure compatibility between disparate systems.
- Use adapters and transformers to facilitate communication.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```csharp
// Define a simple message class
public class XmlMessage
{
    public string XmlContent { get; set; }
}

// Define a transformer interface
public interface IMessageTransformer
{
    string Transform(XmlMessage message);
}

// Implement a JSON transformer
public class JsonTransformer : IMessageTransformer
{
    public string Transform(XmlMessage message)
    {
        // Simulate XML to JSON transformation
        return "{ \"content\": \"" + message.XmlContent + "\" }";
    }
}

// Usage
var xmlMessage = new XmlMessage { XmlContent = "<content>Hello</content>" };
var transformer = new JsonTransformer();

string jsonMessage = transformer.Transform(xmlMessage);
Console.WriteLine(jsonMessage); // Output: { "content": "<content>Hello</content>" }
```

#### Design Considerations
- **Compatibility**: Ensure transformed messages are compatible with target systems.
- **Performance**: Consider the overhead of transformation processes.
- **Maintainability**: Keep transformation logic simple and maintainable.

#### Visualizing the Message Transformation Pattern

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[XML Message] --> B[Transformer];
    B --> C[JSON Message];
```

### Intercepting Filter Pattern

#### Intent
The Intercepting Filter pattern is used to preprocess requests before they reach the target handler. This pattern is useful for building filter pipelines with middleware.

#### Key Participants
- **Filter**: A component that processes requests.
- **Target**: The final handler of the request.

#### Applicability
Use the Intercepting Filter pattern when you need to:
- Preprocess requests before handling.
- Build filter pipelines with middleware.
- Apply cross-cutting concerns like logging or authentication.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```csharp
// Define a filter interface
public interface IRequestFilter
{
    void Execute(HttpRequest request);
}

// Implement a logging filter
public class LoggingFilter : IRequestFilter
{
    public void Execute(HttpRequest request)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Logging request: " + request.Url);
    }
}

// Implement an authentication filter
public class AuthenticationFilter : IRequestFilter
{
    public void Execute(HttpRequest request)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Authenticating request: " + request.Url);
    }
}

// Define a target handler
public class TargetHandler
{
    public void Handle(HttpRequest request)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Handling request: " + request.Url);
    }
}

// Define a filter chain
public class FilterChain
{
    private readonly List<IRequestFilter> _filters = new List<IRequestFilter>();
    private readonly TargetHandler _targetHandler;

    public FilterChain(TargetHandler targetHandler)
    {
        _targetHandler = targetHandler;
    }

    public void AddFilter(IRequestFilter filter)
    {
        _filters.Add(filter);
    }

    public void Execute(HttpRequest request)
    {
        foreach (var filter in _filters)
        {
            filter.Execute(request);
        }
        _targetHandler.Handle(request);
    }
}

// Usage
var targetHandler = new TargetHandler();
var filterChain = new FilterChain(targetHandler);
filterChain.AddFilter(new LoggingFilter());
filterChain.AddFilter(new AuthenticationFilter());

var request = new HttpRequest { Url = "http://example.com" };
filterChain.Execute(request);
// Output:
// Logging request: http://example.com
// Authenticating request: http://example.com
// Handling request: http://example.com
```

#### Design Considerations
- **Modularity**: Easily add or remove filters without affecting the target handler.
- **Reusability**: Reuse filters across different requests or applications.
- **Performance**: Consider the overhead of executing multiple filters.

#### Visualizing the Intercepting Filter Pattern

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Incoming Request] --> B[Filter 1];
    B --> C[Filter 2];
    C --> D[Target Handler];
```
