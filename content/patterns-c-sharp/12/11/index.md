## 12.11 Business Delegate Pattern

In the realm of enterprise software development, the Business Delegate Pattern plays a crucial role in separating business logic from the presentation tier. This pattern introduces a delegate that acts as an intermediary, managing communication with business services. By doing so, it simplifies the interaction between the presentation layer and the business logic, promoting a cleaner and more maintainable architecture.

### Design Pattern Name

**Business Delegate Pattern**

### Category

Enterprise Integration Patterns

### Intent

The primary intent of the Business Delegate Pattern is to decouple the presentation layer from the business logic layer by introducing a delegate that handles all communication with business services. This separation allows for a more modular and maintainable architecture, where changes in the business logic do not directly impact the presentation layer.

### Key Participants

- **Business Delegate**: Acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the business services. It abstracts the complexity of service interactions.
- **Business Service**: Represents the actual business logic or service that performs operations.
- **Client**: The presentation layer or any component that requires access to business services.

### Applicability

The Business Delegate Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- There is a need to separate concerns between the presentation and business logic layers.
- The application architecture is layered, and communication between layers needs to be streamlined.
- There is a need to reduce coupling between the presentation layer and business services.
- You want to centralize error handling and service lookup logic.

### Implementing Business Delegate in C#

Let's delve into how we can implement the Business Delegate Pattern in C#. We'll create delegate classes to manage service interactions, providing a clear separation between the presentation and business logic layers.

#### Step 1: Define the Business Service Interface

First, define an interface for the business service. This interface will declare the operations that the business service provides.

```csharp
public interface IBusinessService
{
    void PerformOperation();
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Business Service

Next, implement the business service interface. This class contains the actual business logic.

```csharp
public class BusinessService : IBusinessService
{
    public void PerformOperation()
    {
        // Business logic implementation
        Console.WriteLine("Performing business operation...");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Business Delegate

The business delegate acts as an intermediary between the client and the business service. It handles service lookup and delegates calls to the business service.

```csharp
public class BusinessDelegate
{
    private IBusinessService _businessService;

    public BusinessDelegate()
    {
        // Service lookup or initialization
        _businessService = new BusinessService();
    }

    public void Execute()
    {
        // Delegate the call to the business service
        _businessService.PerformOperation();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement the Client

The client interacts with the business delegate instead of directly communicating with the business service.

```csharp
public class Client
{
    private BusinessDelegate _businessDelegate;

    public Client(BusinessDelegate businessDelegate)
    {
        _businessDelegate = businessDelegate;
    }

    public void DoTask()
    {
        // Use the business delegate to perform the operation
        _businessDelegate.Execute();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Test the Implementation

Finally, test the implementation to ensure that the client can perform operations through the business delegate.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        BusinessDelegate businessDelegate = new BusinessDelegate();
        Client client = new Client(businessDelegate);

        client.DoTask();
    }
}
```

### Diagrams

To better understand the flow of the Business Delegate Pattern, let's visualize it using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant BusinessDelegate
    participant BusinessService

    Client->>BusinessDelegate: Execute()
    BusinessDelegate->>BusinessService: PerformOperation()
    BusinessService-->>BusinessDelegate: Operation Result
    BusinessDelegate-->>Client: Result
```

**Diagram Description:** This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the client, business delegate, and business service. The client requests an operation through the business delegate, which then delegates the request to the business service. The result is returned back to the client through the business delegate.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Business Delegate Pattern is particularly useful in enterprise applications with layered architectures. Let's explore some use cases and examples where this pattern can be effectively applied.

#### Use Case 1: Simplifying Communication in Layered Architectures

In a typical enterprise application, the presentation layer often needs to interact with multiple business services. Direct communication between these layers can lead to tight coupling and increased complexity. By introducing a business delegate, we can centralize service interactions, making the architecture more modular and easier to maintain.

#### Example: E-commerce Application

Consider an e-commerce application where the presentation layer needs to interact with various business services, such as order processing, inventory management, and payment processing. By using the Business Delegate Pattern, we can create a delegate for each service, simplifying communication and reducing dependencies.

```csharp
public class OrderBusinessDelegate
{
    private IOrderService _orderService;

    public OrderBusinessDelegate()
    {
        _orderService = new OrderService();
    }

    public void PlaceOrder(Order order)
    {
        _orderService.ProcessOrder(order);
    }
}

public interface IOrderService
{
    void ProcessOrder(Order order);
}

public class OrderService : IOrderService
{
    public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
    {
        // Order processing logic
        Console.WriteLine("Order processed.");
    }
}

public class Order
{
    // Order properties
}
```

In this example, the `OrderBusinessDelegate` acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the `OrderService`. The presentation layer interacts with the `OrderBusinessDelegate` to place orders, while the delegate handles communication with the `OrderService`.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Business Delegate Pattern, consider the following:

- **Service Lookup**: The business delegate is responsible for service lookup and initialization. Ensure that this process is efficient and does not introduce unnecessary overhead.
- **Error Handling**: Centralize error handling within the business delegate to provide a consistent error management strategy across the application.
- **Performance**: While the business delegate simplifies communication, it may introduce additional layers of abstraction. Ensure that this does not negatively impact performance.
- **Scalability**: The pattern should support scalability by allowing easy addition of new business services without affecting the presentation layer.

### Differences and Similarities

The Business Delegate Pattern is often compared to other patterns, such as the **Facade Pattern** and **Service Locator Pattern**. Let's explore the differences and similarities:

- **Facade Pattern**: Both patterns provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. However, the Business Delegate Pattern specifically focuses on decoupling the presentation layer from business services, while the Facade Pattern is more general-purpose.
- **Service Locator Pattern**: The Service Locator Pattern is used for service lookup and retrieval, similar to the business delegate's role. However, the Business Delegate Pattern also includes delegation of service calls, providing a higher level of abstraction.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Business Delegate Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- **Add New Services**: Implement additional business services and create corresponding delegates. Test how the presentation layer interacts with these new services through the delegates.
- **Enhance Error Handling**: Introduce error handling logic within the business delegate to manage exceptions thrown by business services.
- **Optimize Service Lookup**: Experiment with different service lookup strategies, such as caching or lazy initialization, to improve performance.
