## 12.14 Data Mapper Pattern

In the realm of enterprise software development, managing the interaction between in-memory objects and database records is a critical task. The Data Mapper Pattern is a design pattern that facilitates this interaction by transferring data between objects and a database while keeping them independent. This pattern is particularly useful in decoupling the persistence layer from the domain logic, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Data Mapper Pattern is to separate the in-memory representation of data from the database schema. This separation allows developers to focus on the business logic without worrying about the underlying database structure. By using a Data Mapper, you can achieve a clean separation of concerns, making your codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

### Key Participants

1. **Domain Objects**: These are the objects that represent the business logic and data in your application. They are independent of the database schema.

2. **Data Mapper**: This component is responsible for transferring data between the domain objects and the database. It encapsulates the logic for converting between the two representations.

3. **Database**: The storage system where the data is persisted. The Data Mapper interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Applicability

The Data Mapper Pattern is applicable in scenarios where:

- You need to decouple the domain logic from the persistence logic.
- The database schema is complex and subject to change.
- You want to support multiple data sources or databases.
- You need to implement a persistence layer that is independent of the domain model.

### Implementing Data Mapper in C#

To implement the Data Mapper Pattern in C#, you need to create mapper classes that handle the conversion between domain objects and database records. Let's walk through the steps involved in implementing a Data Mapper.

#### Step 1: Define Domain Objects

Start by defining the domain objects that represent the business logic in your application. These objects should be independent of the database schema.

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Data Mapper Interface

Define an interface for the Data Mapper that specifies the operations for transferring data between the domain objects and the database.

```csharp
public interface ICustomerMapper
{
    Customer FindById(int id);
    void Insert(Customer customer);
    void Update(Customer customer);
    void Delete(int id);
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Data Mapper

Implement the Data Mapper interface to handle the conversion between domain objects and database records. This implementation will interact with the database to perform CRUD operations.

```csharp
public class CustomerMapper : ICustomerMapper
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;

    public CustomerMapper(string connectionString)
    {
        _connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public Customer FindById(int id)
    {
        // Database interaction logic to find a customer by ID
        // For demonstration, let's assume we're using ADO.NET
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Id = @Id", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", id);

            using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
            {
                if (reader.Read())
                {
                    return new Customer
                    {
                        Id = (int)reader["Id"],
                        Name = (string)reader["Name"],
                        Email = (string)reader["Email"]
                    };
                }
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public void Insert(Customer customer)
    {
        // Database interaction logic to insert a new customer
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO Customers (Name, Email) VALUES (@Name, @Email)", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Name", customer.Name);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Email", customer.Email);
            command.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
    }

    public void Update(Customer customer)
    {
        // Database interaction logic to update an existing customer
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("UPDATE Customers SET Name = @Name, Email = @Email WHERE Id = @Id", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Name", customer.Name);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Email", customer.Email);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", customer.Id);
            command.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
    }

    public void Delete(int id)
    {
        // Database interaction logic to delete a customer
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("DELETE FROM Customers WHERE Id = @Id", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", id);
            command.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

### Diagrams

To better understand the Data Mapper Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the domain objects, the Data Mapper, and the database.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Customer {
        +int Id
        +string Name
        +string Email
    }

    class ICustomerMapper {
        +Customer FindById(int id)
        +void Insert(Customer customer)
        +void Update(Customer customer)
        +void Delete(int id)
    }

    class CustomerMapper {
        -string _connectionString
        +Customer FindById(int id)
        +void Insert(Customer customer)
        +void Update(Customer customer)
        +void Delete(int id)
    }

    class Database {
        <<Database>>
    }

    CustomerMapper --> ICustomerMapper
    CustomerMapper --> Database : CRUD Operations
    Customer --> CustomerMapper : Data Transfer
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the relationship between the `Customer` domain object, the `ICustomerMapper` interface, the `CustomerMapper` implementation, and the `Database`. The `CustomerMapper` interacts with the `Database` to perform CRUD operations, while the `Customer` object is transferred to and from the `CustomerMapper`.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Data Mapper Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to decouple the persistence layer from the domain logic. Here are some common use cases:

#### Decoupled Persistence Layers

In large enterprise applications, the persistence layer can become tightly coupled with the domain logic, making it difficult to maintain and extend. By using the Data Mapper Pattern, you can decouple these layers, allowing for greater flexibility and easier maintenance.

#### Handling Multiple Data Sources

In some applications, you may need to interact with multiple data sources, such as different databases or external APIs. The Data Mapper Pattern allows you to abstract the data access logic, making it easier to switch between different data sources without affecting the domain logic.

#### Example: Implementing a Product Data Mapper

Let's consider an example where we implement a Data Mapper for a `Product` domain object.

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

public interface IProductMapper
{
    Product FindById(int id);
    void Insert(Product product);
    void Update(Product product);
    void Delete(int id);
}

public class ProductMapper : IProductMapper
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;

    public ProductMapper(string connectionString)
    {
        _connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public Product FindById(int id)
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Id = @Id", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", id);

            using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
            {
                if (reader.Read())
                {
                    return new Product
                    {
                        Id = (int)reader["Id"],
                        Name = (string)reader["Name"],
                        Price = (decimal)reader["Price"]
                    };
                }
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public void Insert(Product product)
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO Products (Name, Price) VALUES (@Name, @Price)", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Name", product.Name);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Price", product.Price);
            command.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
    }

    public void Update(Product product)
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("UPDATE Products SET Name = @Name, Price = @Price WHERE Id = @Id", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Name", product.Name);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Price", product.Price);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", product.Id);
            command.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
    }

    public void Delete(int id)
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            var command = new SqlCommand("DELETE FROM Products WHERE Id = @Id", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", id);
            command.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Data Mapper Pattern, consider the following:

- **Performance**: The Data Mapper Pattern can introduce additional complexity and overhead, especially in large applications. Ensure that your implementation is optimized for performance.

- **Complexity**: While the Data Mapper Pattern provides a clean separation of concerns, it can also increase the complexity of your codebase. Ensure that your team is familiar with the pattern and its implementation.

- **Testing**: The Data Mapper Pattern can make testing more challenging, as it involves interactions with the database. Consider using mocking frameworks to test your Data Mapper implementations.

### Differences and Similarities

The Data Mapper Pattern is often compared to the Active Record Pattern. Here are some key differences:

- **Data Mapper**: Separates the domain logic from the persistence logic, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability. The domain objects are independent of the database schema.

- **Active Record**: Combines the domain logic and persistence logic in a single object. This pattern is simpler to implement but can lead to tighter coupling between the domain and persistence layers.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with the Data Mapper Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided. Here are some suggestions:

- Add additional fields to the `Customer` and `Product` domain objects and update the Data Mapper implementations accordingly.
- Implement a Data Mapper for a different domain object, such as `Order` or `Invoice`.
- Experiment with different database technologies, such as Entity Framework or Dapper, to see how they can be integrated with the Data Mapper Pattern.
