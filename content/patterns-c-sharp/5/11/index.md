## 5.11 Extension Object Pattern

In the realm of software design, the ability to extend the functionality of objects without altering their structure is a powerful tool. The Extension Object Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows developers to add new capabilities to objects dynamically. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the class hierarchy is fixed, or when you want to keep the core class clean and focused on its primary responsibilities.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Extension Object Pattern is to enable the addition of new functionality to objects without modifying their existing structure. This is achieved by attaching extension objects that encapsulate the new behavior. This pattern is especially beneficial when dealing with closed class hierarchies or when you want to avoid the pitfalls of subclassing.

### Key Participants

1. **Core Object**: The object to which new functionality will be added.
2. **Extension Object**: The object that encapsulates the new functionality.
3. **Extension Manager**: Manages the extensions and facilitates the interaction between the core object and its extensions.

### Applicability

- When you need to add functionality to objects without modifying their structure.
- When subclassing is not feasible or desirable.
- In plugin systems where new features can be added dynamically.
- When implementing feature toggles that can be enabled or disabled at runtime.

### Implementing Extension Objects in C#

In C#, the Extension Object Pattern can be implemented using extension methods and composition. Let's explore these techniques in detail.

#### Using Extension Methods

Extension methods in C# provide a way to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code. They are defined as static methods in a static class and use the `this` keyword to specify the type they extend.

```csharp
public static class StringExtensions
{
    // Extension method to reverse a string
    public static string Reverse(this string str)
    {
        char[] charArray = str.ToCharArray();
        Array.Reverse(charArray);
        return new string(charArray);
    }
}

// Usage
string original = "Hello, World!";
string reversed = original.Reverse();
Console.WriteLine(reversed); // Output: !dlroW ,olleH
```

In this example, we define an extension method `Reverse` for the `string` type. This method can be called on any string instance, providing additional functionality without altering the `string` class itself.

#### Using Composition

Composition is another powerful technique for implementing the Extension Object Pattern. By composing objects, you can add new behavior dynamically.

```csharp
public interface IFeature
{
    void Execute();
}

public class CoreObject
{
    private readonly List<IFeature> _features = new List<IFeature>();

    public void AddFeature(IFeature feature)
    {
        _features.Add(feature);
    }

    public void ExecuteFeatures()
    {
        foreach (var feature in _features)
        {
            feature.Execute();
        }
    }
}

public class LoggingFeature : IFeature
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Logging feature executed.");
    }
}

public class SecurityFeature : IFeature
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Security feature executed.");
    }
}

// Usage
CoreObject core = new CoreObject();
core.AddFeature(new LoggingFeature());
core.AddFeature(new SecurityFeature());
core.ExecuteFeatures();
// Output:
// Logging feature executed.
// Security feature executed.
```

In this example, `CoreObject` can dynamically add and execute features. Each feature implements the `IFeature` interface, allowing for flexible and extensible behavior.

### Adding Functionality at Runtime

One of the significant advantages of the Extension Object Pattern is the ability to add functionality at runtime. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the requirements may change, or new features need to be integrated without redeploying the entire application.

#### Enhancing Objects Without Altering Class Definitions

By using extension methods and composition, you can enhance objects without altering their class definitions. This approach promotes the Open/Closed Principle, one of the SOLID principles, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Extension Object Pattern is widely used in various scenarios, including plugin systems and feature toggles.

#### Plugin Systems

In a plugin system, new features can be added dynamically without modifying the core application. This is achieved by defining a common interface for plugins and allowing the application to load and execute them at runtime.

```csharp
public interface IPlugin
{
    void Run();
}

public class PluginManager
{
    private readonly List<IPlugin> _plugins = new List<IPlugin>();

    public void LoadPlugin(IPlugin plugin)
    {
        _plugins.Add(plugin);
    }

    public void ExecutePlugins()
    {
        foreach (var plugin in _plugins)
        {
            plugin.Run();
        }
    }
}

public class SamplePlugin : IPlugin
{
    public void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sample plugin executed.");
    }
}

// Usage
PluginManager manager = new PluginManager();
manager.LoadPlugin(new SamplePlugin());
manager.ExecutePlugins();
// Output: Sample plugin executed.
```

In this example, `PluginManager` manages a collection of plugins, allowing them to be loaded and executed dynamically.

#### Feature Toggles

Feature toggles allow you to enable or disable features at runtime, providing flexibility in feature management and deployment.

```csharp
public interface IFeatureToggle
{
    bool IsEnabled { get; }
    void Execute();
}

public class FeatureToggleManager
{
    private readonly List<IFeatureToggle> _features = new List<IFeatureToggle>();

    public void AddFeature(IFeatureToggle feature)
    {
        _features.Add(feature);
    }

    public void ExecuteEnabledFeatures()
    {
        foreach (var feature in _features)
        {
            if (feature.IsEnabled)
            {
                feature.Execute();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class BetaFeature : IFeatureToggle
{
    public bool IsEnabled => true;

    public void Execute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Beta feature executed.");
    }
}

// Usage
FeatureToggleManager toggleManager = new FeatureToggleManager();
toggleManager.AddFeature(new BetaFeature());
toggleManager.ExecuteEnabledFeatures();
// Output: Beta feature executed.
```

In this example, `FeatureToggleManager` manages features that can be toggled on or off, allowing for dynamic feature management.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Extension Object Pattern, consider the following:

- **Performance**: Adding extensions dynamically can introduce overhead. Ensure that the performance impact is acceptable for your application.
- **Complexity**: While the pattern provides flexibility, it can also increase complexity. Use it judiciously to avoid overengineering.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure that extensions are compatible with the core object and do not introduce conflicts.

### Differences and Similarities

The Extension Object Pattern is often compared to the Decorator Pattern. While both patterns add functionality to objects, the key difference lies in their approach. The Decorator Pattern wraps objects to add behavior, whereas the Extension Object Pattern attaches extensions to add functionality.

### Visualizing the Extension Object Pattern

To better understand the Extension Object Pattern, let's visualize the relationship between the core object and its extensions using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CoreObject {
        +AddFeature(IFeature)
        +ExecuteFeatures()
    }
    class IFeature {
        <<interface>>
        +Execute()
    }
    class LoggingFeature {
        +Execute()
    }
    class SecurityFeature {
        +Execute()
    }
    CoreObject --> IFeature
    LoggingFeature ..|> IFeature
    SecurityFeature ..|> IFeature
```

**Diagram Description**: The class diagram illustrates the `CoreObject` class, which can add and execute features. The `IFeature` interface defines the contract for features, and `LoggingFeature` and `SecurityFeature` are concrete implementations of this interface.
