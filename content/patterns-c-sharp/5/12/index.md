## 5.12 Converter vs. Adapter

In the realm of software design patterns, particularly within the C# programming language, understanding the nuances between different patterns is crucial for creating robust and maintainable applications. Two such patterns that often come up in discussions are the **Converter** and **Adapter** patterns. While they may seem similar at first glance, they serve distinct purposes and are used in different contexts. This section will delve into these two patterns, exploring their differences, use cases, and how they can be effectively implemented in C#.

### Introduction to Structural Design Patterns

Before diving into the specifics of the Converter and Adapter patterns, it's essential to understand the broader category they belong to: **Structural Design Patterns**. These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to be rewritten. Structural patterns simplify the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

### Understanding the Converter Pattern

#### Intent

The **Converter Pattern** is primarily used to transform data from one format to another. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with different data representations that need to be converted to a common format for processing or storage.

#### Key Participants

- **Source Data**: The original data format that needs conversion.
- **Target Data**: The desired data format after conversion.
- **Converter**: The component responsible for transforming the source data into the target format.

#### Applicability

Use the Converter Pattern when:

- You need to transform data between different formats.
- You want to encapsulate the conversion logic in a single place.
- You aim to decouple the conversion logic from the business logic.

#### Sample Code Snippet

Let's consider a scenario where we need to convert temperature data from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

```csharp
public class TemperatureConverter
{
    public double CelsiusToFahrenheit(double celsius)
    {
        return (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
    }

    public double FahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit)
    {
        return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
    }
}

// Usage
var converter = new TemperatureConverter();
double fahrenheit = converter.CelsiusToFahrenheit(25);
double celsius = converter.FahrenheitToCelsius(77);
```

In this example, the `TemperatureConverter` class encapsulates the logic for converting temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

#### Design Considerations

- **Simplicity**: Keep the conversion logic simple and focused.
- **Reusability**: Design the converter to be reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Performance**: Ensure that the conversion process is efficient, especially when dealing with large data sets.

### Understanding the Adapter Pattern

#### Intent

The **Adapter Pattern** is used to allow incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate.

#### Key Participants

- **Client**: The component that requires a specific interface.
- **Adaptee**: The existing component with an incompatible interface.
- **Adapter**: The component that adapts the interface of the adaptee to the target interface.

#### Applicability

Use the Adapter Pattern when:

- You want to use an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the rest of your system.
- You need to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
- You want to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

#### Sample Code Snippet

Consider a scenario where we have a legacy system that provides temperature data in Fahrenheit, but our new system expects data in Celsius.

```csharp
// Legacy system
public class FahrenheitSensor
{
    public double GetTemperature()
    {
        return 77; // Example temperature in Fahrenheit
    }
}

// Target interface
public interface ICelsiusSensor
{
    double GetTemperature();
}

// Adapter
public class TemperatureAdapter : ICelsiusSensor
{
    private readonly FahrenheitSensor _fahrenheitSensor;

    public TemperatureAdapter(FahrenheitSensor fahrenheitSensor)
    {
        _fahrenheitSensor = fahrenheitSensor;
    }

    public double GetTemperature()
    {
        double fahrenheit = _fahrenheitSensor.GetTemperature();
        return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9; // Convert to Celsius
    }
}

// Usage
FahrenheitSensor legacySensor = new FahrenheitSensor();
ICelsiusSensor adapter = new TemperatureAdapter(legacySensor);
double temperatureInCelsius = adapter.GetTemperature();
```

In this example, the `TemperatureAdapter` class adapts the `FahrenheitSensor` to the `ICelsiusSensor` interface, allowing the legacy system to work with the new system.

#### Design Considerations

- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the adapter correctly translates the interface of the adaptee to the target interface.
- **Transparency**: The adapter should be transparent to the client, meaning the client should not be aware of the adaptation process.
- **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of the adaptation, especially if it involves complex transformations.

### Differences and Similarities

#### Differences

- **Purpose**: The Converter Pattern is focused on transforming data, while the Adapter Pattern is about transforming interfaces.
- **Use Case**: Use the Converter Pattern when you need to change data formats and the Adapter Pattern when you need to make incompatible interfaces work together.
- **Implementation**: Converters typically involve straightforward data transformation logic, whereas adapters involve wrapping one interface with another.

#### Similarities

- **Encapsulation**: Both patterns encapsulate specific logic—conversion logic in the case of converters and interface adaptation logic in the case of adapters.
- **Decoupling**: Both patterns help decouple different parts of a system, promoting modularity and flexibility.

### Visualizing the Patterns

To better understand the differences between the Converter and Adapter patterns, let's visualize them using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Converter Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SourceData {
        +format: String
    }
    class TargetData {
        +format: String
    }
    class Converter {
        +convert(source: SourceData): TargetData
    }
    SourceData --> Converter
    Converter --> TargetData
```

**Caption**: This diagram illustrates the Converter Pattern, where `SourceData` is transformed into `TargetData` through a `Converter`.

#### Adapter Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Client {
        +request(): void
    }
    class Target {
        +request(): void
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +specificRequest(): void
    }
    class Adapter {
        +request(): void
    }
    Client --> Target
    Adapter --> Target
    Adapter --> Adaptee
```

**Caption**: This diagram shows the Adapter Pattern, where the `Adapter` bridges the `Adaptee` and the `Target` interface, allowing the `Client` to interact with the `Adaptee`.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of these patterns, try modifying the code examples:

- **Converter Pattern**: Extend the `TemperatureConverter` to include conversions between Kelvin and Celsius.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Create an adapter for a different legacy system that provides temperature data in Kelvin, adapting it to the `ICelsiusSensor` interface.
