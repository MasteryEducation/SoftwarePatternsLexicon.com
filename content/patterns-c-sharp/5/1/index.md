## 5.1 Adapter Design Pattern

In the realm of software engineering, the Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that plays a crucial role in enabling incompatible interfaces to work together. This pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to communicate seamlessly. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of the Adapter Design Pattern, its implementation in C#, and explore its practical applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Adapter Design Pattern is to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. It involves creating an adapter that translates the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating with legacy code or third-party libraries that do not match the current system's interface.

### Key Participants

1. **Target Interface**: The interface that the client expects.
2. **Adaptee**: The existing interface that needs adaptation.
3. **Adapter**: The class that implements the target interface and translates the requests to the adaptee.

### Implementing Adapter in C#

The Adapter Design Pattern can be implemented in two primary ways in C#: using class adapters and object adapters. Let's explore each approach in detail.

#### Class Adapter

A class adapter uses inheritance to adapt one interface to another. This approach involves creating a new class that inherits from the adaptee and implements the target interface.

```csharp
// Target interface
public interface ITarget
{
    void Request();
}

// Adaptee class
public class Adaptee
{
    public void SpecificRequest()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Called SpecificRequest()");
    }
}

// Adapter class
public class ClassAdapter : Adaptee, ITarget
{
    public void Request()
    {
        // Translate the request to the adaptee's method
        SpecificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        ITarget target = new ClassAdapter();
        target.Request();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ClassAdapter` inherits from `Adaptee` and implements the `ITarget` interface. The `Request` method in the adapter translates the call to the `SpecificRequest` method of the adaptee.

#### Object Adapter

An object adapter uses composition to achieve the same goal. Instead of inheriting from the adaptee, the adapter holds a reference to an instance of the adaptee.

```csharp
// Target interface
public interface ITarget
{
    void Request();
}

// Adaptee class
public class Adaptee
{
    public void SpecificRequest()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Called SpecificRequest()");
    }
}

// Adapter class
public class ObjectAdapter : ITarget
{
    private readonly Adaptee _adaptee;

    public ObjectAdapter(Adaptee adaptee)
    {
        _adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public void Request()
    {
        // Translate the request to the adaptee's method
        _adaptee.SpecificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        ITarget target = new ObjectAdapter(adaptee);
        target.Request();
    }
}
```

In the object adapter example, the `ObjectAdapter` holds a reference to an `Adaptee` instance and implements the `ITarget` interface. The `Request` method delegates the call to the `SpecificRequest` method of the adaptee.

### Class vs. Object Adapters

Understanding the differences between class and object adapters is crucial for selecting the appropriate approach for your use case.

- **Class Adapter**:
  - Uses inheritance.
  - Can only adapt a single class (no multiple inheritance in C#).
  - Directly accesses protected members of the adaptee.

- **Object Adapter**:
  - Uses composition.
  - Can adapt multiple classes.
  - More flexible and adheres to the composition over inheritance principle.

### Use Cases and Examples

The Adapter Design Pattern is widely used in various scenarios, particularly when dealing with legacy systems or third-party libraries.

#### Integrating with Legacy Code

When integrating new functionality into an existing system, you may encounter legacy code with interfaces that do not match the new system's requirements. The adapter pattern allows you to create a bridge between the old and new interfaces without modifying the legacy code.

#### Example: Media Player

Consider a media player application that supports playing audio files. You want to add support for video files, but the existing interface only supports audio playback.

```csharp
// Existing audio player interface
public interface IAudioPlayer
{
    void PlayAudio(string fileName);
}

// New video player class
public class VideoPlayer
{
    public void PlayVideo(string fileName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Playing video file: {fileName}");
    }
}

// Adapter class
public class MediaAdapter : IAudioPlayer
{
    private readonly VideoPlayer _videoPlayer;

    public MediaAdapter(VideoPlayer videoPlayer)
    {
        _videoPlayer = videoPlayer;
    }

    public void PlayAudio(string fileName)
    {
        // Translate audio play request to video play request
        _videoPlayer.PlayVideo(fileName);
    }
}

// Client code
public class MediaPlayer
{
    private readonly IAudioPlayer _audioPlayer;

    public MediaPlayer(IAudioPlayer audioPlayer)
    {
        _audioPlayer = audioPlayer;
    }

    public void Play(string fileName)
    {
        _audioPlayer.PlayAudio(fileName);
    }
}

// Usage
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        VideoPlayer videoPlayer = new VideoPlayer();
        IAudioPlayer mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter(videoPlayer);
        MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(mediaAdapter);

        mediaPlayer.Play("example.mp4");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MediaAdapter` adapts the `VideoPlayer` class to the `IAudioPlayer` interface, allowing the `MediaPlayer` to play video files using the existing audio interface.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Adapter Design Pattern, consider the following:

- **Interface Compatibility**: Ensure that the adapter correctly translates between the target and adaptee interfaces.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of any performance overhead introduced by the adapter, especially in performance-critical applications.
- **Maintainability**: Keep the adapter implementation simple and maintainable to facilitate future changes.

### Differences and Similarities

The Adapter Design Pattern is often confused with the Facade Pattern. While both patterns provide a simplified interface, the key difference is their intent:

- **Adapter Pattern**: Focuses on converting an interface into another interface that clients expect.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem without altering its functionality.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

To better understand the Adapter Design Pattern, let's visualize the relationships between the target, adaptee, and adapter using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ITarget {
        +Request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
        +SpecificRequest()
    }
    class Adapter {
        +Request()
    }
    ITarget <|.. Adapter
    Adapter --> Adaptee
```

In this diagram, the `Adapter` class implements the `ITarget` interface and holds a reference to the `Adaptee` class, translating requests from the target to the adaptee.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Adapter Design Pattern, try modifying the code examples provided. Experiment with different interfaces and adaptees to see how the adapter pattern can be applied in various scenarios. Consider creating adapters for other types of media players or integrating additional functionality into the existing system.
