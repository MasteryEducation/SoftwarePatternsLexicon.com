## 5.6 Flyweight Design Pattern

The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that focuses on minimizing memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share common data. By using the Flyweight pattern, we can significantly reduce the memory footprint of applications, making them more efficient and scalable.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Flyweight Design Pattern is to use sharing to support a large number of fine-grained objects efficiently. This is achieved by separating intrinsic and extrinsic states, allowing the intrinsic state to be shared among multiple objects, while the extrinsic state is stored outside the shared objects.

### Key Participants

1. **Flyweight Interface**: Declares an interface through which flyweights can receive and act on extrinsic state.
2. **Concrete Flyweight**: Implements the Flyweight interface and adds storage for intrinsic state, which is shared across multiple objects.
3. **Flyweight Factory**: Creates and manages flyweight objects, ensuring that shared objects are reused.
4. **Client**: Maintains references to flyweight objects and computes or stores extrinsic state.

### Applicability

The Flyweight Design Pattern is applicable when:
- An application uses a large number of objects.
- Storage costs are high due to the sheer quantity of objects.
- Most object state can be made extrinsic.
- Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed.

### Implementing Flyweight in C#

Let's explore how to implement the Flyweight Design Pattern in C#. We'll create a simple example of a text editor where each character is represented as an object. The intrinsic state will be the character's font and style, while the extrinsic state will be its position in the document.

#### Step 1: Define the Flyweight Interface

```csharp
public interface ICharacter
{
    void Display(int row, int column);
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Concrete Flyweight

```csharp
public class Character : ICharacter
{
    private readonly char _symbol;
    private readonly string _font;
    private readonly string _style;

    public Character(char symbol, string font, string style)
    {
        _symbol = symbol;
        _font = font;
        _style = style;
    }

    public void Display(int row, int column)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Character: {_symbol}, Font: {_font}, Style: {_style}, Position: ({row}, {column})");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Flyweight Factory

```csharp
public class CharacterFactory
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, Character> _characters = new Dictionary<string, Character>();

    public Character GetCharacter(char symbol, string font, string style)
    {
        string key = $"{symbol}-{font}-{style}";
        if (!_characters.ContainsKey(key))
        {
            _characters[key] = new Character(symbol, font, style);
        }
        return _characters[key];
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Use the Flyweight Pattern in the Client

```csharp
public class TextEditor
{
    private readonly CharacterFactory _characterFactory = new CharacterFactory();

    public void DisplayText(string text, string font, string style)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < text.Length; i++)
        {
            Character character = _characterFactory.GetCharacter(text[i], font, style);
            character.Display(0, i);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Test the Implementation

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        TextEditor editor = new TextEditor();
        editor.DisplayText("Hello, World!", "Arial", "Bold");
    }
}
```

### Memory Optimization

The Flyweight Design Pattern is particularly effective in reducing memory usage in applications where many objects share common data. By separating intrinsic and extrinsic states, we can ensure that shared data is stored only once, significantly reducing the memory footprint.

#### Visualizing Flyweight Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ICharacter {
        +Display(int row, int column)
    }
    class Character {
        -char _symbol
        -string _font
        -string _style
        +Display(int row, int column)
    }
    class CharacterFactory {
        -Dictionary~string, Character~ _characters
        +GetCharacter(char symbol, string font, string style) Character
    }
    class TextEditor {
        -CharacterFactory _characterFactory
        +DisplayText(string text, string font, string style)
    }
    ICharacter <|.. Character
    CharacterFactory --> Character
    TextEditor --> CharacterFactory
```

### Use Cases and Examples

The Flyweight Design Pattern is commonly used in scenarios where memory optimization is crucial. Here are some typical use cases:

#### Text Rendering

In text rendering, each character can be represented as an object. By using the Flyweight pattern, we can share the font and style information among multiple characters, reducing memory usage.

#### Game Development

In game development, objects like trees, rocks, or enemies that appear multiple times can share common data such as textures or models. This allows for efficient memory usage and improved performance.

#### Graphical User Interfaces

In graphical user interfaces, widgets that share common properties can use the Flyweight pattern to minimize memory consumption.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Flyweight Design Pattern, consider the following:

- **Identify Intrinsic and Extrinsic States**: Clearly distinguish between intrinsic state (shared) and extrinsic state (unique to each object).
- **Manage Extrinsic State**: Ensure that the client manages the extrinsic state, as it is not stored within the flyweight objects.
- **Performance Trade-offs**: While the Flyweight pattern reduces memory usage, it may increase the complexity of the code and the time required to manage extrinsic state.

### Differences and Similarities

The Flyweight Design Pattern is often compared to other patterns like the Singleton and Prototype patterns. Here are some key differences and similarities:

- **Singleton vs. Flyweight**: The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance, while the Flyweight pattern allows multiple instances that share common data.
- **Prototype vs. Flyweight**: The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying existing ones, while the Flyweight pattern reuses existing objects to minimize memory usage.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Flyweight pattern by modifying the code examples. Try changing the font and style of characters in the text editor or adding new types of objects in a game development scenario. Observe how the Flyweight pattern helps in reducing memory usage.
