## 5.3 Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of the Composite Design Pattern, its implementation in C#, and its various applications.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Composite Design Pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is particularly useful when dealing with tree structures, such as file systems, GUI components, or organizational hierarchies.

### Key Participants

1. **Component**: Declares the interface for objects in the composition and implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes.
2. **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.
3. **Composite**: Defines behavior for components having children and stores child components.
4. **Client**: Manipulates objects in the composition through the component interface.

### Applicability

Use the Composite Design Pattern when:
- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- You want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

### Implementing Composite in C#

#### Using Recursive Structures and Interfaces

To implement the Composite Design Pattern in C#, we start by defining a common interface for both composite and leaf objects. This interface will declare operations that are common to both types of objects.

```csharp
// Component
public interface IGraphic
{
    void Draw();
}

// Leaf
public class Circle : IGraphic
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

// Composite
public class CompositeGraphic : IGraphic
{
    private List<IGraphic> _graphics = new List<IGraphic>();

    public void Add(IGraphic graphic)
    {
        _graphics.Add(graphic);
    }

    public void Remove(IGraphic graphic)
    {
        _graphics.Remove(graphic);
    }

    public void Draw()
    {
        foreach (var graphic in _graphics)
        {
            graphic.Draw();
        }
    }
}

// Client
public class Client
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create leaf objects
        IGraphic circle1 = new Circle();
        IGraphic circle2 = new Circle();

        // Create composite object
        CompositeGraphic compositeGraphic = new CompositeGraphic();
        compositeGraphic.Add(circle1);
        compositeGraphic.Add(circle2);

        // Draw composite
        compositeGraphic.Draw();
    }
}
```

In this example, `IGraphic` is the component interface, `Circle` is a leaf, and `CompositeGraphic` is the composite class that can contain multiple `IGraphic` objects.

#### Handling Hierarchies

The Composite Design Pattern simplifies client code that deals with tree structures by allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. This is achieved by defining a common interface for all objects in the hierarchy.

### Composite Entity Pattern

The Composite Entity Pattern is a variation of the Composite Design Pattern that deals with managing a complex entity composed of multiple simpler entities. This pattern is particularly useful in enterprise applications where entities are often composed of multiple sub-entities.

#### Implementing Composite Entity in C#

```csharp
// Coarse-Grained Object
public class CoarseGrainedObject
{
    private DependentObject1 do1 = new DependentObject1();
    private DependentObject2 do2 = new DependentObject2();

    public void SetData(string data1, string data2)
    {
        do1.Data = data1;
        do2.Data = data2;
    }

    public string[] GetData()
    {
        return new string[] { do1.Data, do2.Data };
    }
}

// Dependent Object 1
public class DependentObject1
{
    public string Data { get; set; }
}

// Dependent Object 2
public class DependentObject2
{
    public string Data { get; set; }
}

// Composite Entity
public class CompositeEntity
{
    private CoarseGrainedObject cgo = new CoarseGrainedObject();

    public void SetData(string data1, string data2)
    {
        cgo.SetData(data1, data2);
    }

    public string[] GetData()
    {
        return cgo.GetData();
    }
}

// Client
public class CompositeEntityClient
{
    private CompositeEntity compositeEntity = new CompositeEntity();

    public void PrintData()
    {
        foreach (var data in compositeEntity.GetData())
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Data: " + data);
        }
    }

    public void SetData(string data1, string data2)
    {
        compositeEntity.SetData(data1, data2);
    }
}
```

In this example, `CompositeEntity` manages a `CoarseGrainedObject` which in turn manages `DependentObject1` and `DependentObject2`. The client interacts with the composite entity to manage the data.

#### Use Cases and Examples

The Composite Entity Pattern is commonly used in enterprise applications to manage complex entities composed of multiple sub-entities. This pattern helps in reducing the complexity of the client code by providing a unified interface to manage the entity.

### Composite View Pattern

The Composite View Pattern is used in UI frameworks to handle composite structures. This pattern allows developers to create complex UI components by composing simpler components.

#### Implementing Composite View in C#

```csharp
// Component
public interface IViewComponent
{
    void Render();
}

// Leaf
public class TextView : IViewComponent
{
    public void Render()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rendering TextView");
    }
}

// Composite
public class CompositeView : IViewComponent
{
    private List<IViewComponent> _components = new List<IViewComponent>();

    public void Add(IViewComponent component)
    {
        _components.Add(component);
    }

    public void Remove(IViewComponent component)
    {
        _components.Remove(component);
    }

    public void Render()
    {
        foreach (var component in _components)
        {
            component.Render();
        }
    }
}

// Client
public class ViewClient
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create leaf objects
        IViewComponent textView1 = new TextView();
        IViewComponent textView2 = new TextView();

        // Create composite object
        CompositeView compositeView = new CompositeView();
        compositeView.Add(textView1);
        compositeView.Add(textView2);

        // Render composite view
        compositeView.Render();
    }
}
```

In this example, `IViewComponent` is the component interface, `TextView` is a leaf, and `CompositeView` is the composite class that can contain multiple `IViewComponent` objects.

#### Use Cases and Examples

The Composite View Pattern is commonly used in UI frameworks to create complex UI components by composing simpler components. This pattern helps in reducing the complexity of the client code by providing a unified interface to manage the UI components.

### Use Cases and Examples

#### GUI Components

The Composite Design Pattern is widely used in GUI frameworks to represent complex UI components as compositions of simpler components. For example, a window can contain panels, buttons, and text fields, each of which can be treated as a component.

#### File System Representations

The Composite Design Pattern is also used to represent file systems, where directories can contain files and other directories. This allows clients to treat files and directories uniformly.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Composite Design Pattern, consider the following:
- **Uniformity**: Ensure that the component interface provides a uniform way to interact with both leaf and composite objects.
- **Efficiency**: Be mindful of the performance implications of traversing large composite structures.
- **Flexibility**: Design the component interface to be flexible enough to accommodate future changes.

### Differences and Similarities

The Composite Design Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern. While both patterns involve recursive composition, the Composite Pattern focuses on part-whole hierarchies, whereas the Decorator Pattern focuses on adding responsibilities to objects dynamically.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by:
- Adding new types of leaf objects and composite objects.
- Implementing additional operations in the component interface.
- Creating more complex tree structures and observing how the client code interacts with them.

### Visualizing the Composite Design Pattern

Below is a class diagram representing the Composite Design Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IGraphic {
        <<interface>>
        +Draw()
    }
    class Circle {
        +Draw()
    }
    class CompositeGraphic {
        +Add(IGraphic)
        +Remove(IGraphic)
        +Draw()
    }
    IGraphic <|-- Circle
    IGraphic <|-- CompositeGraphic
    CompositeGraphic o-- IGraphic
```

This diagram illustrates the relationships between the component, leaf, and composite classes.
