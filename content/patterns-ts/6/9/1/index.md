## 6.9.1 Implementing Strategy in TypeScript

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to switch between different algorithms dynamically without altering the client code that uses them.

### Understanding the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern consists of three main components:

1. **Strategy Interface**: Declares a method that all concrete strategies must implement. This method represents the algorithm that can be varied.

2. **Concrete Strategy Classes**: Implement the strategy interface, providing specific algorithms or behaviors.

3. **Context Class**: Maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the algorithm's execution to the current strategy. It allows changing the strategy at runtime.

### Implementing Strategy Pattern in TypeScript

Let's dive into implementing the Strategy Pattern in TypeScript. We will create a simple example of a payment processing system that can switch between different payment methods (strategies) such as credit card, PayPal, and bank transfer.

#### Step 1: Define the Strategy Interface

First, we define a `PaymentStrategy` interface that declares the `pay` method. This method will be implemented by all concrete strategies.

```typescript
// PaymentStrategy.ts
export interface PaymentStrategy {
    pay(amount: number): void;
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Strategy Classes

Next, we create concrete strategy classes that implement the `PaymentStrategy` interface. Each class will provide a different implementation of the `pay` method.

```typescript
// CreditCardStrategy.ts
import { PaymentStrategy } from './PaymentStrategy';

export class CreditCardStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    pay(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Paying $${amount} using Credit Card.`);
    }
}

// PayPalStrategy.ts
import { PaymentStrategy } from './PaymentStrategy';

export class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    pay(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Paying $${amount} using PayPal.`);
    }
}

// BankTransferStrategy.ts
import { PaymentStrategy } from './PaymentStrategy';

export class BankTransferStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    pay(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Paying $${amount} using Bank Transfer.`);
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Context Class

The `PaymentContext` class will hold a reference to a `PaymentStrategy` and delegate the payment operation to the current strategy. It also provides a method to change the strategy at runtime.

```typescript
// PaymentContext.ts
import { PaymentStrategy } from './PaymentStrategy';

export class PaymentContext {
    private strategy: PaymentStrategy;

    constructor(strategy: PaymentStrategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    setStrategy(strategy: PaymentStrategy): void {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    executePayment(amount: number): void {
        this.strategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Demonstrate Strategy Switching

Now, let's demonstrate how to use the `PaymentContext` to switch between different payment strategies dynamically.

```typescript
// Main.ts
import { PaymentContext } from './PaymentContext';
import { CreditCardStrategy } from './CreditCardStrategy';
import { PayPalStrategy } from './PayPalStrategy';
import { BankTransferStrategy } from './BankTransferStrategy';

// Initialize context with a credit card strategy
const paymentContext = new PaymentContext(new CreditCardStrategy());
paymentContext.executePayment(100);

// Change strategy to PayPal
paymentContext.setStrategy(new PayPalStrategy());
paymentContext.executePayment(200);

// Change strategy to Bank Transfer
paymentContext.setStrategy(new BankTransferStrategy());
paymentContext.executePayment(300);
```

### Exploring TypeScript's Role in the Strategy Pattern

TypeScript enhances the Strategy Pattern's implementation through its robust type system and interfaces. Here are some key benefits:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures that all strategies adhere to the `PaymentStrategy` interface, preventing runtime errors due to missing methods.

- **Intellisense and Autocompletion**: With TypeScript, you get better development tools support, including code completion and navigation, which speeds up development.

- **Refactoring**: TypeScript's static typing makes it easier to refactor code, as changes in one part of the codebase are automatically reflected in other parts.

### Managing Dependencies and Ensuring Interface Adherence

When implementing the Strategy Pattern, it's crucial to manage dependencies effectively and ensure that all strategies adhere to the required interface. Here are some best practices:

- **Use Dependency Injection**: Inject strategies into the context class to decouple the context from specific strategy implementations. This approach enhances testability and flexibility.

- **Leverage TypeScript's Interface**: Define clear interfaces for strategies to ensure consistent behavior across different implementations.

- **Test Strategies Independently**: Write unit tests for each strategy to verify that they conform to the expected behavior.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

To better understand the Strategy Pattern, let's visualize the relationships between the components using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +pay(amount: number): void
    }

    class CreditCardStrategy {
        +pay(amount: number): void
    }

    class PayPalStrategy {
        +pay(amount: number): void
    }

    class BankTransferStrategy {
        +pay(amount: number): void
    }

    class PaymentContext {
        -strategy: PaymentStrategy
        +setStrategy(strategy: PaymentStrategy): void
        +executePayment(amount: number): void
    }

    PaymentStrategy <|.. CreditCardStrategy
    PaymentStrategy <|.. PayPalStrategy
    PaymentStrategy <|.. BankTransferStrategy
    PaymentContext --> PaymentStrategy
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the Strategy Pattern's structure, showing the `PaymentStrategy` interface and its concrete implementations. The `PaymentContext` class holds a reference to a `PaymentStrategy` and delegates the payment operation to it.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Strategy Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- **Add a New Payment Method**: Implement a new strategy class, such as `CryptoCurrencyStrategy`, and integrate it into the `PaymentContext`.

- **Enhance the Context Class**: Add logging or validation logic to the `PaymentContext` to track strategy changes or validate payment amounts.

- **Implement Strategy Caching**: Modify the `PaymentContext` to cache strategies and reuse them instead of creating new instances each time.

### Knowledge Check

To reinforce your understanding of the Strategy Pattern, consider these questions:

- How does the Strategy Pattern differ from the State Pattern?
- What are the advantages of using the Strategy Pattern in a large-scale application?
- How can TypeScript's type system prevent common mistakes when implementing the Strategy Pattern?

### Summary

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful tool for designing flexible and maintainable systems. By encapsulating algorithms in separate classes, you can easily switch between different behaviors without modifying client code. TypeScript's type system and interfaces further enhance the pattern's implementation, providing type safety and better development tools support.

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive systems using the Strategy Pattern. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
