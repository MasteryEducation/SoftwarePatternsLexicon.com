## 6.11 Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without altering their classes. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to perform various operations across a set of objects with different interfaces or classes. By separating the operations from the objects, the Visitor Pattern promotes the Open/Closed Principle, enabling your code to be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Understanding the Visitor Pattern

#### Intent

The primary intent of the Visitor Pattern is to define a new operation on a set of objects without changing the objects themselves. It achieves this by allowing you to create a visitor class that implements the desired operation. This visitor class can then be applied to the objects, which "accept" the visitor and allow it to perform its operation.

#### Problem Solved

In object-oriented programming, adding new functionality often requires modifying existing classes. This can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend. The Visitor Pattern solves this problem by decoupling the operations from the object structure, allowing you to add new operations without modifying the existing codebase.

### Key Components of the Visitor Pattern

1. **Visitor**: An interface declaring visit methods for each concrete element type.
2. **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements each visit method with specific operations.
3. **Element**: An interface or abstract class that accepts a visitor.
4. **ConcreteElement**: Implements the accept method to call the visitor's corresponding method.
5. **ObjectStructure**: A collection of elements to traverse.

Let's explore each component in detail.

#### Visitor

The `Visitor` interface declares a `visit` method for each type of element in the object structure. This allows the visitor to perform different operations depending on the element type.

```typescript
interface Visitor {
  visitConcreteElementA(element: ConcreteElementA): void;
  visitConcreteElementB(element: ConcreteElementB): void;
}
```

#### ConcreteVisitor

The `ConcreteVisitor` class implements the `Visitor` interface and defines the specific operations to be performed on each element type.

```typescript
class ConcreteVisitor implements Visitor {
  visitConcreteElementA(element: ConcreteElementA): void {
    console.log(`Processing ConcreteElementA with value: ${element.operationA()}`);
  }

  visitConcreteElementB(element: ConcreteElementB): void {
    console.log(`Processing ConcreteElementB with value: ${element.operationB()}`);
  }
}
```

#### Element

The `Element` interface or abstract class declares an `accept` method that takes a visitor as an argument. This method allows the visitor to perform its operation on the element.

```typescript
interface Element {
  accept(visitor: Visitor): void;
}
```

#### ConcreteElement

The `ConcreteElement` classes implement the `Element` interface and define the `accept` method. This method calls the visitor's corresponding visit method, passing itself as an argument.

```typescript
class ConcreteElementA implements Element {
  accept(visitor: Visitor): void {
    visitor.visitConcreteElementA(this);
  }

  operationA(): string {
    return "ElementA";
  }
}

class ConcreteElementB implements Element {
  accept(visitor: Visitor): void {
    visitor.visitConcreteElementB(this);
  }

  operationB(): string {
    return "ElementB";
  }
}
```

#### ObjectStructure

The `ObjectStructure` is a collection of elements that can be traversed. It provides a method to accept a visitor, which will be applied to each element in the collection.

```typescript
class ObjectStructure {
  private elements: Element[] = [];

  addElement(element: Element): void {
    this.elements.push(element);
  }

  accept(visitor: Visitor): void {
    for (const element of this.elements) {
      element.accept(visitor);
    }
  }
}
```

### Visualizing the Visitor Pattern

To better understand the relationships between these components, let's visualize the Visitor Pattern using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Visitor {
        <<interface>>
        +visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA)
        +visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB)
    }
    class ConcreteVisitor {
        +visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA)
        +visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB)
    }
    class Element {
        <<interface>>
        +accept(Visitor)
    }
    class ConcreteElementA {
        +accept(Visitor)
        +operationA() string
    }
    class ConcreteElementB {
        +accept(Visitor)
        +operationB() string
    }
    class ObjectStructure {
        +addElement(Element)
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    Visitor <|.. ConcreteVisitor
    Element <|.. ConcreteElementA
    Element <|.. ConcreteElementB
    ObjectStructure o-- Element
```

### Implementing the Visitor Pattern in TypeScript

Now that we have a conceptual understanding of the Visitor Pattern, let's implement it in TypeScript with a practical example.

#### Example: File System Visitor

Consider a file system where we have different types of files and directories. We want to perform various operations, such as calculating the total size or listing all files, without modifying the existing file and directory classes.

```typescript
// Visitor interface
interface FileSystemVisitor {
  visitFile(file: File): void;
  visitDirectory(directory: Directory): void;
}

// ConcreteVisitor for calculating total size
class SizeCalculatorVisitor implements FileSystemVisitor {
  private totalSize: number = 0;

  visitFile(file: File): void {
    this.totalSize += file.getSize();
  }

  visitDirectory(directory: Directory): void {
    // Directories themselves don't have a size, but we can traverse them
  }

  getTotalSize(): number {
    return this.totalSize;
  }
}

// Element interface
interface FileSystemElement {
  accept(visitor: FileSystemVisitor): void;
}

// ConcreteElement for File
class File implements FileSystemElement {
  constructor(private name: string, private size: number) {}

  accept(visitor: FileSystemVisitor): void {
    visitor.visitFile(this);
  }

  getSize(): number {
    return this.size;
  }
}

// ConcreteElement for Directory
class Directory implements FileSystemElement {
  private elements: FileSystemElement[] = [];

  constructor(private name: string) {}

  accept(visitor: FileSystemVisitor): void {
    visitor.visitDirectory(this);
    for (const element of this.elements) {
      element.accept(visitor);
    }
  }

  addElement(element: FileSystemElement): void {
    this.elements.push(element);
  }
}

// ObjectStructure
class FileSystem {
  private elements: FileSystemElement[] = [];

  addElement(element: FileSystemElement): void {
    this.elements.push(element);
  }

  accept(visitor: FileSystemVisitor): void {
    for (const element of this.elements) {
      element.accept(visitor);
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const file1 = new File("file1.txt", 100);
const file2 = new File("file2.txt", 200);
const directory = new Directory("documents");
directory.addElement(file1);
directory.addElement(file2);

const fileSystem = new FileSystem();
fileSystem.addElement(directory);

const sizeCalculator = new SizeCalculatorVisitor();
fileSystem.accept(sizeCalculator);
console.log(`Total size: ${sizeCalculator.getTotalSize()} bytes`);
```

### Promoting the Open/Closed Principle

The Visitor Pattern promotes the Open/Closed Principle by allowing you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the classes themselves. This is achieved by defining new visitor classes that implement the desired operations. As a result, your codebase remains stable and easy to extend.

### TypeScript-Specific Considerations

When implementing the Visitor Pattern in TypeScript, consider the following:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript's static typing ensures that the visitor methods are called with the correct element types, reducing runtime errors.
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Use interfaces and abstract classes to define the `Visitor` and `Element` components, providing flexibility and extensibility.
- **Generics**: Consider using generics to create more flexible visitor interfaces that can work with different element types.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Visitor Pattern, try modifying the example code to add a new operation, such as counting the number of files in the file system. Implement a new visitor class that performs this operation and test it with the existing file and directory structure.
