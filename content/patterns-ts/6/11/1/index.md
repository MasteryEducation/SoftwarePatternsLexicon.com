## 6.11.1 Implementing Visitor in TypeScript

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This separation provides a way to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Visitor Pattern in TypeScript, leveraging its type system to create flexible and maintainable code.

### Understanding the Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern involves several key components:

1. **Visitor Interface**: Defines a `visit` method for each `ConcreteElement` type.
2. **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the `Visitor` interface and provides specific operations for each element type.
3. **Element Interface**: Declares an `accept` method that takes a visitor as an argument.
4. **ConcreteElement**: Implements the `Element` interface and calls the visitor's `visit` method in `accept`.
5. **ObjectStructure**: Holds elements and allows the visitor to traverse them.

Let's delve into each component with TypeScript code examples.

### Defining the Visitor Interface

The `Visitor` interface declares a `visit` method for each `ConcreteElement` type. This interface allows visitors to perform operations on elements without knowing their concrete classes.

```typescript
// Visitor.ts
interface Visitor {
  visitBook(book: Book): void;
  visitMagazine(magazine: Magazine): void;
}
```

### Implementing ConcreteVisitor Classes

Concrete visitors implement the `Visitor` interface and provide specific operations for each element type. This is where the actual logic for processing elements resides.

```typescript
// ConcreteVisitor.ts
class PriceCalculatorVisitor implements Visitor {
  visitBook(book: Book): void {
    console.log(`Calculating price for book: ${book.title}`);
    // Implement price calculation logic for books
  }

  visitMagazine(magazine: Magazine): void {
    console.log(`Calculating price for magazine: ${magazine.title}`);
    // Implement price calculation logic for magazines
  }
}

class DisplayVisitor implements Visitor {
  visitBook(book: Book): void {
    console.log(`Displaying book: ${book.title}`);
    // Implement display logic for books
  }

  visitMagazine(magazine: Magazine): void {
    console.log(`Displaying magazine: ${magazine.title}`);
    // Implement display logic for magazines
  }
}
```

### Defining the Element Interface

The `Element` interface declares an `accept` method that takes a visitor as an argument. This method allows elements to accept visitors and delegate the processing to them.

```typescript
// Element.ts
interface Element {
  accept(visitor: Visitor): void;
}
```

### Implementing ConcreteElement Classes

Concrete elements implement the `Element` interface and call the visitor's `visit` method in `accept`. This is where double dispatch comes into play, allowing the correct method to be selected based on both the element and visitor types.

```typescript
// ConcreteElement.ts
class Book implements Element {
  constructor(public title: string, public price: number) {}

  accept(visitor: Visitor): void {
    visitor.visitBook(this);
  }
}

class Magazine implements Element {
  constructor(public title: string, public issueNumber: number) {}

  accept(visitor: Visitor): void {
    visitor.visitMagazine(this);
  }
}
```

### Creating an ObjectStructure

The `ObjectStructure` holds elements and allows the visitor to traverse them. It can be a simple collection of elements or a more complex structure.

```typescript
// ObjectStructure.ts
class Library {
  private elements: Element[] = [];

  addElement(element: Element): void {
    this.elements.push(element);
  }

  accept(visitor: Visitor): void {
    for (const element of this.elements) {
      element.accept(visitor);
    }
  }
}
```

### How Double Dispatch Works

Double dispatch is a technique used in the Visitor Pattern to select the correct method based on both the visitor and element types. In TypeScript, this is achieved through the `accept` method in `ConcreteElement` classes, which calls the appropriate `visit` method on the visitor.

### Handling Elements of Different Types

TypeScript's type system aids in handling elements of different types by ensuring that each `ConcreteElement` implements the `accept` method, which enforces type safety. This allows us to define operations specific to each element type without casting or type checking.

### Considerations and Potential Tight Coupling

While the Visitor Pattern provides flexibility in adding new operations, it can lead to tight coupling between visitors and element classes. Each time a new element type is added, all visitor classes must be updated to handle the new type. This trade-off should be considered when deciding to use the Visitor Pattern.

### Try It Yourself

To experiment with the Visitor Pattern, try modifying the `PriceCalculatorVisitor` to apply discounts based on the element type or add a new `ConcreteVisitor` that collects statistics about the elements.

### Visualizing the Visitor Pattern

Below is a class diagram illustrating the relationships between the components of the Visitor Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Visitor {
        <<interface>>
        +visitBook(Book)
        +visitMagazine(Magazine)
    }

    class PriceCalculatorVisitor {
        +visitBook(Book)
        +visitMagazine(Magazine)
    }

    class DisplayVisitor {
        +visitBook(Book)
        +visitMagazine(Magazine)
    }

    class Element {
        <<interface>>
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    class Book {
        +accept(Visitor)
        +title: string
        +price: number
    }

    class Magazine {
        +accept(Visitor)
        +title: string
        +issueNumber: number
    }

    class Library {
        +addElement(Element)
        +accept(Visitor)
    }

    Visitor <|.. PriceCalculatorVisitor
    Visitor <|.. DisplayVisitor
    Element <|.. Book
    Element <|.. Magazine
    Library o-- Element
```
