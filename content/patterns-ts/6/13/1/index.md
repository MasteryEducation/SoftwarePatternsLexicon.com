## 6.13.1 Implementing Pub/Sub in TypeScript

The Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern is a powerful messaging paradigm that decouples the sender of a message (the publisher) from its recipients (the subscribers). This pattern is widely used in scenarios where multiple components need to react to events or changes in state without being tightly coupled to the source of those events. In this section, we'll explore how to implement the Pub/Sub pattern in TypeScript, leveraging both Node.js's built-in `EventEmitter` and custom implementations.

### Understanding the Publish/Subscribe Pattern

The Pub/Sub pattern involves three main components:

1. **Publisher**: This component emits events or messages. It doesn't know who will receive these messages.
2. **Subscriber**: This component registers to receive specific events or messages. It defines handlers or callbacks to process the received data.
3. **Event Bus/Broker**: This intermediary facilitates communication between publishers and subscribers. It manages the registration of subscribers and the distribution of messages.

The Pub/Sub pattern is particularly useful for:

- **Decoupling components**: Publishers and subscribers can evolve independently.
- **Scalability**: New subscribers can be added without modifying existing publishers.
- **Flexibility**: Subscribers can choose which events to listen to.

### Implementing Pub/Sub with Node.js `EventEmitter`

Node.js provides a built-in `EventEmitter` class that makes it easy to implement the Pub/Sub pattern. Let's start by creating a simple event bus using `EventEmitter`.

```typescript
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';

// Create an instance of EventEmitter
const eventBus = new EventEmitter();

// Define a publisher function
function publishEvent(eventType: string, data: any) {
  console.log(`Publishing event: ${eventType}`);
  eventBus.emit(eventType, data);
}

// Define a subscriber function
function subscribeToEvent(eventType: string, handler: (data: any) => void) {
  console.log(`Subscribing to event: ${eventType}`);
  eventBus.on(eventType, handler);
}

// Example usage
subscribeToEvent('userLoggedIn', (data) => {
  console.log(`User logged in: ${data.username}`);
});

publishEvent('userLoggedIn', { username: 'john_doe' });
```

#### Key Points

- **EventEmitter**: This class provides methods like `emit`, `on`, and `off` to manage events.
- **Publish/Subscribe**: The `publishEvent` function emits an event, and the `subscribeToEvent` function registers a handler for a specific event type.
- **Decoupling**: The publisher and subscriber are decoupled, allowing them to evolve independently.

### Building a Custom Pub/Sub System

While `EventEmitter` is convenient, sometimes you need more control over the Pub/Sub system. Let's build a custom implementation.

```typescript
type EventHandler = (data: any) => void;

class EventBus {
  private events: Map<string, EventHandler[]> = new Map();

  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler) {
    if (!this.events.has(eventType)) {
      this.events.set(eventType, []);
    }
    this.events.get(eventType)!.push(handler);
  }

  publish(eventType: string, data: any) {
    const handlers = this.events.get(eventType);
    if (handlers) {
      handlers.forEach(handler => handler(data));
    }
  }

  unsubscribe(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler) {
    const handlers = this.events.get(eventType);
    if (handlers) {
      this.events.set(eventType, handlers.filter(h => h !== handler));
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const customEventBus = new EventBus();

customEventBus.subscribe('orderCreated', (data) => {
  console.log(`Order created: ${data.orderId}`);
});

customEventBus.publish('orderCreated', { orderId: '12345' });
```

#### Key Points

- **Custom Event Bus**: We created a simple event bus with methods to subscribe, publish, and unsubscribe.
- **Flexibility**: This implementation allows for more control, such as managing multiple subscribers and filtering events.

### Managing Multiple Subscribers and Event Filtering

In a real-world application, you may have multiple subscribers for a single event type. It's important to manage these subscriptions efficiently and provide mechanisms for filtering events.

#### Handling Multiple Subscribers

Our custom event bus already supports multiple subscribers for a single event type. Each subscriber's handler is called when the event is published.

#### Event Filtering

You can extend the event bus to support filtering, allowing subscribers to receive only specific events based on custom criteria.

```typescript
class FilteredEventBus extends EventBus {
  subscribeWithFilter(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler, filter: (data: any) => boolean) {
    const filteredHandler = (data: any) => {
      if (filter(data)) {
        handler(data);
      }
    };
    this.subscribe(eventType, filteredHandler);
  }
}

// Example usage
const filteredEventBus = new FilteredEventBus();

filteredEventBus.subscribeWithFilter('orderCreated', (data) => {
  console.log(`High-value order created: ${data.orderId}`);
}, (data) => data.value > 1000);

filteredEventBus.publish('orderCreated', { orderId: '12345', value: 1500 });
```

#### Key Points

- **Filtered Subscriptions**: Subscribers can register handlers with filters to receive only relevant events.
- **Efficiency**: Filtering reduces unnecessary processing for subscribers.

### Error Handling in Pub/Sub Systems

Error handling is crucial in a Pub/Sub system to ensure that failures in one subscriber do not affect others. Let's discuss some strategies for managing errors.

#### Isolating Subscriber Errors

Ensure that errors in one subscriber do not propagate to others by using try-catch blocks within handlers.

```typescript
customEventBus.subscribe('orderCreated', (data) => {
  try {
    // Process the event
    console.log(`Processing order: ${data.orderId}`);
    if (!data.orderId) {
      throw new Error('Invalid order ID');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error processing order: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

#### Logging and Monitoring

Implement logging and monitoring to track errors and system health. This can be done using logging libraries or external monitoring tools.

### Handling Asynchronous Events and Race Conditions

In modern applications, events are often processed asynchronously. This introduces challenges such as race conditions, where the order of event processing affects the outcome.

#### Asynchronous Event Handling

Use asynchronous functions and promises to handle events asynchronously.

```typescript
customEventBus.subscribe('orderCreated', async (data) => {
  console.log(`Processing order asynchronously: ${data.orderId}`);
  await processOrder(data);
});

async function processOrder(data: any) {
  // Simulate asynchronous processing
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`Order processed: ${data.orderId}`);
    resolve(true);
  }, 1000));
}
```

#### Avoiding Race Conditions

Implement mechanisms to ensure that events are processed in the correct order or that shared resources are accessed safely.

- **Locks and Semaphores**: Use locks to control access to shared resources.
- **Event Queues**: Use queues to ensure that events are processed in the order they are received.

### Visualizing the Pub/Sub Architecture

To better understand the flow of events in a Pub/Sub system, let's visualize the architecture using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Publisher
    participant EventBus
    participant Subscriber1
    participant Subscriber2

    Publisher->>EventBus: Publish Event
    EventBus->>Subscriber1: Notify Event
    EventBus->>Subscriber2: Notify Event
    Subscriber1->>EventBus: Acknowledge
    Subscriber2->>EventBus: Acknowledge
```

#### Diagram Explanation

- **Publisher**: Emits an event to the `EventBus`.
- **EventBus**: Distributes the event to all registered subscribers.
- **Subscribers**: Process the event and acknowledge receipt.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying them to suit your needs:

- **Add More Events**: Create additional event types and handlers.
- **Implement Advanced Filtering**: Extend the filtering logic to handle more complex criteria.
- **Simulate Errors**: Introduce errors in handlers and observe how they are managed.
- **Test Asynchronous Processing**: Modify the asynchronous example to include multiple steps or dependencies.
