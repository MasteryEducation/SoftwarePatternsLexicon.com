## 6.2 Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all the information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations, as well as providing the ability to log, queue, and undo commands. Let's delve into the Command Pattern, exploring its components, benefits, and implementation in TypeScript.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

**Definition**: The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides the ability to log, queue, and undo commands.

**Intent**: The primary intent of the Command Pattern is to decouple the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it. This separation allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in the codebase.

**Problem Solved**: In traditional programming, a direct method call ties the caller to the callee, making it difficult to change the method being called without altering the caller. The Command Pattern solves this by encapsulating the method call in a command object, which can be passed around, stored, and executed at a later time.

### Key Components of the Command Pattern

The Command Pattern consists of several key components that work together to encapsulate requests and execute them flexibly:

1. **Command**: An interface that declares an `execute` method. This interface is implemented by all concrete command classes.

2. **ConcreteCommand**: Implements the `Command` interface and defines the binding between a Receiver and an action. It holds the logic for executing the command.

3. **Receiver**: The object that knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request. It contains the actual logic to execute the command.

4. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request. It stores the command and can execute it at any time.

5. **Client**: Creates ConcreteCommand objects and sets their receivers. It is responsible for creating and configuring the command objects.

### Diagram: Command Pattern Structure

To better understand the relationships and interactions between these components, let's visualize the Command Pattern structure using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        <<interface>>
        +execute()
    }
    class ConcreteCommand {
        -Receiver receiver
        +execute()
    }
    class Receiver {
        +action()
    }
    class Invoker {
        -Command command
        +setCommand(Command)
        +executeCommand()
    }
    class Client {
        +main()
    }

    Command <|.. ConcreteCommand
    ConcreteCommand --> Receiver
    Invoker --> Command
    Client --> ConcreteCommand
```

**Diagram Explanation**:  
- The `Command` interface is implemented by `ConcreteCommand`, which binds a specific action on the `Receiver`.
- The `Invoker` holds a reference to a `Command` and can execute it.
- The `Client` is responsible for creating and configuring the `ConcreteCommand` and associating it with the `Receiver`.

### Implementing the Command Pattern in TypeScript

Let's implement the Command Pattern in TypeScript to see how these components come together in practice.

#### Step 1: Define the Command Interface

The `Command` interface declares the `execute` method that all concrete commands must implement.

```typescript
// Command.ts
export interface Command {
    execute(): void;
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Receiver Class

The `Receiver` class contains the business logic for executing the command.

```typescript
// Receiver.ts
export class Light {
    on(): void {
        console.log("The light is on");
    }

    off(): void {
        console.log("The light is off");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement ConcreteCommand Classes

Concrete commands implement the `Command` interface and define the binding between a `Receiver` and an action.

```typescript
// LightOnCommand.ts
import { Command } from './Command';
import { Light } from './Receiver';

export class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private light: Light;

    constructor(light: Light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    execute(): void {
        this.light.on();
    }
}

// LightOffCommand.ts
import { Command } from './Command';
import { Light } from './Receiver';

export class LightOffCommand implements Command {
    private light: Light;

    constructor(light: Light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    execute(): void {
        this.light.off();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create the Invoker Class

The `Invoker` class is responsible for executing the command.

```typescript
// RemoteControl.ts
import { Command } from './Command';

export class RemoteControl {
    private command: Command;

    setCommand(command: Command): void {
        this.command = command;
    }

    pressButton(): void {
        this.command.execute();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Assemble the Components in the Client

The `Client` creates and configures the command objects and sets them on the `Invoker`.

```typescript
// Client.ts
import { Light } from './Receiver';
import { LightOnCommand, LightOffCommand } from './ConcreteCommand';
import { RemoteControl } from './Invoker';

const light = new Light();
const lightOn = new LightOnCommand(light);
const lightOff = new LightOffCommand(light);

const remote = new RemoteControl();

remote.setCommand(lightOn);
remote.pressButton(); // Output: The light is on

remote.setCommand(lightOff);
remote.pressButton(); // Output: The light is off
```

### Extensibility and Flexibility

One of the main advantages of the Command Pattern is its extensibility. New commands can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle. To add a new command, simply create a new class that implements the `Command` interface and define the desired behavior.

### Visualizing Command Execution Flow

To further illustrate the execution flow of commands, let's use a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Invoker
    participant Command
    participant Receiver

    Client->>Invoker: setCommand(command)
    Client->>Invoker: pressButton()
    Invoker->>Command: execute()
    Command->>Receiver: action()
```

**Diagram Explanation**:  
- The `Client` sets a command on the `Invoker`.
- When the `Invoker`'s button is pressed, it calls the `execute` method on the `Command`.
- The `Command` then calls the appropriate action on the `Receiver`.

### Advanced Concepts and Considerations

#### Undo Functionality

The Command Pattern can be extended to support undo functionality by storing the previous state and providing an `undo` method in the `Command` interface. This is particularly useful in applications like text editors where undo/redo operations are common.

```typescript
// Command.ts
export interface Command {
    execute(): void;
    undo(): void;
}

// LightOnCommand.ts
export class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private light: Light;

    constructor(light: Light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    execute(): void {
        this.light.on();
    }

    undo(): void {
        this.light.off();
    }
}
```

#### Command Queuing and Scheduling

Commands can be queued and scheduled for execution at a later time. This is useful in scenarios where operations need to be executed in a specific order or at specific intervals.

#### Command Logging

Commands can be logged for auditing purposes. By storing a history of executed commands, you can track what operations were performed and when.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Command Pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- **Add a new command**: Implement a `DimLightCommand` that dims the light to a specific level.
- **Implement undo functionality**: Extend the existing commands to support undo operations.
- **Queue commands**: Modify the `RemoteControl` to queue multiple commands and execute them in sequence.
