## 9.2.2 Use Cases and Examples

Currying and partial application are powerful techniques in functional programming that can significantly enhance the flexibility and reusability of your code. By transforming functions and enabling partial application of arguments, these techniques allow developers to create more modular and maintainable codebases. In this section, we'll explore practical examples of how currying and partial application can simplify code, support function composition, and improve code clarity.

### Understanding Currying and Partial Application

Before diving into use cases, let's briefly revisit what currying and partial application mean:

- **Currying**: This is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This transformation allows for the gradual application of arguments, enabling more flexible function composition.

- **Partial Application**: This involves creating a new function by pre-filling some of the arguments of an existing function. This technique is particularly useful for creating specialized versions of more general-purpose functions.

### Practical Examples of Currying

Currying can simplify code by allowing you to configure functions with common parameters. Let's explore some scenarios where currying proves beneficial.

#### Example 1: Configuring a Logger Function

Imagine you have a logging function that requires a log level and a message. Currying allows you to create a specialized logger for a specific log level:

```typescript
// A generic logger function
function log(level: string, message: string): void {
  console.log(`[${level.toUpperCase()}] ${message}`);
}

// Curried version of the logger function
const curriedLog = (level: string) => (message: string) => log(level, message);

// Creating specialized loggers
const infoLog = curriedLog('info');
const errorLog = curriedLog('error');

// Using the specialized loggers
infoLog('This is an informational message.');
errorLog('An error has occurred.');
```

In this example, `curriedLog` transforms the `log` function into a curried version, allowing us to create `infoLog` and `errorLog` functions that are pre-configured with specific log levels.

#### Example 2: Configuring an HTTP Client

Currying can also be used to configure HTTP clients with common headers or base URLs:

```typescript
// A generic HTTP request function
function request(method: string, url: string, headers: Record<string, string>): void {
  console.log(`Making a ${method} request to ${url} with headers:`, headers);
}

// Curried version of the request function
const curriedRequest = (method: string) => (url: string) => (headers: Record<string, string>) => request(method, url, headers);

// Creating specialized request functions
const getRequest = curriedRequest('GET');
const postRequest = curriedRequest('POST');

// Using the specialized request functions
getRequest('https://api.example.com/data')({ 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' });
postRequest('https://api.example.com/data')({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
```

Here, `curriedRequest` allows us to create `getRequest` and `postRequest` functions that are pre-configured with HTTP methods, simplifying the creation of HTTP requests.

### Partial Application in Action

Partial application can be used to create specialized versions of general-purpose functions, reducing redundancy and improving code clarity.

#### Example 3: Event Handling

In event handling, partial application can be used to bind specific event types or handlers:

```typescript
// A generic event handler function
function handleEvent(eventType: string, handler: (event: Event) => void, event: Event): void {
  if (event.type === eventType) {
    handler(event);
  }
}

// Partially applied event handler for click events
const handleClickEvent = (handler: (event: Event) => void) => (event: Event) => handleEvent('click', handler, event);

// Using the specialized event handler
document.addEventListener('click', handleClickEvent((event) => {
  console.log('Click event handled:', event);
}));
```

In this example, `handleClickEvent` is a partially applied function that simplifies handling click events by pre-filling the `eventType` argument.

#### Example 4: Data Transformation

Partial application can also be used in data transformation pipelines to create reusable transformation functions:

```typescript
// A generic data transformation function
function transformData(transformFn: (data: any) => any, data: any): any {
  return transformFn(data);
}

// Partially applied transformation function for doubling numbers
const doubleNumbers = (data: number[]) => transformData((num: number) => num * 2, data);

// Using the specialized transformation function
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(doubleNumbers);
console.log('Doubled numbers:', doubled);
```

Here, `doubleNumbers` is a partially applied function that simplifies the transformation of number arrays by pre-filling the transformation function.

### Function Composition with Currying

Currying supports function composition, allowing developers to build complex functionality from simple functions.

#### Example 5: Composing Functions for Data Processing

Let's explore how currying and function composition can be used to create a data processing pipeline:

```typescript
// Simple functions for data processing
const add = (a: number) => (b: number) => a + b;
const multiply = (a: number) => (b: number) => a * b;

// Composing functions using currying
const addAndMultiply = (a: number) => (b: number) => (c: number) => multiply(a)(add(b)(c));

// Using the composed function
const result = addAndMultiply(2)(3)(4); // (3 + 4) * 2 = 14
console.log('Result of add and multiply:', result);
```

In this example, `addAndMultiply` is a composed function that combines addition and multiplication, demonstrating how currying facilitates function composition.

### Currying and Partial Application in Real-World Contexts

Currying and partial application can be applied in various real-world contexts, such as event handling, data transformation, and configuration of HTTP clients.

#### Example 6: Configuring Middleware in Express.js

In web development, currying can be used to configure middleware functions with common parameters:

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// A generic middleware function
function middleware(config: { logLevel: string }) {
  return (req: express.Request, res: express.Response, next: express.NextFunction) => {
    if (config.logLevel === 'verbose') {
      console.log(`Request to ${req.url}`);
    }
    next();
  };
}

// Curried middleware function
const curriedMiddleware = (logLevel: string) => middleware({ logLevel });

// Using the curried middleware
app.use(curriedMiddleware('verbose'));

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

Here, `curriedMiddleware` allows us to create middleware functions that are pre-configured with a specific log level, simplifying middleware configuration.

#### Example 7: Creating Specialized HTTP Clients

Partial application can be used to create specialized HTTP clients with common headers or base URLs:

```typescript
// A generic HTTP client function
function httpClient(baseUrl: string, headers: Record<string, string>, endpoint: string): void {
  console.log(`Request to ${baseUrl}${endpoint} with headers:`, headers);
}

// Partially applied HTTP client for a specific base URL
const apiClient = (endpoint: string) => httpClient('https://api.example.com', { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' }, endpoint);

// Using the specialized HTTP client
apiClient('/users');
apiClient('/posts');
```

In this example, `apiClient` is a partially applied function that simplifies making requests to a specific API by pre-filling the base URL and headers.

### Improving Code Clarity and Reducing Redundancy

Currying and partial application improve code clarity by reducing redundancy and making functions more modular and reusable. By pre-filling common arguments, these techniques allow developers to create specialized functions that are easier to understand and maintain.

### Encouraging Exploration and Application
