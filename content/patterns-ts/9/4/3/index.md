## 9.4.3 Use Cases and Examples

Lazy evaluation is a powerful concept in functional programming that defers computation until the result is actually needed. This technique can significantly improve performance and resource usage, especially when dealing with large datasets or potentially infinite sequences. In this section, we will explore practical scenarios where lazy evaluation is effectively applied, such as processing large datasets, implementing pagination or infinite scrolling, and generating infinite sequences like Fibonacci numbers. We will also provide TypeScript code snippets to illustrate these examples and discuss best practices for using lazy evaluation in your projects.

### Processing Large Datasets

When working with large datasets, it is often unnecessary and inefficient to load and process the entire dataset at once. Lazy evaluation allows us to process only the data that is needed at any given time, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

#### Example: Filtering Large Data Streams

Imagine you have a large dataset of user records, and you need to filter users based on certain criteria. Instead of loading all records into memory, you can use lazy evaluation to process the data stream as it is needed.

```typescript
function* filterUsers(users: User[], predicate: (user: User) => boolean): Generator<User> {
  for (const user of users) {
    if (predicate(user)) {
      yield user;
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const users = fetchLargeUserDataset(); // Assume this returns a large array of users
const activeUsers = filterUsers(users, user => user.isActive);

for (const user of activeUsers) {
  console.log(user.name); // Process each active user lazily
}
```

In this example, the `filterUsers` function is a generator that yields users one by one, only when they match the given predicate. This approach minimizes memory usage by not holding the entire filtered dataset in memory.

#### Best Practices

- **Use Generators**: Generators in TypeScript are a natural fit for lazy evaluation. They allow you to define sequences of values that are computed on demand.
- **Avoid Premature Optimization**: While lazy evaluation can improve performance, it is important to profile your application to ensure it is the right solution for your use case.
- **Combine with Other Functional Techniques**: Lazy evaluation works well with other functional programming techniques, such as map, filter, and reduce, to create efficient data processing pipelines.

### Implementing Pagination or Infinite Scrolling

Lazy evaluation is particularly useful for implementing pagination or infinite scrolling features, where data is loaded incrementally as the user scrolls or navigates through pages.

#### Example: Infinite Scrolling with Lazy Evaluation

Consider a scenario where you are building an application with an infinite scrolling feature to display a list of articles. Instead of loading all articles at once, you can fetch and display them as the user scrolls.

```typescript
class ArticleService {
  private currentPage = 0;

  async *fetchArticles(): AsyncGenerator<Article[]> {
    while (true) {
      const articles = await this.loadPage(this.currentPage);
      if (articles.length === 0) break;
      yield articles;
      this.currentPage++;
    }
  }

  private async loadPage(page: number): Promise<Article[]> {
    // Simulate an API call to fetch articles for the given page
    return fetch(`/api/articles?page=${page}`).then(response => response.json());
  }
}

// Usage
const articleService = new ArticleService();
const articleStream = articleService.fetchArticles();

(async () => {
  for await (const articles of articleStream) {
    renderArticles(articles); // Render articles lazily as they are fetched
  }
})();
```

In this example, the `fetchArticles` method is an asynchronous generator that fetches articles page by page. The articles are rendered as they are fetched, providing a smooth scrolling experience without overwhelming the server or client.

#### Best Practices

- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: When fetching data asynchronously, ensure that your application can handle network errors or empty responses gracefully.
- **Optimize Network Requests**: Use techniques such as caching or request batching to optimize network requests and reduce latency.
- **Monitor User Experience**: Ensure that lazy loading does not negatively impact the user experience, such as by introducing noticeable delays or jank.

### Generating Infinite Sequences

Lazy evaluation is ideal for generating infinite sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence, without precomputing the entire sequence. This allows you to work with potentially infinite data structures in a memory-efficient manner.

#### Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of an infinite sequence that can be generated lazily.

```typescript
function* fibonacci(): Generator<number> {
  let [a, b] = [0, 1];
  while (true) {
    yield a;
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
}

// Usage
const fib = fibonacci();
console.log(fib.next().value); // 0
console.log(fib.next().value); // 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // 2
console.log(fib.next().value); // 3
// Continue as needed
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` generator produces Fibonacci numbers on demand, allowing you to generate as many numbers as needed without storing the entire sequence in memory.

#### Best Practices

- **Use Infinite Generators Cautiously**: While infinite generators are powerful, ensure that your application logic includes appropriate termination conditions to prevent infinite loops.
- **Combine with Lazy Data Structures**: Consider using lazy data structures, such as lazy lists or streams, to manage infinite sequences effectively.
- **Profile Performance**: Use profiling tools to measure the performance benefits of lazy evaluation in your application, especially when dealing with large or infinite data structures.

### Encouraging Exploration of Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation is a versatile technique that can be applied to a wide range of scenarios beyond those discussed here. As you explore lazy evaluation in your projects, consider the following:

- **Identify Opportunities for Laziness**: Look for areas in your code where computations can be deferred until necessary, such as in data processing pipelines or UI rendering.
- **Experiment with Generators**: Use generators to create lazy sequences and explore how they can simplify your code and improve performance.
- **Combine with Other Patterns**: Lazy evaluation can be combined with other design patterns, such as the Iterator pattern, to create powerful and flexible solutions.

By incorporating lazy evaluation into your TypeScript projects, you can create more efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications. Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll discover new ways to leverage lazy evaluation to solve complex problems. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
