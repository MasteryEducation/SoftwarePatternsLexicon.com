## 9.3.3 Use Cases and Examples

In this section, we delve into the practical applications of monads and functional composition within TypeScript. These concepts, rooted in functional programming, offer powerful tools for managing data transformations and error handling, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases. Let's explore some scenarios where these patterns shine.

### Chaining Data Processing Steps

One of the most compelling use cases for monads is in chaining data processing steps, where each step may produce a valid result or an error. This is particularly useful in scenarios where operations need to be performed sequentially, and each operation depends on the success of the previous one.

#### Example: Processing User Input

Consider a scenario where we need to process user input, validate it, and then transform it into a format suitable for storage. Each step in this process could potentially fail, and we want to handle these failures gracefully.

```typescript
type Result<T> = { isSuccess: true; value: T } | { isSuccess: false; error: string };

function validateInput(input: string): Result<string> {
    if (input.trim() === "") {
        return { isSuccess: false, error: "Input cannot be empty" };
    }
    return { isSuccess: true, value: input.trim() };
}

function transformInput(input: string): Result<number> {
    const number = parseInt(input, 10);
    if (isNaN(number)) {
        return { isSuccess: false, error: "Input must be a number" };
    }
    return { isSuccess: true, value: number };
}

function storeInput(input: number): Result<string> {
    // Simulate storage operation
    return { isSuccess: true, value: `Stored number: ${input}` };
}

function processInput(input: string): Result<string> {
    return validateInput(input)
        .flatMap(transformInput)
        .flatMap(storeInput);
}

const result = processInput("42");
if (result.isSuccess) {
    console.log(result.value);
} else {
    console.error(result.error);
}
```

In this example, we define a `Result` type to encapsulate success and error states. Each function returns a `Result`, and we use a hypothetical `flatMap` method to chain these operations, propagating errors automatically.

#### Performance Implications

Using monads for chaining can introduce some overhead due to the additional function calls and object allocations. However, the benefits in terms of code clarity and maintainability often outweigh these costs, especially in complex workflows.

### Simplifying Complex Conditional Logic

Functional composition allows us to simplify complex conditional logic by composing functions that handle nullable or optional values. This is particularly useful in scenarios where data may be incomplete or optional, and we want to apply a series of transformations only if the data is present.

#### Example: Optional User Profile Updates

Imagine a scenario where we want to update a user's profile, but only if certain optional fields are provided.

```typescript
type UserProfile = {
    name?: string;
    age?: number;
    email?: string;
};

function updateName(profile: UserProfile, name?: string): UserProfile {
    return name ? { ...profile, name } : profile;
}

function updateAge(profile: UserProfile, age?: number): UserProfile {
    return age ? { ...profile, age } : profile;
}

function updateEmail(profile: UserProfile, email?: string): UserProfile {
    return email ? { ...profile, email } : profile;
}

function updateUserProfile(profile: UserProfile, updates: Partial<UserProfile>): UserProfile {
    return [updateName, updateAge, updateEmail].reduce(
        (updatedProfile, updateFn) => updateFn(updatedProfile, updates[updateFn.name as keyof UserProfile]),
        profile
    );
}

const initialProfile: UserProfile = { name: "Alice" };
const updatedProfile = updateUserProfile(initialProfile, { age: 30, email: "alice@example.com" });
console.log(updatedProfile);
```

In this example, we use functional composition to apply a series of update functions to a user profile. Each function checks if the corresponding field is present and updates the profile accordingly.

#### Trade-offs

While functional composition can simplify code, it may also obscure the logic flow if overused. It's important to strike a balance between readability and abstraction.

### Managing Asynchronous Operations

Monads and functional composition are also effective for managing asynchronous operations with consistent error handling paths. This is particularly useful in modern web applications where asynchronous data fetching and processing are common.

#### Example: Fetching and Processing API Data

Consider a scenario where we need to fetch data from an API, process it, and handle any errors that occur during the process.

```typescript
type AsyncResult<T> = Promise<Result<T>>;

async function fetchData(url: string): AsyncResult<string> {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const data = await response.text();
        return { isSuccess: true, value: data };
    } catch (error) {
        return { isSuccess: false, error: error.message };
    }
}

async function processData(data: string): AsyncResult<number> {
    try {
        const processedData = parseInt(data, 10);
        if (isNaN(processedData)) {
            throw new Error("Data is not a valid number");
        }
        return { isSuccess: true, value: processedData };
    } catch (error) {
        return { isSuccess: false, error: error.message };
    }
}

async function execute(url: string): Promise<void> {
    const result = await fetchData(url)
        .then(result => result.isSuccess ? processData(result.value) : Promise.resolve(result));

    if (result.isSuccess) {
        console.log(`Processed data: ${result.value}`);
    } else {
        console.error(`Error: ${result.error}`);
    }
}

execute("https://api.example.com/data");
```

In this example, we use `AsyncResult` to represent asynchronous operations that can succeed or fail. We chain these operations using `then`, ensuring that errors are propagated consistently.

#### Encouragement to Explore

By embracing functional programming concepts like monads and functional composition, you can enhance your TypeScript codebases, making them more robust and maintainable. These patterns encourage a declarative style of coding, where the focus is on what to do rather than how to do it.

### Visualizing the Monad Workflow

To better understand how monads work in chaining operations, let's visualize the workflow using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Validate Input]
    B -->|Success| C[Transform Input]
    B -->|Error| E[Handle Error]
    C -->|Success| D[Store Input]
    C -->|Error| E
    D --> F[End]
    E --> F
```

This flowchart illustrates the sequential processing of input data, where each step can either succeed and pass the result to the next step or fail and trigger error handling.
