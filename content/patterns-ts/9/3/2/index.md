## 9.3.2 Functional Composition Techniques

In the realm of functional programming, function composition is a cornerstone concept that allows developers to build complex operations by combining simpler functions. This approach not only enhances code modularity and reusability but also aligns with the principles of immutability and statelessness, which are pivotal in functional programming. In this section, we will delve into the art of function composition in TypeScript, exploring its significance, techniques, and practical applications.

### Understanding Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. The output of one function becomes the input of the next, creating a pipeline of operations. This technique is valuable because it allows us to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces, each represented by a function.

#### Why is Function Composition Valuable?

1. **Modularity**: By composing functions, we can create modular code where each function has a single responsibility. This makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain.

2. **Reusability**: Composed functions can be reused across different parts of an application, reducing code duplication.

3. **Immutability**: Function composition encourages the use of pure functions, which do not alter their inputs and have no side effects, leading to more predictable code.

4. **Declarative Code**: Composed functions often result in code that reads like a series of transformations, making it easier to reason about the flow of data.

### Basic Function Composition in TypeScript

Let's start with a simple example of function composition in TypeScript. Suppose we have two functions: one that doubles a number and another that adds five to a number.

```typescript
function double(x: number): number {
  return x * 2;
}

function addFive(x: number): number {
  return x + 5;
}

// Composing the functions manually
function doubleThenAddFive(x: number): number {
  return addFive(double(x));
}

console.log(doubleThenAddFive(10)); // Output: 25
```

In this example, `doubleThenAddFive` is a composed function that first doubles a number and then adds five to it. This manual composition works, but as the number of functions increases, it becomes cumbersome.

### Utility Functions for Composition

To streamline the composition process, we can use utility functions like `compose` and `pipe`. These functions abstract the composition logic, allowing us to focus on the operations themselves.

#### The `compose` Function

The `compose` function applies functions from right to left. Let's implement a simple version of `compose` in TypeScript:

```typescript
function compose<T>(...fns: Array<(arg: T) => T>): (arg: T) => T {
  return (arg: T) => fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), arg);
}

const composedFunction = compose(addFive, double);
console.log(composedFunction(10)); // Output: 25
```

#### The `pipe` Function

Conversely, the `pipe` function applies functions from left to right, which can be more intuitive when reading code. Here's how you can implement `pipe`:

```typescript
function pipe<T>(...fns: Array<(arg: T) => T>): (arg: T) => T {
  return (arg: T) => fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), arg);
}

const pipedFunction = pipe(double, addFive);
console.log(pipedFunction(10)); // Output: 25
```

### Leveraging Libraries for Function Composition

While implementing `compose` and `pipe` manually is educational, in real-world applications, we often rely on libraries that provide these utilities. Libraries like [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) offer robust implementations of these functions.

#### Using Ramda for Composition

Ramda is a functional programming library for JavaScript that emphasizes immutability and side-effect-free functions. Here's how you can use Ramda's `compose` and `pipe`:

```typescript
import { compose, pipe } from 'ramda';

const composedWithRamda = compose(addFive, double);
console.log(composedWithRamda(10)); // Output: 25

const pipedWithRamda = pipe(double, addFive);
console.log(pipedWithRamda(10)); // Output: 25
```

### Function Composition with Asynchronous Code

In modern applications, dealing with asynchronous operations is common. Function composition can be extended to handle asynchronous functions, often using Promises or async/await syntax.

#### Composing Asynchronous Functions

Let's consider two asynchronous functions: one that fetches user data and another that processes it.

```typescript
async function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<{ name: string }> {
  // Simulate an API call
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve({ name: 'John Doe' }), 1000)
  );
}

async function processUserData(user: { name: string }): Promise<string> {
  return `Processed user: ${user.name}`;
}

// Composing asynchronous functions
async function fetchAndProcessUser(userId: string): Promise<string> {
  const user = await fetchUserData(userId);
  return processUserData(user);
}

fetchAndProcessUser('123').then(console.log); // Output: Processed user: John Doe
```

#### Using `async`/`await` with Composition

When composing asynchronous functions, `async`/`await` can make the code more readable and maintainable.

```typescript
async function composedAsyncFunction(userId: string): Promise<string> {
  const user = await fetchUserData(userId);
  return await processUserData(user);
}

composedAsyncFunction('123').then(console.log); // Output: Processed user: John Doe
```

### Monads and Functional Composition

Monads are a powerful abstraction in functional programming that enable function composition, especially with side effects like asynchronous operations. In TypeScript, Promises can be seen as a monadic structure.

#### Understanding Monads

A Monad is a design pattern used to handle program-wide concerns in a functional way. It provides a way to chain operations while abstracting away the underlying complexity, such as error handling or asynchronous execution.

#### Using Monads for Composition

Consider the use of Promises as a Monad for composing asynchronous operations. The `then` method allows us to chain operations in a clean and functional manner.

```typescript
fetchUserData('123')
  .then(processUserData)
  .then(console.log); // Output: Processed user: John Doe
```

### Combining Multiple Transformations

Function composition shines when we need to apply multiple transformations or computations to data. Let's explore a practical example involving data transformation.

#### Example: Data Transformation Pipeline

Suppose we have a list of numbers, and we want to apply a series of transformations: double each number, filter out numbers greater than 10, and then sum the remaining numbers.

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const double = (x: number) => x * 2;
const isLessThanOrEqualToTen = (x: number) => x <= 10;
const sum = (acc: number, x: number) => acc + x;

const transformAndSum = pipe(
  (nums: number[]) => nums.map(double),
  (nums: number[]) => nums.filter(isLessThanOrEqualToTen),
  (nums: number[]) => nums.reduce(sum, 0)
);

console.log(transformAndSum(numbers)); // Output: 20
```

### Type Considerations in Function Composition

TypeScript's type system plays a crucial role in ensuring that composed functions are type-safe. When composing functions, it's essential to ensure that the output type of one function matches the input type of the next.

#### Type Inference and Composition

TypeScript can often infer types in composed functions, but explicit type annotations can help prevent errors and improve readability.

```typescript
function composeTyped<A, B, C>(
  f: (b: B) => C,
  g: (a: A) => B
): (a: A) => C {
  return (a: A) => f(g(a));
}

const doubleThenAddFiveTyped = composeTyped(addFive, double);
console.log(doubleThenAddFiveTyped(10)); // Output: 25
```

### Best Practices for Function Composition

To effectively use function composition in TypeScript applications, consider the following best practices:

1. **Use Pure Functions**: Ensure that functions do not have side effects and do not alter their inputs.

2. **Leverage Libraries**: Use libraries like Ramda or Lodash for robust composition utilities.

3. **Type Safety**: Pay attention to TypeScript's type system to ensure that composed functions are type-safe.

4. **Readability**: Use `pipe` for left-to-right composition, which often aligns with the natural reading order.

5. **Modularity**: Break down complex operations into smaller, reusable functions.

6. **Testing**: Test individual functions and composed functions to ensure correctness.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code snippets to deepen your understanding of function composition. Try modifying the functions or adding new transformations to see how the composed functions behave.

```typescript
// Define your own transformations
const increment = (x: number) => x + 1;
const square = (x: number) => x * x;

// Compose them
const incrementThenSquare = pipe(increment, square);

console.log(incrementThenSquare(3)); // Output: 16
```

### Visualizing Function Composition

To better understand how function composition works, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input] --> B[Function 1: double]
    B --> C[Function 2: addFive]
    C --> D[Output]
```

This diagram illustrates the flow of data through a composed function, where each function transforms the data before passing it to the next.
