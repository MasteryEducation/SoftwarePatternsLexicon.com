## 11.4.2 Applying Patterns to Improve Design

Refactoring is a critical process in software development, allowing us to improve the design, structure, and readability of code without altering its external behavior. In this section, we will explore how to apply design patterns to enhance code design during refactoring. We'll match specific code smells or design issues with corresponding design patterns, provide detailed refactoring examples, and discuss the impact of these changes on the existing codebase. Let's dive in!

### Identifying Code Smells and Design Issues

Before we can apply design patterns, we need to identify common code smells and design issues that indicate the need for refactoring. Here are a few examples:

- **Long Method**: Methods that are excessively long and difficult to understand.
- **Duplicated Code**: Code that is repeated in multiple places.
- **Large Class**: Classes that have too many responsibilities.
- **Conditional Complexity**: Code with complex conditional logic.
- **Tight Coupling**: Classes that are heavily dependent on each other.

### Matching Code Smells with Design Patterns

Design patterns offer proven solutions to common design problems. By matching code smells with appropriate patterns, we can systematically improve our codebase. Here are some examples:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Use to eliminate complex conditional logic.
- **Observer Pattern**: Apply to decouple components and manage event-driven systems.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Use to manage object creation and reduce dependency on concrete classes.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Apply to add functionality to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- **Facade Pattern**: Use to simplify interactions with complex subsystems.

### Refactoring Example: Strategy Pattern

Let's start with a refactoring example using the Strategy Pattern to eliminate conditional logic.

#### Problematic Code

Consider a payment processing system with complex conditional logic:

```typescript
class PaymentProcessor {
    processPayment(paymentType: string, amount: number) {
        if (paymentType === 'credit') {
            console.log(`Processing credit payment of $${amount}`);
            // Credit payment logic
        } else if (paymentType === 'debit') {
            console.log(`Processing debit payment of $${amount}`);
            // Debit payment logic
        } else if (paymentType === 'paypal') {
            console.log(`Processing PayPal payment of $${amount}`);
            // PayPal payment logic
        } else {
            throw new Error('Unsupported payment type');
        }
    }
}
```

#### Applying the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern allows us to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Here's how we can refactor the code:

1. **Define a Strategy Interface**: Create an interface for payment strategies.

```typescript
interface PaymentStrategy {
    process(amount: number): void;
}
```

2. **Implement Concrete Strategies**: Implement different payment strategies.

```typescript
class CreditPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    process(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Processing credit payment of $${amount}`);
        // Credit payment logic
    }
}

class DebitPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    process(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Processing debit payment of $${amount}`);
        // Debit payment logic
    }
}

class PayPalPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    process(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Processing PayPal payment of $${amount}`);
        // PayPal payment logic
    }
}
```

3. **Refactor the PaymentProcessor**: Use the strategy interface to process payments.

```typescript
class PaymentProcessor {
    private strategy: PaymentStrategy;

    constructor(strategy: PaymentStrategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    processPayment(amount: number): void {
        this.strategy.process(amount);
    }

    setStrategy(strategy: PaymentStrategy): void {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
}
```

#### Improvements

- **Eliminated Conditional Logic**: The complex conditional logic is replaced with strategy objects.
- **Increased Flexibility**: New payment methods can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Adherence to SOLID Principles**: The Open/Closed Principle is maintained, allowing the class to be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Refactoring Example: Observer Pattern

Next, let's refactor a system using the Observer Pattern to manage event-driven communication.

#### Problematic Code

Consider a simple notification system where different components need to be notified of changes:

```typescript
class NotificationSystem {
    private emailService: EmailService;
    private smsService: SMSService;

    constructor() {
        this.emailService = new EmailService();
        this.smsService = new SMSService();
    }

    notify(message: string): void {
        this.emailService.sendEmail(message);
        this.smsService.sendSMS(message);
    }
}
```

#### Applying the Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing multiple observers to listen to events. Here's how we can refactor the code:

1. **Define an Observer Interface**: Create an interface for observers.

```typescript
interface Observer {
    update(message: string): void;
}
```

2. **Implement Concrete Observers**: Implement different notification services as observers.

```typescript
class EmailService implements Observer {
    update(message: string): void {
        console.log(`Sending email: ${message}`);
    }
}

class SMSService implements Observer {
    update(message: string): void {
        console.log(`Sending SMS: ${message}`);
    }
}
```

3. **Refactor the NotificationSystem**: Use the observer pattern to manage notifications.

```typescript
class NotificationSystem {
    private observers: Observer[] = [];

    addObserver(observer: Observer): void {
        this.observers.push(observer);
    }

    removeObserver(observer: Observer): void {
        this.observers = this.observers.filter(obs => obs !== observer);
    }

    notify(message: string): void {
        this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update(message));
    }
}
```

#### Improvements

- **Decoupled Components**: The notification system is decoupled from specific services.
- **Extensibility**: New notification services can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Adherence to SOLID Principles**: The Single Responsibility Principle is maintained, as each class has a single responsibility.

### Impact of Refactoring

Refactoring with design patterns can significantly improve the design and maintainability of a codebase. However, it may also require adjustments to existing code:

- **Testing**: Ensure that existing tests are updated to reflect the refactored code. Consider writing new tests for the added functionality.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes in the code structure and design.
- **Team Communication**: Communicate changes with the development team to ensure everyone is aware of the new design.

### Potential Pitfalls

While refactoring with design patterns offers many benefits, there are potential pitfalls to watch out for:

- **Overcomplicating Design**: Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity by overusing patterns.
- **Introducing Bugs**: Refactoring can introduce new bugs if not done carefully. Ensure thorough testing.
- **Performance Considerations**: Some patterns may introduce performance overhead. Evaluate the impact on performance.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the refactoring examples provided. Try modifying the code to add new payment methods or notification services. Observe how the design patterns facilitate these changes without altering existing code.

### Visualizing Design Patterns

To better understand the refactoring process, let's visualize the structure of the Strategy and Observer patterns using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Strategy Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentProcessor {
        - PaymentStrategy strategy
        + processPayment(amount: number): void
        + setStrategy(strategy: PaymentStrategy): void
    }
    class PaymentStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        + process(amount: number): void
    }
    class CreditPaymentStrategy {
        + process(amount: number): void
    }
    class DebitPaymentStrategy {
        + process(amount: number): void
    }
    class PayPalPaymentStrategy {
        + process(amount: number): void
    }
    PaymentProcessor --> PaymentStrategy
    CreditPaymentStrategy --> PaymentStrategy
    DebitPaymentStrategy --> PaymentStrategy
    PayPalPaymentStrategy --> PaymentStrategy
```

#### Observer Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class NotificationSystem {
        - Observer[] observers
        + addObserver(observer: Observer): void
        + removeObserver(observer: Observer): void
        + notify(message: string): void
    }
    class Observer {
        <<interface>>
        + update(message: string): void
    }
    class EmailService {
        + update(message: string): void
    }
    class SMSService {
        + update(message: string): void
    }
    NotificationSystem --> Observer
    EmailService --> Observer
    SMSService --> Observer
```
