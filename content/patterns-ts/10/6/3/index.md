## 10.6.3 RESTful API Patterns

In the realm of web development, RESTful APIs have become the backbone of modern web services. They provide a standardized way for applications to communicate over the web, leveraging HTTP protocols. In this section, we will delve into the principles of RESTful API design, explore common design patterns, and demonstrate how to implement these patterns using TypeScript with popular frameworks like Express, NestJS, and Hapi. We'll also cover best practices for authentication, error handling, and testing to ensure your APIs are robust and maintainable.

### Introduction to RESTful API Design Principles

REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and principles for creating web services. Let's explore some of the core principles that underpin RESTful API design:

- **Statelessness**: Each request from a client must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any session information about the client, making the API stateless.
  
- **Resource-Based URIs**: Resources, such as users or orders, are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Each resource is accessible via a unique URI, and operations on these resources are performed using standard HTTP methods.

- **Standard HTTP Methods**: RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:
  - **GET**: Retrieve a resource.
  - **POST**: Create a new resource.
  - **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
  - **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

- **Representation**: Resources can be represented in various formats, such as JSON or XML, which are returned to the client.

- **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**: Clients interact with a RESTful API entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

### Common Design Patterns in RESTful APIs

Design patterns help structure your code in a way that is both scalable and maintainable. Here are some common patterns used in RESTful API development:

#### Controller Pattern

The Controller pattern is a fundamental part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. In RESTful APIs, controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, process them, and return appropriate responses. They act as intermediaries between the client and the business logic.

```typescript
// Example of a simple controller in an Express application
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';

const app = express();

app.get('/users', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    // Logic to retrieve users
    res.json({ message: 'List of users' });
});

app.post('/users', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    // Logic to create a new user
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern abstracts the data access layer, providing a clean API for data operations. It helps separate business logic from data access logic, making the codebase easier to manage and test.

```typescript
// Example of a repository pattern in TypeScript
interface UserRepository {
    findAll(): Promise<User[]>;
    findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;
    save(user: User): Promise<void>;
}

class InMemoryUserRepository implements UserRepository {
    private users: User[] = [];

    async findAll(): Promise<User[]> {
        return this.users;
    }

    async findById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
        return this.users.find(user => user.id === id) || null;
    }

    async save(user: User): Promise<void> {
        this.users.push(user);
    }
}
```

#### Service Layer Pattern

The Service layer encapsulates business logic and orchestrates operations across multiple repositories or external services. This pattern promotes code reuse and separation of concerns.

```typescript
// Example of a service layer in TypeScript
class UserService {
    constructor(private userRepository: UserRepository) {}

    async getAllUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
        return this.userRepository.findAll();
    }

    async createUser(user: User): Promise<void> {
        // Business logic for creating a user
        await this.userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

### Building RESTful APIs with TypeScript

TypeScript, with its static typing and modern JavaScript features, is an excellent choice for building RESTful APIs. Let's explore how to use TypeScript with popular frameworks like Express, NestJS, and Hapi.

#### Using Express with TypeScript

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

```typescript
// Setting up an Express application with TypeScript
import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/api/users', async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    try {
        // Fetch users from the database
        const users = await userService.getAllUsers();
        res.json(users);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error);
    }
});

app.post('/api/users', async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    try {
        // Create a new user
        const user = req.body;
        await userService.createUser(user);
        res.status(201).json(user);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error);
    }
});

app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Using NestJS with TypeScript

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript by default and is built around the concepts of modules, controllers, and services.

```typescript
// Setting up a NestJS application
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Module({
    controllers: [UsersController],
    providers: [UsersService],
})
export class AppModule {}

// Example of a controller in NestJS
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
    constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

    @Get()
    findAll() {
        return this.usersService.getAllUsers();
    }

    @Post()
    create(@Body() user: CreateUserDto) {
        return this.usersService.createUser(user);
    }
}
```

#### Using Hapi with TypeScript

Hapi is a rich framework for building applications and services in Node.js. It is known for its powerful plugin system and configuration-driven approach.

```typescript
// Setting up a Hapi server with TypeScript
import * as Hapi from '@hapi/hapi';

const init = async () => {
    const server = Hapi.server({
        port: 3000,
        host: 'localhost',
    });

    server.route({
        method: 'GET',
        path: '/users',
        handler: async (request, h) => {
            // Fetch users from the database
            return userService.getAllUsers();
        },
    });

    server.route({
        method: 'POST',
        path: '/users',
        handler: async (request, h) => {
            // Create a new user
            const user = request.payload;
            await userService.createUser(user);
            return h.response(user).code(201);
        },
    });

    await server.start();
    console.log('Server running on %s', server.info.uri);
};

process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {
    console.log(err);
    process.exit(1);
});

init();
```

### Structuring API Endpoints and Handling Requests

When structuring API endpoints, it's essential to follow RESTful conventions to ensure consistency and predictability. Here are some guidelines:

- **Use nouns for resource names**: Endpoints should represent resources, not actions. For example, use `/users` instead of `/getUsers`.
  
- **Use HTTP methods appropriately**: Use `GET` for retrieval, `POST` for creation, `PUT` for updates, and `DELETE` for deletions.

- **Handle requests and responses consistently**: Ensure that your API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

### Implementing Middleware

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object, the response object, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. They can perform a variety of tasks such as logging, authentication, and error handling.

```typescript
// Example of middleware in an Express application
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

const loggerMiddleware = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();
};

app.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

### Authentication and Authorization Patterns

Securing your API is crucial. Let's explore some common authentication and authorization patterns:

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is widely used for authentication in RESTful APIs.

```typescript
// Example of JWT authentication in an Express application
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

const authenticateJWT = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const token = req.header('Authorization')?.split(' ')[1];

    if (!token) {
        return res.sendStatus(401);
    }

    jwt.verify(token, 'your_jwt_secret', (err, user) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.sendStatus(403);
        }
        req.user = user;
        next();
    });
};

app.use(authenticateJWT);
```

#### OAuth

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization.

### Best Practices for Error Handling and Input Validation

Proper error handling and input validation are critical for building robust APIs. Here are some best practices:

- **Use try-catch blocks**: Wrap your code in try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

- **Validate input data**: Use libraries like Joi or class-validator to validate incoming request data.

- **Return meaningful error messages**: Provide clear and concise error messages to help clients understand what went wrong.

```typescript
// Example of input validation using Joi
import Joi from 'joi';

const userSchema = Joi.object({
    name: Joi.string().min(3).required(),
    email: Joi.string().email().required(),
});

app.post('/users', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    const { error } = userSchema.validate(req.body);
    if (error) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: error.details[0].message });
    }
    // Proceed with creating the user
});
```

### API Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

Documenting your API is essential for both developers and users. Swagger/OpenAPI is a popular tool for generating interactive API documentation.

```typescript
// Setting up Swagger in an Express application
import swaggerUi from 'swagger-ui-express';
import swaggerJsDoc from 'swagger-jsdoc';

const swaggerOptions = {
    swaggerDefinition: {
        info: {
            title: 'User API',
            version: '1.0.0',
        },
    },
    apis: ['app.js'], // Path to the API docs
};

const swaggerDocs = swaggerJsDoc(swaggerOptions);
app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocs));
```

### Testing RESTful APIs

Testing is a crucial part of API development. It ensures that your API works as expected and helps catch bugs early. There are two main types of tests for RESTful APIs:

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation. They are fast and help ensure that each part of your application behaves correctly.

```typescript
// Example of a unit test using Jest
import { UserService } from './user.service';

describe('UserService', () => {
    let userService: UserService;

    beforeEach(() => {
        userService = new UserService();
    });

    it('should return all users', async () => {
        const users = await userService.getAllUsers();
        expect(users).toBeDefined();
        expect(users.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    });
});
```

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of your application work together as expected. They often involve testing the entire API endpoint.

```typescript
// Example of an integration test using Supertest
import request from 'supertest';
import app from './app';

describe('GET /users', () => {
    it('should return a list of users', async () => {
        const response = await request(app).get('/users');
        expect(response.status).toBe(200);
        expect(response.body).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
    });
});
```
