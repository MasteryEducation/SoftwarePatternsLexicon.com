## 10.3.3 Use Cases and Examples

Event Sourcing is a powerful design pattern that captures all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where maintaining a precise history of changes is crucial. Let's explore some practical applications of Event Sourcing, focusing on financial systems, auditing, and complex domain models.

### Financial Applications

Financial systems are prime candidates for Event Sourcing due to their need for precise transaction histories and the ability to undo operations. In these systems, every transaction, whether it's a deposit, withdrawal, or transfer, is recorded as an event. This ensures that the entire history of transactions is preserved, allowing for accurate auditing and reconciliation.

#### Example: Banking System

Consider a banking application where users can perform various transactions. By implementing Event Sourcing, each transaction is stored as an event, capturing details such as the transaction type, amount, and timestamp. This approach provides several advantages:

- **Traceability**: Every transaction is recorded, allowing for a complete audit trail.
- **Undo Capabilities**: If a transaction needs to be reversed, the system can replay events up to a certain point, effectively undoing the transaction.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial regulations often require detailed records of all transactions. Event Sourcing ensures that these records are complete and accurate.

Here's a simplified TypeScript example illustrating how Event Sourcing might be implemented in a banking application:

```typescript
interface Event {
    type: string;
    data: any;
    timestamp: Date;
}

class BankAccount {
    private balance: number = 0;
    private events: Event[] = [];

    deposit(amount: number) {
        const event: Event = { type: 'DEPOSIT', data: amount, timestamp: new Date() };
        this.apply(event);
        this.events.push(event);
    }

    withdraw(amount: number) {
        const event: Event = { type: 'WITHDRAW', data: amount, timestamp: new Date() };
        this.apply(event);
        this.events.push(event);
    }

    private apply(event: Event) {
        switch (event.type) {
            case 'DEPOSIT':
                this.balance += event.data;
                break;
            case 'WITHDRAW':
                this.balance -= event.data;
                break;
        }
    }

    getBalance(): number {
        return this.balance;
    }

    getEvents(): Event[] {
        return this.events;
    }
}

const account = new BankAccount();
account.deposit(100);
account.withdraw(50);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 50
console.log(account.getEvents());  // Output: Array of events
```

### Auditing Systems

Auditing systems benefit greatly from Event Sourcing, as they require a comprehensive record of all changes to data. By capturing each change as an event, these systems can provide detailed logs that are essential for compliance and analysis.

#### Example: User Activity Tracking

In an auditing system for tracking user activities, every action a user takes can be recorded as an event. This might include logging in, updating a profile, or making a purchase. By storing these events, the system can generate detailed reports and analyses of user behavior.

- **Detailed Logs**: Every user action is recorded, providing a complete history of interactions.
- **Compliance**: Many industries require detailed logs for compliance purposes. Event Sourcing ensures these logs are accurate and complete.
- **Behavior Analysis**: By analyzing the sequence of events, organizations can gain insights into user behavior and preferences.

Here's an example of how user activity might be tracked using Event Sourcing in TypeScript:

```typescript
interface UserEvent {
    type: string;
    userId: string;
    data: any;
    timestamp: Date;
}

class UserActivityTracker {
    private events: UserEvent[] = [];

    logEvent(event: UserEvent) {
        this.events.push(event);
    }

    getEventsForUser(userId: string): UserEvent[] {
        return this.events.filter(event => event.userId === userId);
    }
}

const tracker = new UserActivityTracker();
tracker.logEvent({ type: 'LOGIN', userId: 'user123', data: {}, timestamp: new Date() });
tracker.logEvent({ type: 'UPDATE_PROFILE', userId: 'user123', data: { name: 'John Doe' }, timestamp: new Date() });

console.log(tracker.getEventsForUser('user123')); // Output: Array of events for user123
```

### Complex Domain Models

In complex domain models, state changes are significant and need detailed tracking. Event Sourcing provides a way to capture these changes as events, allowing for a complete history of the model's evolution.

#### Example: E-commerce Order Management

In an e-commerce platform, the lifecycle of an order involves multiple state changes, from creation to fulfillment. By using Event Sourcing, each state change can be recorded as an event, providing a detailed history of the order's lifecycle.

- **State Evolution**: Track the evolution of an order through its various states.
- **Reconstruct State**: Reconstruct the current state of an order by replaying events.
- **Debugging and Analysis**: Analyze the sequence of events to identify issues or optimize processes.

Here's a TypeScript example demonstrating how Event Sourcing can be applied to order management:

```typescript
interface OrderEvent {
    type: string;
    orderId: string;
    data: any;
    timestamp: Date;
}

class Order {
    private state: string = 'CREATED';
    private events: OrderEvent[] = [];

    updateState(newState: string) {
        const event: OrderEvent = { type: 'STATE_CHANGE', orderId: this.getOrderId(), data: newState, timestamp: new Date() };
        this.apply(event);
        this.events.push(event);
    }

    private apply(event: OrderEvent) {
        if (event.type === 'STATE_CHANGE') {
            this.state = event.data;
        }
    }

    getState(): string {
        return this.state;
    }

    getEvents(): OrderEvent[] {
        return this.events;
    }

    private getOrderId(): string {
        // Logic to generate or retrieve order ID
        return 'order123';
    }
}

const order = new Order();
order.updateState('PROCESSING');
order.updateState('SHIPPED');
console.log(order.getState()); // Output: SHIPPED
console.log(order.getEvents()); // Output: Array of order events
```

### Real-World Case Studies

- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized users can view or modify events.

#### Data Integrity

- **Consistency**: Ensure that events are consistently recorded and applied to maintain the integrity of the system's state.
- **Validation**: Implement validation checks to ensure that events are correctly formatted and contain valid data.

#### Scalability

- **Event Storage**: Consider the storage requirements for events, particularly in systems with high transaction volumes.
- **Performance**: Optimize the performance of event processing and replay to ensure that the system can handle large volumes of events efficiently.

### Compliance and Regulations

Event Sourcing can facilitate compliance with regulations that require detailed data change logs. By capturing every change as an event, organizations can provide a complete audit trail that meets regulatory requirements. This is particularly important in industries such as finance, healthcare, and government, where compliance is critical.

### Encouragement for Adoption

For systems where data integrity and traceability are paramount, Event Sourcing offers a robust solution. By capturing every change as an event, organizations can ensure that their systems are accurate, auditable, and compliant with regulatory requirements. As you consider building or enhancing your systems, keep Event Sourcing in mind as a powerful tool for achieving these goals.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of Event Sourcing, try implementing a simple event-sourced application in TypeScript. Start with a basic domain model, such as a task management system, and capture each state change as an event. Experiment with replaying events to reconstruct the state and explore how this approach can enhance traceability and auditability.

### Visualizing Event Sourcing

To better understand how Event Sourcing works, let's visualize the flow of events in a system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Application
    participant EventStore
    participant State

    User->>Application: Perform Action
    Application->>EventStore: Store Event
    EventStore->>State: Update State
    State->>User: Return Updated State
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of events in an event-sourced system. A user performs an action, which is captured by the application and stored as an event in the Event Store. The state is then updated based on the event, and the updated state is returned to the user.
