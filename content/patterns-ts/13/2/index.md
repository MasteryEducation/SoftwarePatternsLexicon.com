## 13.2 Case Study: Complex Application Architecture

In this section, we delve into a comprehensive case study of a complex TypeScript application architecture that effectively utilizes multiple design patterns. This case study illustrates practical applications and the benefits achieved by combining these patterns in a real-world scenario.

### Introduction to the Case Study

#### Context of the Application

Let's explore a large-scale e-commerce platform designed to handle millions of users and transactions daily. The platform's primary purpose is to provide a seamless shopping experience, integrating features like product browsing, cart management, payment processing, and order tracking. Given the application's scale and the need for high availability, performance, and maintainability, a combination of design patterns was essential to its architecture.

#### Necessity of Combining Design Patterns

The complexity of the application required a robust architecture that could address various challenges such as scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. By leveraging multiple design patterns, the development team aimed to create a modular and extensible system that could evolve with changing business requirements and technological advancements.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Major Components and Applied Design Patterns

Let's break down the application into its major components and explore the design patterns applied to each:

1. **User Interface (UI) Layer**
   - **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: This pattern was employed to separate concerns, allowing independent development and testing of the user interface, business logic, and data access.
   - **Observer Pattern**: Used to manage real-time updates in the UI, ensuring that changes in the data model are reflected immediately.

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented to handle various pricing strategies and promotional campaigns dynamically.
   - **Command Pattern**: Utilized for encapsulating user actions, enabling features like undo/redo and action logging.

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - **Repository Pattern**: Provided a consistent interface for data access, abstracting the underlying database operations.
   - **Unit of Work Pattern**: Ensured atomic transactions, coordinating changes across multiple repositories.

4. **Communication Layer**
   - **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interactions with external services like payment gateways and shipping providers.
   - **Adapter Pattern**: Enabled integration with third-party APIs, translating their interfaces to match the application's requirements.

5. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensured a single instance of critical services like configuration management and logging.
   - **Dependency Injection Pattern**: Facilitated loose coupling and enhanced testability by injecting dependencies at runtime.

#### Interaction of Patterns

The interaction between these patterns was crucial for achieving a cohesive architecture. For instance, the MVC pattern in the UI layer worked seamlessly with the Observer pattern to provide real-time updates. Similarly, the Strategy and Command patterns in the business logic layer allowed for flexible and reversible user actions.

### Implementation Details

#### Code Excerpts and UML Diagrams

Let's explore some code excerpts and UML diagrams to visualize the architecture:

##### MVC and Observer in the UI Layer

```typescript
// Model
class ProductModel {
  private observers: Observer[] = [];
  private products: Product[] = [];

  public addObserver(observer: Observer): void {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  public notifyObservers(): void {
    for (const observer of this.observers) {
      observer.update(this);
    }
  }

  public addProduct(product: Product): void {
    this.products.push(product);
    this.notifyObservers();
  }

  public getProducts(): Product[] {
    return this.products;
  }
}

// Observer
interface Observer {
  update(model: ProductModel): void;
}

// View
class ProductView implements Observer {
  update(model: ProductModel): void {
    console.log("Products updated:", model.getProducts());
  }
}

// Controller
class ProductController {
  constructor(private model: ProductModel, private view: ProductView) {
    this.model.addObserver(this.view);
  }

  public addProduct(product: Product): void {
    this.model.addProduct(product);
  }
}
```

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ProductModel {
        +addObserver(observer: Observer): void
        +notifyObservers(): void
        +addProduct(product: Product): void
        +getProducts(): Product[]
    }
    class Observer {
        <<interface>>
        +update(model: ProductModel): void
    }
    class ProductView {
        +update(model: ProductModel): void
    }
    class ProductController {
        -model: ProductModel
        -view: ProductView
        +addProduct(product: Product): void
    }
    ProductModel --> Observer
    ProductView --> Observer
    ProductController --> ProductModel
    ProductController --> ProductView
```

##### Strategy and Command in the Business Logic Layer

```typescript
// Strategy
interface PricingStrategy {
  calculatePrice(basePrice: number): number;
}

class RegularPricing implements PricingStrategy {
  calculatePrice(basePrice: number): number {
    return basePrice;
  }
}

class DiscountPricing implements PricingStrategy {
  calculatePrice(basePrice: number): number {
    return basePrice * 0.9;
  }
}

// Command
class AddToCartCommand {
  constructor(private product: Product, private cart: Cart) {}

  execute(): void {
    this.cart.addProduct(this.product);
  }

  undo(): void {
    this.cart.removeProduct(this.product);
  }
}
```

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PricingStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +calculatePrice(basePrice: number): number
    }
    class RegularPricing {
        +calculatePrice(basePrice: number): number
    }
    class DiscountPricing {
        +calculatePrice(basePrice: number): number
    }
    class AddToCartCommand {
        -product: Product
        -cart: Cart
        +execute(): void
        +undo(): void
    }
    RegularPricing --> PricingStrategy
    DiscountPricing --> PricingStrategy
    AddToCartCommand --> Product
    AddToCartCommand --> Cart
```
