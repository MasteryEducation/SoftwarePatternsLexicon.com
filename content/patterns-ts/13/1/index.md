## 13.1 Combining Patterns Effectively

In the realm of software engineering, design patterns serve as proven solutions to recurring problems. However, as systems grow in complexity, a single pattern may not suffice. Combining multiple design patterns can create a more robust and flexible architecture. In this section, we will explore strategies for integrating multiple design patterns within a TypeScript application, ensuring that they work harmoniously to solve complex problems efficiently and elegantly.

### Introduction to Pattern Combination

Combining design patterns is akin to assembling a toolkit where each tool serves a specific purpose, yet together they can tackle a broader range of tasks. This approach is beneficial in scenarios where a single pattern cannot address all the requirements of a complex system. For instance, while the Singleton pattern ensures a single instance of a class, combining it with the Factory Method pattern can provide a controlled way of creating instances of different classes.

#### Why Combine Patterns?

- **Enhanced Flexibility**: By combining patterns, you can address more complex scenarios that a single pattern cannot handle alone.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Properly integrated patterns can lead to cleaner, more modular code, making it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Increased Reusability**: Patterns can be reused across different parts of an application, reducing redundancy and promoting consistency.

### Strategies for Integration

When integrating multiple patterns, it is crucial to select compatible patterns that complement each other. Here are some strategies to consider:

#### Methodologies for Selecting Compatible Patterns

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Begin by thoroughly understanding the problem at hand. Identify the core challenges and requirements that need addressing.
2. **Pattern Synergy**: Look for patterns that naturally complement each other. For example, the Observer pattern can be effectively combined with the Mediator pattern to manage communication between objects.
3. **Layering Patterns**: Use structural patterns to support behavioral patterns. For instance, the Adapter pattern can be used to ensure that different components can work together seamlessly, while the Strategy pattern can define the behavior of those components.

#### Ensuring Patterns Complement Each Other

- **Define Clear Boundaries**: Ensure each pattern has a well-defined role and scope within the application. This prevents overlap and potential conflicts.
- **Use Interfaces and Abstractions**: Leverage TypeScript's interfaces and abstract classes to define clear contracts between patterns, promoting loose coupling.
- **Test Interactions**: Regularly test the interactions between patterns to ensure they work as intended and do not introduce unexpected behavior.

### Interplay Between Patterns

Certain patterns naturally fit together, creating a synergistic effect that enhances the overall architecture. Let's explore some common pattern combinations:

#### Factory Method and Singleton

The Factory Method pattern can be combined with the Singleton pattern to control the instantiation of classes. The Singleton ensures that only one instance of a factory exists, while the Factory Method allows for the creation of different types of objects.

```typescript
// Singleton Factory Example
class SingletonFactory {
  private static instance: SingletonFactory;

  private constructor() {}

  public static getInstance(): SingletonFactory {
    if (!SingletonFactory.instance) {
      SingletonFactory.instance = new SingletonFactory();
    }
    return SingletonFactory.instance;
  }

  public createProduct(type: string): Product {
    switch (type) {
      case 'A':
        return new ProductA();
      case 'B':
        return new ProductB();
      default:
        throw new Error('Unknown product type');
    }
  }
}

interface Product {
  use(): void;
}

class ProductA implements Product {
  use() {
    console.log('Using Product A');
  }
}

class ProductB implements Product {
  use() {
    console.log('Using Product B');
  }
}

// Usage
const factory = SingletonFactory.getInstance();
const productA = factory.createProduct('A');
productA.use();
```

#### Observer and Mediator

The Observer pattern can be effectively combined with the Mediator pattern to manage complex interactions between objects. The Mediator acts as a central hub, coordinating communication between observers and subjects.

```typescript
// Mediator and Observer Example
interface Mediator {
  notify(sender: object, event: string): void;
}

class ConcreteMediator implements Mediator {
  private componentA: ComponentA;
  private componentB: ComponentB;

  constructor(cA: ComponentA, cB: ComponentB) {
    this.componentA = cA;
    this.componentA.setMediator(this);
    this.componentB = cB;
    this.componentB.setMediator(this);
  }

  public notify(sender: object, event: string): void {
    if (event === 'A') {
      console.log('Mediator reacts on A and triggers B');
      this.componentB.doB();
    }
    if (event === 'B') {
      console.log('Mediator reacts on B and triggers A');
      this.componentA.doA();
    }
  }
}

class BaseComponent {
  protected mediator: Mediator;

  public setMediator(mediator: Mediator): void {
    this.mediator = mediator;
  }
}

class ComponentA extends BaseComponent {
  public doA(): void {
    console.log('Component A does A');
    this.mediator.notify(this, 'A');
  }
}

class ComponentB extends BaseComponent {
  public doB(): void {
    console.log('Component B does B');
    this.mediator.notify(this, 'B');
  }
}

// Usage
const componentA = new ComponentA();
const componentB = new ComponentB();
const mediator = new ConcreteMediator(componentA, componentB);

componentA.doA();
componentB.doB();
```

### TypeScript-Specific Considerations

TypeScript offers several features that facilitate the combination of design patterns, such as interfaces, generics, and decorators.

#### Interfaces and Generics

- **Interfaces**: Use interfaces to define contracts between patterns, ensuring that components adhere to expected behaviors.
- **Generics**: Leverage generics to create flexible and reusable components that can work with various data types.

```typescript
// Generic Repository Pattern
interface Repository<T> {
  getById(id: number): T;
  getAll(): T[];
}

class UserRepository implements Repository<User> {
  private users: User[] = [];

  getById(id: number): User {
    return this.users.find(user => user.id === id);
  }

  getAll(): User[] {
    return this.users;
  }
}

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

#### Decorators

Decorators can be used to enhance or modify the behavior of classes and methods, making them a powerful tool for pattern integration.

```typescript
// Logging Decorator Example
function Log(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${propertyKey} with arguments: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
  return descriptor;
}

class Calculator {
  @Log
  add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
}

// Usage
const calculator = new Calculator();
console.log(calculator.add(2, 3));
```

### Best Practices

Combining multiple design patterns can lead to complex architectures. Here are some best practices to maintain readability and manageability:

- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid overcomplicating the design. Use patterns only when they add clear value.
- **Document Patterns**: Clearly document the patterns used and their interactions to aid future maintenance.
- **Regular Refactoring**: Continuously refactor the codebase to ensure patterns remain relevant and effective.
- **Encapsulate Complexity**: Hide complex interactions behind well-defined interfaces or classes.

### Warning Against Overuse

While combining patterns can be powerful, it is essential to avoid unnecessary complexity. Consider the following:

- **Assess Value**: Before combining patterns, assess whether the combination adds real value to the application.
- **Avoid Pattern Overload**: Too many patterns can lead to a convoluted design that is difficult to understand and maintain.

### Summary

Combining design patterns effectively requires a deep understanding of both the individual patterns and their interactions. By carefully selecting and integrating patterns, we can create flexible, maintainable, and efficient TypeScript applications. Remember to keep the design simple, document your patterns, and continuously evaluate their effectiveness.
