## 5.1.3 Use Cases and Examples

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It's akin to a power adapter that lets you plug a device into a socket with a different shape. In software development, this pattern is invaluable when integrating systems that were not designed to cooperate. Let's delve into some real-world scenarios where the Adapter Pattern shines, particularly in TypeScript.

### Integrating a New Payment Gateway API

**Scenario:** Imagine you are working on an e-commerce platform that has been using a specific payment gateway for years. The platform's payment processing module expects a particular interface to handle transactions. Now, you need to integrate a new payment gateway that offers better rates and features but has a different API.

**Solution with Adapter Pattern:** You can create an adapter that implements the expected interface and internally uses the new payment gateway's API. This way, the rest of the system can continue to operate without any changes.

#### Code Example

```typescript
// Existing interface expected by the e-commerce platform
interface PaymentProcessor {
    processPayment(amount: number): void;
}

// New payment gateway with a different interface
class NewPaymentGateway {
    makePayment(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount} through the new gateway.`);
    }
}

// Adapter class implementing the expected interface
class PaymentGatewayAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private newGateway: NewPaymentGateway;

    constructor(newGateway: NewPaymentGateway) {
        this.newGateway = newGateway;
    }

    processPayment(amount: number): void {
        this.newGateway.makePayment(amount);
    }
}

// Usage
const newGateway = new NewPaymentGateway();
const adapter = new PaymentGatewayAdapter(newGateway);
adapter.processPayment(100);
```

**Benefits:**
- **Reuse of Existing Code:** The existing payment processing logic remains unchanged.
- **Loose Coupling:** The adapter decouples the e-commerce platform from the new payment gateway.
- **Facilitates Gradual Integration:** Allows for a seamless transition to the new gateway.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Added Complexity:** Introduces an additional layer of abstraction.
- **Performance Overhead:** Slightly more processing due to the adapter layer.

### Adapting a Logging Library's Interface

**Scenario:** Your application has a custom logging infrastructure, but you want to leverage a third-party logging library that offers advanced features like log rotation and remote logging. However, the library's interface is different from your application's logging interface.

**Solution with Adapter Pattern:** Implement an adapter that translates your application's logging calls into the third-party library's API.

#### Code Example

```typescript
// Application's logging interface
interface Logger {
    log(message: string): void;
}

// Third-party logging library
class ThirdPartyLogger {
    writeLog(msg: string): void {
        console.log(`Third-party log: ${msg}`);
    }
}

// Adapter class
class LoggerAdapter implements Logger {
    private thirdPartyLogger: ThirdPartyLogger;

    constructor(thirdPartyLogger: ThirdPartyLogger) {
        this.thirdPartyLogger = thirdPartyLogger;
    }

    log(message: string): void {
        this.thirdPartyLogger.writeLog(message);
    }
}

// Usage
const thirdPartyLogger = new ThirdPartyLogger();
const loggerAdapter = new LoggerAdapter(thirdPartyLogger);
loggerAdapter.log("This is a log message.");
```

**Benefits:**
- **Integration of Advanced Features:** Leverage the third-party library's capabilities without altering your logging infrastructure.
- **Loose Coupling:** The adapter isolates the application from the third-party library.
- **Gradual Replacement:** Allows for testing and gradual adoption of the new logging system.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Complexity:** Adds another layer to the logging process.
- **Potential for Bugs:** Misalignment between the adapter and the library's API can introduce bugs.

### Using an External Data Source with a Different Data Format

**Scenario:** Your application processes data in a specific format, but you need to integrate an external data source that provides data in a different format. Directly modifying your application to accommodate the new format would be costly and error-prone.

**Solution with Adapter Pattern:** Create an adapter that converts the external data format into the format expected by your application.

#### Code Example

```typescript
// Expected data format
interface DataModel {
    id: number;
    name: string;
}

// External data source format
class ExternalData {
    getData(): { identifier: number; fullName: string } {
        return { identifier: 1, fullName: "John Doe" };
    }
}

// Adapter class
class DataAdapter implements DataModel {
    private externalData: ExternalData;

    constructor(externalData: ExternalData) {
        this.externalData = externalData;
    }

    get id(): number {
        return this.externalData.getData().identifier;
    }

    get name(): string {
        return this.externalData.getData().fullName;
    }
}

// Usage
const externalData = new ExternalData();
const adaptedData: DataModel = new DataAdapter(externalData);
console.log(`ID: ${adaptedData.id}, Name: ${adaptedData.name}`);
```

**Benefits:**
- **Data Format Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates the external data source without altering the core application.
- **Loose Coupling:** The adapter acts as a bridge, maintaining separation between the application and the data source.
- **Flexibility:** Easily switch to different data sources by implementing new adapters.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Performance Overhead:** Data conversion might introduce latency.
- **Complexity:** Managing multiple adapters can become cumbersome.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

To better understand how the Adapter Pattern works, let's visualize the relationships between the components involved.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentProcessor {
        <<interface>>
        processPayment(amount: number): void
    }
    class NewPaymentGateway {
        makePayment(amount: number): void
    }
    class PaymentGatewayAdapter {
        -NewPaymentGateway newGateway
        processPayment(amount: number): void
    }
    PaymentProcessor <|.. PaymentGatewayAdapter
    PaymentGatewayAdapter --> NewPaymentGateway
```

**Diagram Description:** This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `PaymentProcessor` interface, the `NewPaymentGateway` class, and the `PaymentGatewayAdapter`. The adapter implements the `PaymentProcessor` interface and delegates the payment processing to the `NewPaymentGateway`.

### Encouragement to Use the Adapter Pattern

When faced with integration challenges, consider the Adapter Pattern as a viable solution. It allows you to bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces without modifying existing code, promoting code reuse and flexibility. However, be mindful of the added complexity and potential performance implications.

### Try It Yourself
