## 5.9.2 Adding Functionality at Runtime

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the need to adapt and extend applications dynamically is paramount. The Extension Object Pattern is a powerful tool that allows developers to add functionality to objects at runtime without altering their class definitions. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the application needs to be flexible and adaptable to changing requirements or configurations.

### Understanding the Extension Object Pattern

The Extension Object Pattern is a structural design pattern that enables the addition of new functionalities to objects without modifying their existing structure. This is achieved by attaching extension objects that encapsulate the additional behavior or properties. This pattern is akin to the Decorator Pattern but focuses more on adding new interfaces to objects rather than just enhancing existing ones.

#### Key Concepts

- **Dynamic Extension**: The ability to add new capabilities to objects during runtime based on specific conditions or configurations.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By using extension objects, the core functionality of an object remains untouched, promoting clean separation between the base object and its extensions.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Allows applications to be more flexible and adaptable to changes without requiring a complete overhaul of existing code.

### Scenarios for Runtime Functionality Addition

There are several scenarios where adding functionality at runtime is beneficial:

1. **Plugin Systems**: Applications like IDEs or content management systems often support plugins that can add new features or tools.
2. **Feature Toggles**: Enabling or disabling features based on user preferences or configuration settings.
3. **Conditional Logic**: Executing different logic paths based on runtime conditions, such as user roles or environmental variables.

### Implementing the Extension Object Pattern in TypeScript

Let's delve into how we can implement the Extension Object Pattern in TypeScript to add functionality at runtime.

#### Step 1: Define the Core Object

First, we define a core object that represents the base functionality. This object will be extended with additional features.

```typescript
class CoreObject {
  public name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public describe(): string {
    return `This is a core object named ${this.name}.`;
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create an Extension Interface

Next, we define an interface for the extensions. This interface will specify the methods that extension objects must implement.

```typescript
interface Extension {
  extend(core: CoreObject): void;
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement Extension Objects

Now, we create extension objects that implement the `Extension` interface. These objects will add new functionality to the core object.

```typescript
class LoggingExtension implements Extension {
  public extend(core: CoreObject): void {
    core['log'] = function(message: string): void {
      console.log(`[${this.name}] ${message}`);
    };
  }
}

class TimestampExtension implements Extension {
  public extend(core: CoreObject): void {
    core['timestamp'] = function(): string {
      return new Date().toISOString();
    };
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Extend the Core Object at Runtime

Finally, we can extend the core object at runtime by applying the desired extensions.

```typescript
const core = new CoreObject('MyCoreObject');

const loggingExtension = new LoggingExtension();
const timestampExtension = new TimestampExtension();

loggingExtension.extend(core);
timestampExtension.extend(core);

// Now the core object has additional methods
(core as any).log('This is a log message.');
console.log(`Current timestamp: ${(core as any).timestamp()}`);
```

### Benefits of Using the Extension Object Pattern

The Extension Object Pattern offers several benefits:

- **Modularity**: Extensions are modular and can be added or removed without affecting the core object.
- **Scalability**: New features can be added as separate extensions, making the system scalable.
- **Maintainability**: By keeping extensions separate, the core codebase remains clean and maintainable.

### Visualizing the Extension Object Pattern

To better understand how the Extension Object Pattern works, let's visualize the relationship between the core object and its extensions.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CoreObject {
        +name: string
        +describe(): string
    }

    class Extension {
        <<interface>>
        +extend(core: CoreObject): void
    }

    class LoggingExtension {
        +extend(core: CoreObject): void
    }

    class TimestampExtension {
        +extend(core: CoreObject): void
    }

    CoreObject <|-- LoggingExtension
    CoreObject <|-- TimestampExtension
    Extension <|.. LoggingExtension
    Extension <|.. TimestampExtension
```

In this diagram, `CoreObject` is the base class, and `LoggingExtension` and `TimestampExtension` are extensions that implement the `Extension` interface. These extensions add new methods to the `CoreObject` at runtime.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided by:

- Adding a new extension that provides additional functionality, such as a method to format the object's name.
- Modifying the `CoreObject` class to include a method that lists all available extensions.
- Implementing a mechanism to remove extensions from the core object.

### Knowledge Check

To reinforce your understanding of the Extension Object Pattern, consider the following questions:

- How does the Extension Object Pattern differ from the Decorator Pattern?
- What are some potential drawbacks of dynamically adding functionality to objects?
- How can you ensure that extensions do not conflict with each other?
