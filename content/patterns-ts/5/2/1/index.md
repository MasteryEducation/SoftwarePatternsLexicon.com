## 5.2.1 Implementing Bridge in TypeScript

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to switch between different implementations at runtime without altering the client code. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Bridge Pattern in TypeScript, leveraging its strong typing and interface capabilities.

### Understanding the Bridge Pattern

The Bridge Pattern involves four main components:

1. **Abstraction**: Defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor.
2. **Implementor**: Declares the interface for implementation classes.
3. **Concrete Implementor**: Provides concrete implementations of the Implementor interface.
4. **Refined Abstraction**: Extends the interface defined by Abstraction.

By separating the abstraction from the implementation, the Bridge Pattern allows you to change the implementation without modifying the abstraction or the client code.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's walk through a step-by-step implementation of the Bridge Pattern in TypeScript.

#### Step 1: Define the Implementor Interface

The Implementor interface declares the methods that concrete implementors must provide. This interface acts as a bridge between the abstraction and the concrete implementations.

```typescript
// Implementor interface
interface DrawingAPI {
    drawCircle(x: number, y: number, radius: number): void;
}
```

In this example, the `DrawingAPI` interface declares a method `drawCircle`, which concrete implementors will define.

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Implementor Classes

Concrete Implementor classes provide specific implementations of the methods declared in the Implementor interface.

```typescript
// Concrete Implementor 1
class DrawingAPI1 implements DrawingAPI {
    drawCircle(x: number, y: number, radius: number): void {
        console.log(`API1.circle at (${x}, ${y}) with radius ${radius}`);
    }
}

// Concrete Implementor 2
class DrawingAPI2 implements DrawingAPI {
    drawCircle(x: number, y: number, radius: number): void {
        console.log(`API2.circle at (${x}, ${y}) with radius ${radius}`);
    }
}
```

Here, `DrawingAPI1` and `DrawingAPI2` are two different implementations of the `DrawingAPI` interface.

#### Step 3: Define the Abstraction

The Abstraction class maintains a reference to an Implementor object and delegates the actual work to the Implementor.

```typescript
// Abstraction
abstract class Shape {
    protected drawingAPI: DrawingAPI;

    constructor(drawingAPI: DrawingAPI) {
        this.drawingAPI = drawingAPI;
    }

    abstract draw(): void;
    abstract resizeByPercentage(pct: number): void;
}
```

The `Shape` class is an abstract class that holds a reference to a `DrawingAPI` object. It provides abstract methods `draw` and `resizeByPercentage` that must be implemented by subclasses.

#### Step 4: Create Refined Abstraction Classes

Refined Abstraction classes extend the interface defined by the Abstraction class.

```typescript
// Refined Abstraction
class CircleShape extends Shape {
    private x: number;
    private y: number;
    private radius: number;

    constructor(x: number, y: number, radius: number, drawingAPI: DrawingAPI) {
        super(drawingAPI);
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    draw(): void {
        this.drawingAPI.drawCircle(this.x, this.y, this.radius);
    }

    resizeByPercentage(pct: number): void {
        this.radius *= pct;
    }
}
```

The `CircleShape` class extends the `Shape` class and provides implementations for the `draw` and `resizeByPercentage` methods.

#### Step 5: Use the Bridge Pattern in Client Code

Now, let's see how to use the Bridge Pattern in client code to switch implementations at runtime.

```typescript
// Client code
const shapes: Shape[] = [
    new CircleShape(1, 2, 3, new DrawingAPI1()),
    new CircleShape(5, 7, 11, new DrawingAPI2())
];

shapes.forEach(shape => {
    shape.resizeByPercentage(2.5);
    shape.draw();
});
```

In the client code, we create an array of `Shape` objects, each using a different `DrawingAPI` implementation. We then iterate over the array, resizing and drawing each shape.

### TypeScript-Specific Considerations

TypeScript's strong typing and interface capabilities make it an excellent choice for implementing the Bridge Pattern. Here are some considerations:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures that the methods declared in the Implementor interface are implemented by concrete classes, providing compile-time type safety.
- **Access Modifiers**: Use access modifiers like `protected` to control access to the Implementor reference within the Abstraction class.
- **Constructor Injection**: Inject the Implementor into the Abstraction through constructor injection, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.

### Visualizing the Bridge Pattern

To better understand the Bridge Pattern, let's visualize the relationships between the components using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DrawingAPI {
        <<interface>>
        +drawCircle(x: number, y: number, radius: number): void
    }

    class DrawingAPI1 {
        +drawCircle(x: number, y: number, radius: number): void
    }

    class DrawingAPI2 {
        +drawCircle(x: number, y: number, radius: number): void
    }

    class Shape {
        #drawingAPI: DrawingAPI
        +Shape(drawingAPI: DrawingAPI)
        +draw(): void
        +resizeByPercentage(pct: number): void
    }

    class CircleShape {
        +CircleShape(x: number, y: number, radius: number, drawingAPI: DrawingAPI)
        +draw(): void
        +resizeByPercentage(pct: number): void
    }

    DrawingAPI <|.. DrawingAPI1
    DrawingAPI <|.. DrawingAPI2
    Shape <|-- CircleShape
    Shape --> DrawingAPI
```

This diagram illustrates the relationships between the `DrawingAPI`, `DrawingAPI1`, `DrawingAPI2`, `Shape`, and `CircleShape` classes.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the implementation of the Bridge Pattern in TypeScript, try modifying the code to add a new shape, such as a rectangle. Implement a new `RectangleShape` class that extends the `Shape` class and provides its own implementations for the `draw` and `resizeByPercentage` methods. Experiment with different `DrawingAPI` implementations and see how easily you can switch between them.
