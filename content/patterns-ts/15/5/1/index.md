## 15.5.1 Authorization and Authentication Patterns

In today's digital landscape, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access certain functionalities or data is paramount. This section delves into the patterns related to implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms in TypeScript applications. Let's explore the key concepts, common patterns, implementation strategies, and best practices to secure your applications effectively.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Before diving into patterns, it's crucial to distinguish between authentication and authorization:

- **Authentication**: This is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?" Common methods include passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- **Authorization**: Once identity is verified, authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What can you do?" This involves granting permissions to access resources or perform actions.

### Common Patterns in Authentication and Authorization

Several patterns are commonly used to manage authentication and authorization:

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is a widely used pattern where permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to these roles. This simplifies management by allowing administrators to control access at the role level rather than the individual user level.

#### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ACLs provide a more granular level of control by specifying which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.

#### Security Tokens

Security tokens are used to authenticate and authorize users without requiring them to re-enter credentials. Tokens can be short-lived (like JWTs) or long-lived, depending on the security requirements.

### Implementing Authentication and Authorization in TypeScript

Let's explore how to implement these patterns in TypeScript using various techniques and libraries.

#### Using Middleware for Authentication

Middleware functions in frameworks like Express.js can intercept requests and check for authentication before proceeding. Here's an example of a simple authentication middleware in TypeScript:

```typescript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

// Middleware to check if the user is authenticated
function isAuthenticated(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
    }
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
}

export default isAuthenticated;
```

#### Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC can be implemented using a combination of middleware and services. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Role {
    name: string;
    permissions: string[];
}

const roles: Role[] = [
    { name: 'admin', permissions: ['read', 'write', 'delete'] },
    { name: 'user', permissions: ['read'] },
];

// Middleware to check if the user has a specific role
function hasRole(roleName: string) {
    return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
        const userRole = req.user.role;
        const role = roles.find(r => r.name === userRole);
        if (role && role.permissions.includes(roleName)) {
            return next();
        }
        res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
    };
}

export { hasRole };
```

#### Using Decorators for Authorization

TypeScript decorators can be used to add authorization checks to methods. Here's an example using a custom decorator:

```typescript
function Authorize(roles: string[]) {
    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
        const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
        descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
            const req = args[0]; // Assuming the first argument is the request object
            const userRole = req.user.role;
            if (roles.includes(userRole)) {
                return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
            }
            throw new Error('Unauthorized');
        };
    };
}

class UserService {
    @Authorize(['admin'])
    deleteUser(req: Request, res: Response) {
        // Delete user logic
    }
}
```

### Security Considerations

While implementing authentication and authorization, it's vital to be aware of common vulnerabilities and strategies to mitigate them:

#### Common Vulnerabilities

- **Injection Attacks**: Ensure that all inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
- **Insecure Token Storage**: Store tokens securely, preferably using HTTP-only cookies or secure storage mechanisms.
- **Session Hijacking**: Use secure cookies and implement session expiration to prevent hijacking.

#### Mitigation Strategies

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs.
- **Secure Storage**: Use secure methods to store sensitive data, such as tokens and passwords.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted using HTTPS.

### Integration with Frameworks

Frameworks like Express.js provide robust support for authentication and authorization. Libraries like Passport.js simplify the process of integrating various authentication strategies.

#### Using Passport.js with Express.js

Passport.js is a popular library for authentication in Node.js applications. Here's how you can use it with TypeScript:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import passport from 'passport';
import { Strategy as LocalStrategy } from 'passport-local';

passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
    function (username, password, done) {
        // Authentication logic here
        if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
            return done(null, { username: 'admin' });
        }
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect credentials' });
    }
));

const app = express();

app.use(passport.initialize());

app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', {
    successRedirect: '/dashboard',
    failureRedirect: '/login',
    failureFlash: true
}));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### Best Practices

To ensure robust security, adhere to the following best practices:

- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Always encrypt sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted.
- **Session Management**: Implement proper session management, including expiration and invalidation.
- **Adhere to Standards**: Use standards like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization.

### Conclusion

Robust authentication and authorization are critical for securing applications. By implementing patterns like RBAC, ACLs, and using security tokens, you can effectively manage user access. Always be mindful of security considerations and adhere to best practices to protect your applications from vulnerabilities.
