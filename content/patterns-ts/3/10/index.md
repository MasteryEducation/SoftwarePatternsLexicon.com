## 3.10 Type Guards and Type Predicates

In TypeScript, type safety is a cornerstone of writing robust and maintainable code. Type guards and type predicates are powerful tools that enhance this safety by allowing developers to perform runtime type checking and inform the TypeScript compiler about type information. This section delves into these concepts, providing expert insights and practical examples to harness their full potential.

### Understanding Type Guards

Type guards are expressions that perform runtime checks to ensure a variable is of a specific type. They help TypeScript's compiler refine the type of a variable within a block of code, allowing for more precise type inference and reducing the risk of runtime errors.

#### Built-in Type Guards

TypeScript provides several built-in type guards, including `typeof`, `instanceof`, and property existence checks. Let's explore each of these with examples:

- **`typeof` Operator**: Used to check primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.

```typescript
function isString(value: any): boolean {
  return typeof value === 'string';
}

const input: any = "Hello, TypeScript!";
if (isString(input)) {
  console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // Safe to use string methods
}
```

- **`instanceof` Operator**: Used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class.

```typescript
class Dog {
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

const pet: any = new Dog();
if (pet instanceof Dog) {
  pet.bark(); // Safe to call bark method
}
```

- **Property Existence Checks**: Used to check if an object has a specific property.

```typescript
interface Bird {
  fly(): void;
}

function isBird(obj: any): obj is Bird {
  return 'fly' in obj;
}

const creature: any = { fly: () => console.log("Flying!") };
if (isBird(creature)) {
  creature.fly(); // Safe to call fly method
}
```

### Custom Type Guards with Type Predicates

Custom type guards allow developers to define their own logic for type checking using type predicates. A type predicate is a return type in the form `parameterName is Type`, which tells the TypeScript compiler about the type of a variable within a conditional block.

#### Writing Custom Type Guard Functions

Let's create a custom type guard function to determine if a variable is an array of numbers:

```typescript
function isNumberArray(value: any): value is number[] {
  return Array.isArray(value) && value.every(item => typeof item === 'number');
}

const data: any = [1, 2, 3];
if (isNumberArray(data)) {
  console.log(data.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0)); // Safe to use array methods
}
```

In this example, the `isNumberArray` function checks if `value` is an array and if every element is a number. If both conditions are met, it returns `true`, and the compiler knows that `data` is a `number[]` within the `if` block.

### Enhancing Type Safety with Type Guards

Type guards significantly improve type safety by narrowing down types within conditional blocks. This helps prevent runtime errors and allows the TypeScript compiler to provide better type inference and code suggestions.

#### Discriminated Unions and Type Guards

Discriminated unions are a powerful feature in TypeScript that work seamlessly with type guards. They allow you to define a union of types with a common discriminant property, enabling the compiler to narrow down the type based on the value of this property.

```typescript
interface Square {
  kind: 'square';
  size: number;
}

interface Rectangle {
  kind: 'rectangle';
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'square':
      return shape.size * shape.size;
    case 'rectangle':
      return shape.width * shape.height;
  }
}

const myShape: Shape = { kind: 'square', size: 5 };
console.log(getArea(myShape)); // Outputs: 25
```

In this example, the `kind` property acts as a discriminant, allowing the `getArea` function to determine the exact type of `shape` and access the appropriate properties.

### Best Practices for Type Guards

To keep your code maintainable and efficient, consider the following best practices when working with type guards:

- **Organize Type Guards**: Group related type guards together, possibly in a utility module, to keep your codebase organized and reusable.
- **Minimize Performance Impact**: Be mindful of the performance impact of runtime checks, especially in performance-critical applications. Use type guards judiciously.
- **Leverage Type Inference**: Allow the TypeScript compiler to infer types whenever possible, using type guards to refine types only when necessary.

### Advanced Use Cases

Type guards can be used in advanced scenarios, such as higher-order functions or complex type hierarchies. Let's explore an example involving a higher-order function:

```typescript
type Validator<T> = (value: any) => value is T;

function validate<T>(value: any, validator: Validator<T>): T | null {
  return validator(value) ? value : null;
}

const isStringValidator: Validator<string> = (value): value is string => typeof value === 'string';

const result = validate("Hello", isStringValidator);
if (result !== null) {
  console.log(result.toUpperCase()); // Safe to use string methods
}
```

In this example, the `validate` function takes a value and a validator function, returning the value if it passes the validation or `null` otherwise. This pattern can be extended to create flexible and reusable validation logic.

### Type Guards in Error Handling and Data Validation

Type guards play a crucial role in error handling and data validation by ensuring that data conforms to expected types before processing. This reduces the risk of runtime errors and improves the robustness of your applications.

### Interplay with Generics and Advanced Types

Type guards can be combined with generics and advanced types to create highly flexible and type-safe code. For instance, you can use type guards to refine generic types based on runtime conditions, enabling more precise type inference and reducing the need for type assertions.

### Conclusion

Type guards and type predicates are essential tools in TypeScript for enhancing type safety and enabling precise type inference. By understanding and leveraging these concepts, you can write more robust, maintainable, and error-free code. Remember to use type guards judiciously, keeping performance considerations in mind, and organize them effectively to maintain a clean and efficient codebase.
