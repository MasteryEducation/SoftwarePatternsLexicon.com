## 19.1 Glossary of Terms

Welcome to the Glossary of Terms for "Design Patterns in TypeScript for Expert Software Engineers." This section provides clear and concise definitions of key terminology used throughout the guide. Whether you're revisiting a concept or encountering it for the first time, this glossary serves as a reliable reference tool to aid your understanding and application of design patterns in TypeScript.

### A

**Abstract Factory Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is often used when a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created.  
*See also: Factory Method Pattern, Creational Patterns.*

**Asynchronous Programming**  
A programming paradigm that allows for the execution of operations without blocking the main thread, enabling the handling of tasks such as I/O operations concurrently. In TypeScript, this is often achieved using Promises, async/await, and Observables.  
*See also: Promises, Async/Await, Observables.*

**Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**  
A programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or security. It involves breaking down a program into distinct parts called aspects.  
*See also: Cross-Cutting Concerns.*

### B

**Behavioral Patterns**  
Design patterns that focus on how classes and objects interact and communicate with each other. They help define the responsibilities of objects and the ways they interact. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.  
*See also: Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Command Pattern.*

**Builder Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is useful for creating objects with many optional parameters.  
*See also: Creational Patterns, Fluent Interfaces.*

### C

**Chain of Responsibility Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.  
*See also: Behavioral Patterns, Middleware.*

**Class**  
In TypeScript, a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. Classes support inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  
*See also: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism.*

**Creational Patterns**  
Design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.  
*See also: Singleton Pattern, Factory Method Pattern, Builder Pattern.*

### D

**Decorator Pattern**  
A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In TypeScript, decorators can be used to modify classes and methods.  
*See also: Structural Patterns, TypeScript Decorators.*

**Dependency Injection (DI)**  
A design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling and enhances testability.  
*See also: Inversion of Control, IoC Containers.*

**Design Patterns**  
Reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns can be categorized into creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.  
*See also: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, Behavioral Patterns.*

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**  
A principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization. It promotes the reuse of code and reduces redundancy.  
*See also: KISS, YAGNI.*

### E

**Encapsulation**  
A fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that restricts access to certain components of an object and can prevent the accidental modification of data. It is achieved using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public` in TypeScript.  
*See also: Object-Oriented Programming, Access Modifiers.*

**Event-Driven Architecture**  
A software architecture pattern promoting the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. It is commonly used in systems that require asynchronous communication.  
*See also: Asynchronous Programming, Event Sourcing.*

### F

**Factory Method Pattern**  
A creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.  
*See also: Abstract Factory Pattern, Creational Patterns.*

A design principle in which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. It is often used in conjunction with Dependency Injection.  
*See also: Dependency Injection, IoC Containers.*

**Iterator Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.  
*See also: Behavioral Patterns, Iterable Protocol.*

*See also: Modules, Code Organization.*

### O

**Observer Pattern**  
A behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.  
*See also: Behavioral Patterns, Event Handling.*
