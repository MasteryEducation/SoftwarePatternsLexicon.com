## 4.9 Multiton Pattern

In the world of software design patterns, the **Multiton Pattern** stands out as a powerful extension of the Singleton Pattern. While the Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, the Multiton Pattern allows for the controlled creation of multiple instances, each identified by a unique key. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a fixed number of instances are required, and each instance must be distinguished by a key.

### Understanding the Multiton Pattern

The Multiton Pattern is a creational design pattern that manages a map of named instances. Unlike the Singleton Pattern, which restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, the Multiton Pattern allows for multiple instances, each associated with a unique key. This pattern ensures that a class maintains a collection of instances, each accessible through a key.

#### Key Differences from the Singleton Pattern

- **Multiple Instances**: While the Singleton Pattern restricts a class to a single instance, the Multiton Pattern allows for multiple instances, each identified by a key.
- **Keyed Access**: Instances in the Multiton Pattern are accessed using keys, providing a way to manage multiple instances efficiently.
- **Centralized Management**: The Multiton Pattern centralizes the management of instances, ensuring that each key corresponds to a unique instance.

### Problem Solved by the Multiton Pattern

The Multiton Pattern addresses the need for managing a fixed number of instances that are distinguished by keys. This is particularly useful in scenarios where:

- **Resource Management**: You need to manage a pool of resources, such as database connections or configuration settings, where each resource is identified by a key.
- **Configuration Management**: Different configurations are required for different parts of an application, and each configuration is accessed using a key.
- **State Management**: Different states or contexts are managed within an application, each identified by a unique key.

### Key Characteristics of the Multiton Pattern

- **Centralized Instance Management**: The Multiton Pattern centralizes the management of instances, ensuring that each key corresponds to a unique instance.
- **Keyed Access**: Instances are accessed using keys, providing a way to manage multiple instances efficiently.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Instances are created only when they are needed, optimizing resource usage.

### Implementing the Multiton Pattern in TypeScript

Let's dive into the implementation of the Multiton Pattern in TypeScript. We'll start by defining a class that manages a collection of instances, each identified by a key.

```typescript
class Multiton {
  private static instances: Map<string, Multiton> = new Map();

  private constructor(private key: string) {}

  public static getInstance(key: string): Multiton {
    if (!Multiton.instances.has(key)) {
      Multiton.instances.set(key, new Multiton(key));
    }
    return Multiton.instances.get(key)!;
  }

  public getKey(): string {
    return this.key;
  }
}

// Usage
const instanceA = Multiton.getInstance('A');
const instanceB = Multiton.getInstance('B');
const anotherInstanceA = Multiton.getInstance('A');

console.log(instanceA === anotherInstanceA); // true
console.log(instanceA === instanceB); // false
```

#### Explanation of the Code

- **Private Constructor**: The constructor is private to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class.
- **Static Map**: A static map (`instances`) is used to store instances, with keys as identifiers.
- **getInstance Method**: This static method checks if an instance with the given key exists. If not, it creates a new instance and stores it in the map.
- **Keyed Access**: Instances are accessed using the `getInstance` method with a key, ensuring that each key corresponds to a unique instance.

### Visualizing the Multiton Pattern

To better understand the Multiton Pattern, let's visualize the relationship between keys and instances using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Multiton {
        - Map~string, Multiton~ instances
        - string key
        + getInstance(key: string): Multiton
        + getKey(): string
    }
    Multiton --> "1" Map : manages
    Multiton --> "1" string : key
```

#### Diagram Explanation

- **Multiton Class**: Represents the class that manages instances.
- **Map**: A collection that stores instances, with keys as identifiers.
- **getInstance Method**: Provides access to instances using keys.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored the Multiton Pattern, try modifying the code example to add additional functionality. For instance, you could:

- **Add a Method**: Implement a method to remove an instance by its key.
- **Track Instance Count**: Add functionality to track the number of instances created.

### Summary

The Multiton Pattern is a powerful extension of the Singleton Pattern, allowing for the controlled creation of multiple instances, each identified by a key. By centralizing instance management and providing keyed access, the Multiton Pattern addresses the need for managing a fixed number of instances efficiently. As you continue your journey in software design, consider how the Multiton Pattern can be applied to solve complex problems in your applications.
