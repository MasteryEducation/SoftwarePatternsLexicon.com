## 4.5.1 Implementing Prototype in TypeScript

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new instance of a class is more expensive than copying an existing instance. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Prototype Pattern in TypeScript, leveraging object cloning techniques and the spread operator.

### Understanding the Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is based on the concept of cloning. Instead of instantiating a new object directly, you clone an existing object. This approach can be beneficial in scenarios where object creation is costly, or when you want to avoid the complexities of constructors.

#### Key Concepts

- **Prototype Interface**: Defines a method for cloning itself.
- **Concrete Prototype**: Implements the cloning method to create a copy of itself.
- **Client**: Uses the prototype to create new objects.

### Implementing the Prototype Interface

Let's start by defining a `Prototype` interface with a `clone` method. This method will be responsible for creating a copy of the object.

```typescript
interface Prototype {
  clone(): Prototype;
}
```

The `clone` method returns a new instance of the `Prototype`. This interface will be implemented by concrete classes that need to provide their own cloning logic.

### Creating Concrete Prototype Classes

Concrete prototypes are classes that implement the `Prototype` interface. Each concrete prototype must provide its own implementation of the `clone` method.

```typescript
class ConcretePrototype1 implements Prototype {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}

  clone(): Prototype {
    return new ConcretePrototype1(this.name, this.age);
  }
}

class ConcretePrototype2 implements Prototype {
  constructor(public title: string, public description: string) {}

  clone(): Prototype {
    return new ConcretePrototype2(this.title, this.description);
  }
}
```

In these examples, `ConcretePrototype1` and `ConcretePrototype2` each implement the `clone` method, which returns a new instance of the respective class with the same properties.

### Using TypeScript's Object Spread Syntax for Shallow Copies

TypeScript provides a convenient way to create shallow copies of objects using the spread operator `{ ...obj }`. This operator copies all enumerable properties from the source object to a new object.

```typescript
class ShallowCopyPrototype implements Prototype {
  constructor(public data: { [key: string]: any }) {}

  clone(): Prototype {
    return new ShallowCopyPrototype({ ...this.data });
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ShallowCopyPrototype` class uses the spread operator to create a shallow copy of its `data` property. This is suitable for objects with primitive types or flat structures.

### Handling Nested Properties and Methods

When dealing with objects that have nested properties or methods, a shallow copy may not suffice. In such cases, you need to implement custom cloning logic to ensure that nested objects are also cloned.

```typescript
class DeepCopyPrototype implements Prototype {
  constructor(public data: { [key: string]: any }) {}

  clone(): Prototype {
    const clonedData = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.data));
    return new DeepCopyPrototype(clonedData);
  }
}
```

Here, we use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.data))` to create a deep copy of the `data` object. This approach works well for simple objects but may not handle functions or non-serializable properties.

### Custom Cloning Logic for Complex Objects

For complex objects that contain methods, functions, or non-serializable properties, you need to implement custom cloning logic. This involves manually copying each property and ensuring that methods are correctly bound.

```typescript
class ComplexPrototype implements Prototype {
  constructor(public data: { [key: string]: any }, public method: () => void) {}

  clone(): Prototype {
    const clonedData = { ...this.data };
    const clonedMethod = this.method.bind(this);
    return new ComplexPrototype(clonedData, clonedMethod);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ComplexPrototype` class manually clones its `data` property and binds its `method` to ensure that the cloned object behaves as expected.

### TypeScript-Specific Features and Considerations

TypeScript offers several features that can aid in implementing the Prototype Pattern:

- **Utility Types**: Use utility types like `Readonly` to create immutable clones.
- **Type Guards**: Implement type guards to ensure that cloned objects meet specific criteria.
- **JSON Serialization**: Use JSON serialization for deep copying simple objects, but be aware of its limitations.

### Try It Yourself

To better understand the Prototype Pattern, try modifying the code examples:

- Add new properties to the `ConcretePrototype` classes and update the `clone` method accordingly.
- Experiment with different cloning techniques, such as using utility libraries for deep copying.
- Implement a prototype registry that stores and retrieves prototypes for cloning.

### Visualizing the Prototype Pattern

Below is a class diagram illustrating the relationships between the `Prototype`, `ConcretePrototype`, and `Client`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Prototype {
        +clone() Prototype
    }
    class ConcretePrototype1 {
        +name: string
        +age: number
        +clone() Prototype
    }
    class ConcretePrototype2 {
        +title: string
        +description: string
        +clone() Prototype
    }
    Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype1
    Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype2
```

This diagram shows how the `ConcretePrototype1` and `ConcretePrototype2` classes implement the `Prototype` interface, providing their own cloning logic.
