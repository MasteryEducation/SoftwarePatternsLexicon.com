## 4.5.2 Deep vs. Shallow Copy

In the realm of software engineering, particularly when dealing with object-oriented programming, understanding how to copy objects is crucial. This knowledge becomes especially significant when implementing the Prototype Pattern, a creational design pattern that involves creating new objects by copying existing ones. In this section, we will delve into the concepts of deep and shallow copying, explore their differences, and examine their implications in TypeScript.

### Understanding Shallow Copy

A shallow copy of an object is a new object that is a copy of the original object, but it only copies the top-level properties. If the original object contains references to other objects, the shallow copy will only copy the references, not the actual objects. This means that changes to nested objects in the original will reflect in the shallow copy and vice versa.

#### Example of Shallow Copy in TypeScript

Let's consider an example to illustrate shallow copying in TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Address {
  street: string;
  city: string;
}

interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address: Address;
}

const originalPerson: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Wonderland"
  }
};

// Shallow copy using Object.assign
const shallowCopyPerson = Object.assign({}, originalPerson);

// Modifying the address in the shallow copy
shallowCopyPerson.address.street = "456 Elm St";

console.log(originalPerson.address.street); // Output: "456 Elm St"
```

In this example, `Object.assign()` creates a shallow copy of `originalPerson`. When we modify the `street` property of `address` in `shallowCopyPerson`, the change is reflected in `originalPerson` as well. This is because both objects share the same reference to the `address` object.

### Understanding Deep Copy

A deep copy, on the other hand, involves creating a new object and recursively copying all properties from the original object, including nested objects. This ensures that the copied object is entirely independent of the original, with no shared references.

#### Example of Deep Copy in TypeScript

To achieve a deep copy in TypeScript, one can use recursive functions or leverage libraries like `lodash`. Here's how you can implement a deep copy using recursion:

```typescript
function deepCopy<T>(obj: T): T {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== "object") {
    return obj;
  }

  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    const copy: any[] = [];
    for (const item of obj) {
      copy.push(deepCopy(item));
    }
    return copy as unknown as T;
  }

  const copy: { [key: string]: any } = {};
  for (const key in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key]);
    }
  }
  return copy as T;
}

const deepCopyPerson = deepCopy(originalPerson);

// Modifying the address in the deep copy
deepCopyPerson.address.street = "789 Oak St";

console.log(originalPerson.address.street); // Output: "456 Elm St"
```

In this example, the `deepCopy` function recursively copies each property, ensuring that nested objects are also duplicated. As a result, changes to `deepCopyPerson` do not affect `originalPerson`.

### Implications of Using Shallow Copies

Shallow copying is efficient and fast, but it can lead to unintended side effects when objects contain references to other objects. If the copied object is modified, the original object might also be affected, leading to bugs that are difficult to trace.

#### Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where you have a configuration object that is shared across multiple components in an application. If a component modifies a nested property in a shallow copy of this configuration, other components may inadvertently see these changes, potentially causing inconsistent behavior.

### Deep Copying to Prevent Unintended Side Effects

Deep copying is essential when you need to ensure that changes to a copied object do not affect the original object. This is particularly important in scenarios where objects are shared across different parts of an application, such as in state management or when implementing the Prototype Pattern.

#### Methods for Deep Copying in TypeScript

1. **Recursive Cloning**: As demonstrated earlier, recursive cloning is a straightforward approach to deep copying. However, it can be challenging to implement correctly for complex objects with circular references.

2. **Using Libraries**: Libraries like `lodash` provide utility functions for deep copying. The `_.cloneDeep` function from `lodash` is a popular choice:

   ```typescript
   import _ from 'lodash';

   const lodashDeepCopyPerson = _.cloneDeep(originalPerson);

   // Modifying the address in the lodash deep copy
   lodashDeepCopyPerson.address.street = "101 Pine St";

   console.log(originalPerson.address.street); // Output: "456 Elm St"
   ```

   `lodash` handles complex objects and circular references gracefully, making it a robust choice for deep copying.

### Performance Considerations

While deep copying ensures independence between objects, it can be more resource-intensive than shallow copying. The performance impact depends on the size and complexity of the objects being copied. Recursive deep copying can be slow for large objects, and using libraries like `lodash` can introduce additional overhead.

#### Strategies for Performance Optimization

- **Selective Deep Copying**: Only deep copy parts of the object that require independence. This reduces the overhead associated with copying large objects.

- **Immutable Data Structures**: Consider using immutable data structures, which inherently avoid the need for deep copying by ensuring that objects cannot be modified after creation.

- **Profiling and Benchmarking**: Use profiling tools to measure the performance impact of deep copying in your application. This can help identify bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.

### Visualizing Deep vs. Shallow Copy

To better understand the differences between deep and shallow copying, let's visualize the process using a diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Object] --> B[Shallow Copy]
    A --> C[Deep Copy]
    B --> D[Shared Reference]
    C --> E[Independent Copy]

    subgraph Shallow Copy
        B --> D
    end

    subgraph Deep Copy
        C --> E
    end
```

**Diagram Explanation**: In the shallow copy, the copied object shares references with the original object, leading to potential side effects. In the deep copy, all properties are independently copied, ensuring no shared references.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of deep and shallow copying, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Experiment with Different Data Structures**: Try copying arrays, nested objects, and objects with circular references.
- **Use Different Copying Methods**: Implement deep copying using both recursive functions and `lodash`.
- **Measure Performance**: Use the `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` methods in TypeScript to measure the time taken for shallow and deep copying operations.
