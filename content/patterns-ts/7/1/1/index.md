## 7.1.1 Implementing MVC in TypeScript

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a cornerstone of software architecture, particularly in web development. It divides an application into three interconnected components, allowing for efficient code organization and separation of concerns. In this guide, we'll delve into how to implement MVC in TypeScript, explore its integration with frameworks like Angular, and discuss alternative approaches without a framework. We'll also highlight how TypeScript's static typing and interfaces enhance MVC implementation.

### Understanding MVC Architecture

Before we dive into implementation, let's briefly recap the MVC architecture:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
- **View**: The presentation layer that displays the data to the user. It is responsible for rendering the user interface.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View. It listens to user input, processes it (often updating the Model), and returns the output display to the View.

This separation of concerns allows developers to manage complex applications more effectively, as changes to one component can be made with minimal impact on others.

### Setting Up an MVC Architecture in TypeScript

Let's start by setting up a basic MVC architecture in a TypeScript-based project. We'll create a simple application that manages a list of tasks.

#### Project Structure

Organizing your project directory is crucial for maintainability. Here's a suggested structure:

```
/my-mvc-app
  /src
    /models
      Task.ts
    /views
      TaskView.ts
    /controllers
      TaskController.ts
    /utils
      EventEmitter.ts
  /dist
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
```

- **/models**: Contains the data models.
- **/views**: Contains the view logic and templates.
- **/controllers**: Contains the controllers that handle input and update models.
- **/utils**: Contains utility classes, such as an EventEmitter for managing events.

#### Defining Models in TypeScript

Let's define a simple `Task` model. This model will represent a task with a title and a completion status.

```typescript
// src/models/Task.ts

export interface ITask {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

export class Task implements ITask {
  constructor(public id: number, public title: string, public completed: boolean = false) {}

  toggleCompletion(): void {
    this.completed = !this.completed;
  }
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- We define an `ITask` interface to enforce the structure of a task.
- The `Task` class implements this interface and provides a method to toggle the task's completion status.

#### Creating Views in TypeScript

The view will be responsible for rendering tasks and updating the DOM.

```typescript
// src/views/TaskView.ts

import { ITask } from '../models/Task';

export class TaskView {
  constructor(private rootElement: HTMLElement) {}

  render(tasks: ITask[]): void {
    this.rootElement.innerHTML = tasks.map(task => `
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" ${task.completed ? 'checked' : ''} data-id="${task.id}">
        <span>${task.title}</span>
      </div>
    `).join('');
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `TaskView` class takes a root HTML element where tasks will be rendered.
- The `render` method updates the DOM with the list of tasks.

#### Implementing Controllers in TypeScript

The controller will handle user interactions and update the model accordingly.

```typescript
// src/controllers/TaskController.ts

import { Task, ITask } from '../models/Task';
import { TaskView } from '../views/TaskView';

export class TaskController {
  private tasks: ITask[] = [];
  private taskView: TaskView;

  constructor(rootElement: HTMLElement) {
    this.taskView = new TaskView(rootElement);
    this.initialize();
  }

  private initialize(): void {
    this.tasks.push(new Task(1, 'Learn TypeScript'));
    this.tasks.push(new Task(2, 'Implement MVC Pattern'));
    this.taskView.render(this.tasks);
    this.bindEvents();
  }

  private bindEvents(): void {
    this.taskView.rootElement.addEventListener('change', (event: Event) => {
      const target = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
      const taskId = parseInt(target.dataset.id || '0', 10);
      this.toggleTaskCompletion(taskId);
    });
  }

  private toggleTaskCompletion(taskId: number): void {
    const task = this.tasks.find(t => t.id === taskId);
    if (task) {
      task.toggleCompletion();
      this.taskView.render(this.tasks);
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `TaskController` manages the list of tasks and the task view.
- It initializes the application by adding some tasks and rendering them.
- The `bindEvents` method listens for changes in the task checkboxes and updates the task's completion status.

### Enhancing MVC with TypeScript's Features

TypeScript's static typing and interfaces provide several advantages when implementing MVC:

1. **Type Safety**: Interfaces like `ITask` ensure that models adhere to a specific structure, reducing runtime errors.
2. **Readability**: Type annotations make the code more readable and self-documenting.
3. **Refactoring**: Static typing makes refactoring safer and more predictable.

### Integrating MVC with Angular

Angular is a popular framework that incorporates MVC principles. Let's explore how Angular leverages MVC and how TypeScript enhances this process.

#### Angular's MVC-Like Architecture

Angular doesn't strictly follow the traditional MVC pattern but rather a variation known as MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). However, the principles remain similar:

- **Model**: Represented by services and data models.
- **View**: Defined by templates and components.
- **Controller/ViewModel**: Implemented as Angular components that handle user input and update the model.

#### Example: Task Management in Angular

Let's implement a simple task management application using Angular.

**Setting Up Angular Project**

First, set up an Angular project using the Angular CLI:

```bash
ng new angular-mvc-app
cd angular-mvc-app
ng generate component task
ng generate service task
```

**Defining the Task Model**

```typescript
// src/app/task/task.model.ts

export interface Task {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}
```

**Creating the Task Service**

```typescript
// src/app/task/task.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Task } from './task.model';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class TaskService {
  private tasks: Task[] = [
    { id: 1, title: 'Learn Angular', completed: false },
    { id: 2, title: 'Implement MVC', completed: false }
  ];

  getTasks(): Task[] {
    return this.tasks;
  }

  toggleTaskCompletion(taskId: number): void {
    const task = this.tasks.find(t => t.id === taskId);
    if (task) {
      task.completed = !task.completed;
    }
  }
}
```

**Building the Task Component**

```typescript
// src/app/task/task.component.ts

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { TaskService } from './task.service';
import { Task } from './task.model';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-task',
  templateUrl: './task.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./task.component.css']
})
export class TaskComponent implements OnInit {
  tasks: Task[] = [];

  constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.tasks = this.taskService.getTasks();
  }

  toggleCompletion(taskId: number): void {
    this.taskService.toggleTaskCompletion(taskId);
  }
}
```

**Task Component Template**

```html
<!-- src/app/task/task.component.html -->

<div *ngFor="let task of tasks">
  <input type="checkbox" [checked]="task.completed" (change)="toggleCompletion(task.id)">
  <span>{{ task.title }}</span>
</div>
```

**Explanation**:
- The `TaskService` manages the task data and provides methods to manipulate it.
- The `TaskComponent` fetches tasks from the service and renders them.
- The component template uses Angular's data binding to display tasks and handle user interactions.

### Alternative Approaches Without a Framework

While frameworks like Angular provide a robust structure for MVC, it's also possible to implement MVC without them. This approach might be suitable for smaller projects or when you want more control over the architecture.

#### Handling State and Data Binding

In a non-framework MVC setup, managing state and data binding can be achieved using custom event systems or libraries like RxJS for reactive programming.

**Example: Custom Event Emitter**

```typescript
// src/utils/EventEmitter.ts

type Listener<T> = (event: T) => void;

export class EventEmitter<T> {
  private listeners: Listener<T>[] = [];

  on(listener: Listener<T>): void {
    this.listeners.push(listener);
  }

  off(listener: Listener<T>): void {
    this.listeners = this.listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
  }

  emit(event: T): void {
    this.listeners.forEach(listener => listener(event));
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `EventEmitter` class allows components to subscribe to events and react when they occur.
- This can be used to notify views when the model changes, enabling data binding.

### Handling Routing and User Input

Routing is an essential part of MVC applications, especially in web development. In a framework-less setup, you can use libraries like `page.js` or `Navigo` for client-side routing.

**Example: Simple Routing with page.js**

```typescript
import page from 'page';

page('/', () => {
  console.log('Home');
});

page('/tasks', () => {
  console.log('Tasks');
});

page.start();
```

**Explanation**:
- This example uses `page.js` to define routes and their corresponding actions.
- Routing allows you to navigate between different views in your application.

### Best Practices for Organizing Files and Directories

1. **Modular Structure**: Organize your code into modules (e.g., models, views, controllers) to enhance maintainability.
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for files and classes to make the codebase easier to navigate.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic, presentation, and data access separate to adhere to MVC principles.
4. **Documentation**: Document your code and architecture to facilitate collaboration and future maintenance.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by:

- Adding new features, such as editing or deleting tasks.
- Implementing additional models and views.
- Integrating state management libraries like Redux for more complex applications.

### Conclusion

Implementing MVC in TypeScript provides a structured approach to building web applications, leveraging TypeScript's features for enhanced type safety and maintainability. Whether using a framework like Angular or opting for a custom setup, understanding MVC principles is crucial for developing scalable and maintainable applications.
