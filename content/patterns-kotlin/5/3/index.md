## 5.3 Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In this section, we will delve deep into the Composite Pattern, its implementation in Kotlin using recursive data structures, and how sealed classes can be leveraged to create robust composite structures.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Composite Pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to represent a hierarchy of objects, where each object can be a composite of other objects or a leaf node.

### Key Participants

1. **Component**: An interface or abstract class that defines the common operations for both composite and leaf nodes.
2. **Leaf**: Represents the end objects of a composition. A leaf has no children.
3. **Composite**: A class that represents a group of leaf objects. It implements the component interface and contains child components.
4. **Client**: The class that interacts with the components through the component interface.

### Applicability

Use the Composite Pattern when:

- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- You want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.
- You need to simplify client code that deals with complex tree structures.

### Implementing Composites with Recursive Data Structures

In Kotlin, recursive data structures can be effectively used to implement the Composite Pattern. Let's explore how to create a simple file system structure using this pattern.

#### Example: File System Structure

Consider a file system where each file or folder can be treated uniformly. A folder can contain multiple files or other folders, and a file is a leaf node with no children.

```kotlin
// Component
interface FileSystemComponent {
    fun showDetails()
}

// Leaf
class File(private val name: String) : FileSystemComponent {
    override fun showDetails() {
        println("File: $name")
    }
}

// Composite
class Folder(private val name: String) : FileSystemComponent {
    private val components = mutableListOf<FileSystemComponent>()

    fun addComponent(component: FileSystemComponent) {
        components.add(component)
    }

    fun removeComponent(component: FileSystemComponent) {
        components.remove(component)
    }

    override fun showDetails() {
        println("Folder: $name")
        components.forEach { it.showDetails() }
    }
}

// Client
fun main() {
    val file1 = File("File1.txt")
    val file2 = File("File2.txt")
    val folder = Folder("Documents")
    folder.addComponent(file1)
    folder.addComponent(file2)

    val rootFolder = Folder("Root")
    rootFolder.addComponent(folder)

    rootFolder.showDetails()
}
```

In this example, `File` is a leaf node, and `Folder` is a composite node that can contain both files and other folders. The `showDetails` method is implemented in both the leaf and composite classes, allowing the client to treat them uniformly.

### Using Sealed Classes for Composite Structures

Kotlin's sealed classes provide a powerful way to implement composite structures. Sealed classes restrict the class hierarchy, ensuring that all subclasses are known at compile time. This feature is particularly useful for implementing the Composite Pattern, as it allows for exhaustive `when` expressions and type safety.

#### Example: Expression Tree

Let's implement an expression tree using sealed classes to demonstrate how they can be used to create composite structures.

```kotlin
// Sealed class representing an expression
sealed class Expression {
    data class Number(val value: Int) : Expression()
    data class Sum(val left: Expression, val right: Expression) : Expression()
    data class Product(val left: Expression, val right: Expression) : Expression()
}

// Function to evaluate an expression
fun evaluate(expression: Expression): Int = when (expression) {
    is Expression.Number -> expression.value
    is Expression.Sum -> evaluate(expression.left) + evaluate(expression.right)
    is Expression.Product -> evaluate(expression.left) * evaluate(expression.right)
}

// Client
fun main() {
    val expression = Expression.Sum(
        Expression.Number(5),
        Expression.Product(
            Expression.Number(2),
            Expression.Number(3)
        )
    )

    println("Result: ${evaluate(expression)}")
}
```

In this example, we define a sealed class `Expression` with three subclasses: `Number`, `Sum`, and `Product`. The `evaluate` function uses a `when` expression to evaluate the expression tree, demonstrating how sealed classes can be used to create type-safe composite structures.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Composite Pattern in Kotlin, consider the following:

- **Type Safety**: Kotlin's type system and sealed classes provide strong type safety, reducing runtime errors.
- **Immutability**: Consider using immutable data structures for composite objects to prevent unintended modifications.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of recursive structures, especially with large hierarchies.

### Differences and Similarities

The Composite Pattern is often confused with the Decorator Pattern, as both involve tree structures. However, the Composite Pattern focuses on part-whole hierarchies, while the Decorator Pattern focuses on adding behavior to objects dynamically.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided examples by adding new operations or components. For instance, try adding a `Difference` operation to the expression tree or a `Shortcut` component to the file system structure.

### Visualizing Composite Structures

To better understand the Composite Pattern, let's visualize the file system structure using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class FileSystemComponent {
        <<interface>>
        +showDetails()
    }
    class File {
        +showDetails()
    }
    class Folder {
        +addComponent(component: FileSystemComponent)
        +removeComponent(component: FileSystemComponent)
        +showDetails()
    }
    FileSystemComponent <|-- File
    FileSystemComponent <|-- Folder
    Folder o-- FileSystemComponent
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `FileSystemComponent`, `File`, and `Folder` classes, highlighting the composite structure.
