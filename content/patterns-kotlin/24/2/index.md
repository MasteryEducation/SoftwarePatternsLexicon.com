### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of Kotlin design patterns, try implementing some of the patterns discussed in the recommended resources. Experiment with different approaches and see how Kotlin's features can enhance the implementation of these patterns. For instance, try using coroutines to implement the Observer pattern or create a DSL for a specific domain.

### Visualizing Design Patterns

To help visualize the relationships and interactions between different design patterns, consider creating diagrams using Mermaid.js. For example, you can create a class diagram to illustrate the structure of the Factory pattern or a sequence diagram to show the flow of the Observer pattern. These visualizations can aid in understanding the complexities of design patterns and how they fit into larger architectures.
