## 3.3 Inline Classes (Value Classes)

In this section, we delve into Kotlin's inline classes, also known as value classes, a powerful feature that allows developers to reduce object overhead and create type-safe wrappers. By understanding and effectively utilizing inline classes, you can enhance the performance and maintainability of your Kotlin applications.

### Introduction to Inline Classes

Inline classes in Kotlin are a feature that allows you to create a type that wraps a single value, providing a way to define a new type without the overhead of an additional object. This is particularly useful for creating type-safe wrappers around primitive types or other objects, ensuring that your code is both efficient and expressive.

#### Key Concepts

- **Object Overhead**: In traditional object-oriented programming, creating a new object involves memory allocation and garbage collection overhead. Inline classes help mitigate this by avoiding the creation of an additional object at runtime.
- **Type Safety**: Inline classes allow you to define distinct types for different concepts, even if they are represented by the same underlying type, enhancing type safety and reducing the risk of errors.

### Benefits of Using Inline Classes

1. **Performance Optimization**: Inline classes reduce the memory footprint by avoiding unnecessary object creation. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially in performance-critical applications.
2. **Type Safety**: By wrapping a primitive type or another object, inline classes provide a way to create distinct types, reducing the risk of mixing up values that should be treated differently.
3. **Code Clarity**: Inline classes can make your code more readable and maintainable by providing meaningful names for wrapped values.

### Creating Inline Classes

To define an inline class in Kotlin, use the `value` keyword followed by the class name and a single property. Here's a basic example:

```kotlin
@JvmInline
value class UserId(val id: String)
```

In this example, `UserId` is an inline class that wraps a `String`. The `@JvmInline` annotation is used to indicate that this is an inline class.

#### Code Example: Inline Class for Type Safety

Let's consider a scenario where you need to handle user IDs and product IDs separately, even though both are represented as strings. Using inline classes, you can ensure type safety:

```kotlin
@JvmInline
value class UserId(val id: String)

@JvmInline
value class ProductId(val id: String)

fun processUser(userId: UserId) {
    println("Processing user with ID: ${userId.id}")
}

fun processProduct(productId: ProductId) {
    println("Processing product with ID: ${productId.id}")
}

fun main() {
    val userId = UserId("user123")
    val productId = ProductId("product456")

    processUser(userId)
    processProduct(productId)

    // The following would cause a compile-time error
    // processUser(productId)
}
```

### Reducing Object Overhead

Inline classes help reduce object overhead by eliminating the need for an additional wrapper object at runtime. The Kotlin compiler optimizes inline classes by substituting the wrapped value directly where possible.

#### Performance Considerations

- **Inlining**: When an inline class is used, the compiler attempts to inline the wrapped value, avoiding the creation of an additional object. This can lead to performance gains, especially in tight loops or frequently called functions.
- **Boxing and Unboxing**: In some cases, such as when using inline classes with generics or reflection, the compiler may need to box the value. Be mindful of these scenarios to avoid potential performance pitfalls.

### Creating Type-Safe Wrappers

Inline classes are ideal for creating type-safe wrappers around primitive types or other objects. This is particularly useful when you want to enforce domain-specific constraints or provide additional functionality.

#### Code Example: Type-Safe Wrapper for Currency

Consider a scenario where you need to handle monetary values safely. You can use an inline class to create a type-safe wrapper for currency:

```kotlin
@JvmInline
value class Currency(val amount: Double) {
    init {
        require(amount >= 0) { "Amount must be non-negative" }
    }

    operator fun plus(other: Currency): Currency {
        return Currency(this.amount + other.amount)
    }

    operator fun minus(other: Currency): Currency {
        require(this.amount >= other.amount) { "Insufficient funds" }
        return Currency(this.amount - other.amount)
    }
}

fun main() {
    val balance = Currency(100.0)
    val withdrawal = Currency(30.0)

    val newBalance = balance - withdrawal
    println("New balance: ${newBalance.amount}")

    // The following would cause an exception
    // val negativeBalance = balance - Currency(150.0)
}
```

### Design Considerations

When using inline classes, consider the following:

- **Single Property**: Inline classes can only have one property. If you need to wrap multiple values, consider using a data class instead.
- **Immutability**: Inline classes are inherently immutable, which aligns well with functional programming principles and helps prevent unintended side effects.
- **Interoperability**: Inline classes are fully interoperable with Java, but be aware of potential boxing when using them in Java code.

### Differences and Similarities with Other Patterns

Inline classes are similar to data classes in that they provide a concise way to define a type. However, inline classes are optimized for performance and type safety, whereas data classes are designed for representing complex data structures with multiple properties.

#### Comparison with Data Classes

- **Inline Classes**: Focus on reducing overhead and providing type safety for a single value.
- **Data Classes**: Designed for representing structured data with multiple properties and provide features like `copy()` and `equals()`.

### Visualizing Inline Classes

To better understand how inline classes work, let's visualize the concept using a diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class UserId {
        -String id
    }
    class ProductId {
        -String id
    }
    class Currency {
        -Double amount
        +Currency plus(Currency)
        +Currency minus(Currency)
    }
```
