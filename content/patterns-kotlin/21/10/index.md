### Code Example: Contributing to an Open-Source Kotlin Project

Let's walk through a simple example of contributing to an open-source Kotlin project. We'll use a hypothetical project called "KotlinUtils," which provides utility functions for Kotlin developers.

#### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork the KotlinUtils repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/KotlinUtils.git
cd KotlinUtils
```

#### Step 2: Identify an Issue

Next, identify an issue to work on. Let's say there's an open issue to add a new utility function for calculating the factorial of a number.

#### Step 3: Implement the Function

Open the project in your favorite IDE and navigate to the appropriate file. Implement the factorial function as follows:

```kotlin
/**
 * Calculates the factorial of a given number.
 *
 * @param n The number to calculate the factorial for.
 * @return The factorial of the given number.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if n is negative.
 */
fun factorial(n: Int): Long {
    require(n >= 0) { "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers." }
    return if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

#### Step 4: Test Your Changes

Add tests for the new function to ensure it works correctly. Create a test file and add the following test cases:

```kotlin
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class FactorialTest {

    @Test
    fun testFactorial() {
        assertEquals(1, factorial(0))
        assertEquals(1, factorial(1))
        assertEquals(2, factorial(2))
        assertEquals(6, factorial(3))
        assertEquals(24, factorial(4))
        assertEquals(120, factorial(5))
    }

    @Test
    fun testFactorialNegative() {
        try {
            factorial(-1)
        } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
            assertEquals("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.", e.message)
        }
    }
}
```

Run the tests to ensure they pass:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

#### Step 5: Submit a Pull Request

Once your changes are tested and ready, commit them and push to your forked repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add factorial utility function"
git push origin main
```

Finally, submit a pull request to the original KotlinUtils repository, providing a clear description of your changes and referencing the issue number.
