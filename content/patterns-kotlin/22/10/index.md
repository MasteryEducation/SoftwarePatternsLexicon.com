   dependencies {
       implementation("io.ktor:ktor-server-core:2.0.0")
       implementation("io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:2.0.0")
       implementation("io.ktor:ktor-server-html-builder:2.0.0")
       implementation("ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.3")
   }
   ```

3. **Setup Application Module**: Create an `Application.kt` file and configure your Ktor application:

   ```kotlin
   import io.ktor.application.*
   import io.ktor.features.ContentNegotiation
   import io.ktor.features.DefaultHeaders
   import io.ktor.features.CallLogging
   import io.ktor.gson.gson
   import io.ktor.response.*
   import io.ktor.routing.*
   import io.ktor.server.engine.embeddedServer
   import io.ktor.server.netty.Netty

   fun main() {
       embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080, module = Application::module).start(wait = true)
   }

   fun Application.module() {
       install(DefaultHeaders)
       install(CallLogging)
       install(ContentNegotiation) {
           gson {
               setPrettyPrinting()
           }
       }
       routing {
           get("/") {
               call.respondText("Hello, Ktor!")
           }
       }
   }
   ```

#### Implementing RESTful APIs

1. **Define Routes**: Use Ktor's routing feature to define API endpoints.

   ```kotlin
   routing {
       route("/api") {
           get("/users") {
               call.respond(listOf("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"))
           }
           post("/users") {
               // Handle user creation
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Handle Requests and Responses**: Utilize Ktor's request and response handling capabilities to process data.

   ```kotlin
   post("/users") {
       val user = call.receive<User>()
       // Process user data
       call.respond(HttpStatusCode.Created, user)
   }
   ```

### Building the Frontend with React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With Kotlin/JS, you can write React components in Kotlin.

#### Setting Up a Kotlin/JS Project

1. **Initialize the Project**: Use the Kotlin Multiplatform project setup to create a Kotlin/JS project.

   ```bash
   gradle init --type kotlin-multiplatform
   ```

2. **Configure Dependencies**: Add React and Kotlin/JS dependencies to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

   ```kotlin
   kotlin {
       js {
           browser {
               binaries.executable()
           }
       }
   }

   dependencies {
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react:17.0.2-pre.153-kotlin-1.5.21")
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react-dom:17.0.2-pre.153-kotlin-1.5.21")
   }
   ```

3. **Create React Components**: Write React components in Kotlin using the Kotlin/JS React wrapper.

   ```kotlin
   import react.*
   import react.dom.*

   external interface AppProps : RProps {
       var name: String
   }

   val App = functionalComponent<AppProps> { props ->
       div {
           h1 {
               +"Hello, ${props.name}!"
           }
       }
   }

   fun main() {
       render(document.getElementById("root")) {
           child(App) {
               attrs.name = "Kotlin/JS"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Integrating Backend and Frontend

To create a seamless full-stack application, we need to integrate the backend and frontend components.

#### Setting Up API Communication

1. **Use HTTP Clients**: Utilize HTTP clients like Axios or Fetch API to communicate with the backend.

   ```kotlin
   import kotlinx.browser.window
   import kotlinx.coroutines.await
   import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable
   import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json
   import kotlinx.serialization.json.decodeFromString

   @Serializable
   data class User(val name: String)

   suspend fun fetchUsers(): List<User> {
       val response = window.fetch("/api/users").await()
       val json = response.text().await()
       return Json.decodeFromString(json)
   }
   ```

2. **Handle Asynchronous Data**: Use Kotlin coroutines to handle asynchronous data fetching and updates.

   ```kotlin
   val UsersComponent = functionalComponent<RProps> {
       val (users, setUsers) = useState(emptyList<User>())

       useEffectOnce {
           MainScope().launch {
               val fetchedUsers = fetchUsers()
               setUsers(fetchedUsers)
           }
       }

       ul {
           users.forEach { user ->
               li {
                   +user.name
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Deploying the Full-stack Application

Once the application is built, the next step is deployment. You can deploy the backend and frontend separately or together, depending on your infrastructure.

#### Deploying the Backend

1. **Containerization with Docker**: Use Docker to containerize your Ktor backend application.

   ```dockerfile
   FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
   COPY build/libs/ktor-backend.jar /app/ktor-backend.jar
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/ktor-backend.jar"]
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloud Providers**: Deploy your Docker container to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

#### Deploying the Frontend

1. **Build the Frontend**: Use the Kotlin/JS Gradle plugin to build the frontend application.

   ```bash
   ./gradlew browserProductionWebpack
   ```

2. **Serve Static Files**: Use a web server like Nginx or Apache to serve the static files generated by the build process.

### Integrating with Angular

Angular is another popular frontend framework that can be integrated with Kotlin/JS.

#### Setting Up Angular with Kotlin/JS

1. **Initialize Angular Project**: Use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project.

   ```bash
   ng new angular-kotlin-app

   ```kotlin
   import angular.core.Component

   @Component(
       selector = "app-root",
       template = "<h1>Hello, Kotlin/JS with Angular!</h1>"
   )
   class AppComponent
   ```

### Best Practices for Full-stack Development

1. **Code Organization**: Keep your code organized by separating concerns and following the MVC or MVVM pattern.
2. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend components to ensure reliability.
