## 19.10 Reducing APK and App Size for Optimal Performance

As mobile applications grow in complexity, managing their size becomes crucial for ensuring optimal performance, faster downloads, and better user experience. In this section, we will explore various strategies to reduce APK and app size in Kotlin-based Android applications. We will delve into resource optimization, code shrinking using ProGuard and R8, and other advanced techniques that can significantly impact your app's footprint.

### Understanding APK Size

An APK (Android Package) is the file format used by Android to distribute and install applications. It contains all the necessary components, including code, resources, and assets. A larger APK can lead to slower downloads, increased data usage, and potential installation failures on devices with limited storage. Therefore, reducing APK size is essential for reaching a wider audience and improving app performance.

### Key Strategies for Reducing APK Size

#### 1. Code Shrinking with ProGuard and R8

**ProGuard** and **R8** are tools used to shrink, obfuscate, and optimize your code. They remove unused classes and methods, which can significantly reduce the size of your APK.

- **ProGuard**: A tool that analyzes and optimizes Java bytecode. It removes unused code, renames classes and methods to shorter names, and performs other optimizations.

- **R8**: The successor to ProGuard, integrated into the Android build process. R8 offers better performance and more advanced optimizations.

**Steps to Enable R8:**

1. **Enable Code Shrinking**: In your `build.gradle` file, set `minifyEnabled` to `true` in the `release` build type.

   ```kotlin
   android {
       buildTypes {
           release {
               minifyEnabled true
               proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure ProGuard Rules**: Customize the `proguard-rules.pro` file to specify which parts of your code should not be removed or obfuscated.

   ```proguard
   # Keep all public classes and methods
   -keep public class * {
       public *;
   }
   ```

3. **Test Your App**: After enabling R8, thoroughly test your app to ensure that no critical code has been removed.

#### 2. Resource Optimization

Resources such as images, layouts, and strings can contribute significantly to APK size. Optimizing these resources can lead to substantial size reductions.

- **Image Compression**: Use tools like **PNGCrush** or **WebP** format to compress images without losing quality.

- **Remove Unused Resources**: Use Android Studio's **Lint** tool to identify and remove unused resources.

- **Vector Drawables**: Replace raster images with vector drawables where possible. Vector drawables are scalable and often smaller in size.

- **Resource Splitting**: Use resource qualifiers to provide different resources for different device configurations, reducing the need to include all resources in every APK.

#### 3. Dynamic Delivery and App Bundles

**Android App Bundles** allow you to deliver optimized APKs for each device configuration, reducing the overall size of the download.

- **Dynamic Feature Modules**: Split your app into modules that can be downloaded on-demand, reducing the initial download size.

- **Play Feature Delivery**: Use Play Feature Delivery to control how and when feature modules are delivered to users.

#### 4. Code Optimization

- **Remove Unused Code**: Regularly review your codebase to identify and remove unused classes, methods, and libraries.

- **Use Kotlin's Language Features**: Leverage Kotlin's concise syntax and features like `data classes` and `extension functions` to reduce boilerplate code.

- **Optimize Libraries**: Use lightweight libraries and avoid including entire libraries if only a small part is needed.

#### 5. Native Libraries and NDK

If your app uses native libraries, ensure they are optimized for size.

- **ABI Splitting**: Use ABI splits to generate separate APKs for different CPU architectures, reducing the size of each APK.

- **Strip Debug Symbols**: Remove debug symbols from native libraries to reduce their size.

### Visualizing APK Size Reduction

To better understand the impact of these strategies, let's visualize the process of APK size reduction using a flowchart.

    F --> G[End]
```

### Code Example: Enabling R8 and ProGuard

Let's look at a practical example of enabling R8 and configuring ProGuard rules in a Kotlin project.

```kotlin
// build.gradle (Module: app)
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.myapp"
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 33
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

```proguard
# Keep all public classes and methods
-keep public class * {
    public *;
}

-keep class com.example.myapp.MyClass {
    *;
}

-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    native <methods>;
}
```

### Try It Yourself

To experiment with APK size reduction, try the following:

1. **Modify ProGuard Rules**: Add or remove rules in the `proguard-rules.pro` file and observe the impact on APK size.

2. **Enable Resource Shrinking**: Set `shrinkResources` to `true` in your `build.gradle` file and see how it affects the APK size.

3. **Test with Different Image Formats**: Convert some images to WebP format and compare the APK size before and after.

### Advanced Techniques

#### 1. Analyzing APK Content

Use tools like **APK Analyzer** in Android Studio to inspect the contents of your APK and identify large files or resources that can be optimized.

#### 2. Multi-APK Support

For apps targeting a wide range of devices, consider using **Multi-APK** to generate different APKs for different device configurations, such as screen density and CPU architecture.

#### 3. Obfuscation and Security

While reducing APK size, also consider the security benefits of obfuscation. ProGuard and R8 can help protect your code from reverse engineering.
