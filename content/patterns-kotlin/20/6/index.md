## 20.6 Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) is a powerful technology that allows developers to write shared code for both iOS and Android, streamlining the development process and reducing duplication. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of KMM, exploring its architecture, benefits, and practical implementation. We will also provide code examples, diagrams, and exercises to help you master this innovative approach to mobile development.

### Introduction to Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is part of JetBrains' Kotlin Multiplatform project, designed to enable code sharing across different platforms. KMM specifically targets mobile development, allowing developers to write common code for iOS and Android applications. This approach not only reduces the time and effort required to develop mobile apps but also ensures consistency across platforms.

#### Key Concepts

- **Shared Code**: Write business logic once and use it on both iOS and Android.
- **Platform-Specific Code**: Implement platform-specific features using Kotlin's expect/actual mechanism.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate with existing iOS and Android codebases.

### Architecture of KMM

KMM projects are structured to separate shared and platform-specific code. The typical architecture includes:

- **Shared Module**: Contains the common code, including business logic, data models, and utilities.
- **iOS and Android Modules**: Contain platform-specific code, including UI components and platform-specific APIs.

#### Diagram: KMM Architecture

```mermaid

    A[Shared Module] --> B[iOS Module];
    A --> C[Android Module];
    B --> D[iOS App];
    C --> E[Android App];
```

**Description**: This diagram illustrates the separation of shared and platform-specific modules in a KMM project. The shared module is used by both the iOS and Android modules, which then integrate with their respective apps.

### Setting Up a KMM Project

To get started with KMM, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Install IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio**: Ensure you have the latest version with Kotlin Multiplatform support.
2. **Create a New Project**: Use the KMM project template to create a new project.
3. **Configure Gradle**: Set up your `build.gradle.kts` files to include the necessary dependencies for KMM.

#### Sample `build.gradle.kts` Configuration

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform")
    id("com.android.application")
}

kotlin {
    android()
    iosX64()
    iosArm64()

    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.5.2")
            }
        }
        val androidMain by getting
        val iosMain by getting
    }
}

android {
    compileSdkVersion(30)
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId = "com.example.kmmapp"
        minSdkVersion(21)
        targetSdkVersion(30)
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: This configuration sets up a KMM project with shared, Android, and iOS source sets. It includes dependencies for Kotlin coroutines, which are commonly used in KMM projects.

### Writing Shared Business Logic

The core advantage of KMM is the ability to write shared business logic. This includes data processing, network requests, and other non-UI code.

#### Example: Shared Business Logic

```kotlin
// Shared code in the commonMain source set
class Greeting {
    fun greet(): String {
        return "Hello, Kotlin Multiplatform!"
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: This simple example demonstrates a shared class that can be used on both iOS and Android to provide a greeting message.

### Platform-Specific Code

While KMM allows for shared code, some features require platform-specific implementations. This is where Kotlin's `expect` and `actual` keywords come into play.

#### Example: Platform-Specific Code

```kotlin
// Shared code
expect fun platformName(): String

// Android-specific implementation
actual fun platformName(): String {
    return "Android"
}

// iOS-specific implementation
actual fun platformName(): String {
    return "iOS"
}
```

**Explanation**: The `expect` keyword is used in the shared code to declare a function that will have platform-specific implementations. The `actual` keyword is used in the platform-specific code to provide these implementations.

### Integrating with iOS and Android

KMM allows you to integrate shared code into existing iOS and Android projects. This involves setting up the appropriate build configurations and dependencies.

#### Integrating with Android

1. **Add the Shared Module**: Include the shared module as a dependency in your Android project.
2. **Use Shared Code**: Call shared functions and classes from your Android code.

#### Integrating with iOS

1. **Generate a Framework**: Use the `kotlin.native.cocoapods` plugin to generate an iOS framework from the shared module.
2. **Include the Framework**: Add the generated framework to your Xcode project.
3. **Use Shared Code**: Call shared functions and classes from your Swift or Objective-C code.

### Testing in KMM

Testing is a crucial part of any development process. KMM supports testing shared code using Kotlin's testing libraries.

#### Example: Unit Testing Shared Code

```kotlin
import kotlin.test.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class GreetingTest {
    @Test
    fun testGreet() {
        val greeting = Greeting()
        assertEquals("Hello, Kotlin Multiplatform!", greeting.greet())
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to write a unit test for shared code using Kotlin's `kotlin.test` library.

### Benefits of Using KMM

- **Code Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere.
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent behavior across platforms.
- **Reduced Development Time**: Focus on writing business logic instead of duplicating code.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Platform-Specific Features**: Some features still require platform-specific code.
- **Tooling and Ecosystem**: KMM is still evolving, and tooling may not be as mature as native development.
- **Performance**: Ensure that shared code is optimized for both platforms.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with KMM, try modifying the provided code examples. For instance, add a new function to the `Greeting` class that returns a personalized greeting based on a user's name. Implement platform-specific logic to fetch the user's name from the device settings.

### Visualizing KMM Workflow
