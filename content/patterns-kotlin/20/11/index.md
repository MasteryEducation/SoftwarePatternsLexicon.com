       id("org.jetbrains.compose") version "1.0.0"
   }

   dependencies {
       implementation(compose.desktop.currentOs)
   }
   ```

### Building Your First Desktop Application

Let's build a simple desktop application to demonstrate the capabilities of Jetpack Compose for Desktop. We'll create a basic application that displays a greeting message.

#### Step 1: Define the Main Function

Start by defining the main function, which serves as the entry point for your application:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.ui.window.Window
import androidx.compose.ui.window.application

fun main() = application {
    Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
        Greeting("World")
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Composable Function

Define a composable function to display the greeting message:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.material.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable

@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Text(text = "Hello, $name!")
}
```

#### Step 3: Run the Application

Execute the application from IntelliJ IDEA. You should see a window displaying the message "Hello, World!".

### Understanding the Compose for Desktop Architecture

Jetpack Compose for Desktop follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is built using composable functions. These functions describe the UI hierarchy and are responsible for rendering the UI components.

#### Key Components of Compose for Desktop

- **Composable Functions**: The building blocks of the UI, defined using the `@Composable` annotation.
- **State Management**: Compose uses state to manage UI updates. The `remember` and `mutableStateOf` functions are commonly used for state management.
- **Layouts**: Compose provides a variety of layout components, such as `Column`, `Row`, and `Box`, to arrange UI elements.
- **Modifiers**: Modifiers are used to style and configure composable functions, allowing developers to apply properties like padding, size, and alignment.

### Advanced UI Development with Compose for Desktop

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can explore more advanced UI development techniques in Compose for Desktop.

#### Building Complex Layouts

Compose for Desktop offers powerful layout components to build complex UIs. Here's an example of a layout using `Column` and `Row`:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Row
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.padding
import androidx.compose.material.Button
import androidx.compose.material.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp

@Composable
fun ComplexLayout() {
    Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
        Text("Welcome to Kotlin Desktop App")
        Row {
            Button(onClick = { /* Handle click */ }) {
                Text("Button 1")
            }
            Button(onClick = { /* Handle click */ }) {
                Text("Button 2")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### State Management and Recomposition

State management is crucial in Compose applications. Use `remember` and `mutableStateOf` to manage state and trigger recompositions:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf
import androidx.compose.runtime.remember

@Composable
fun CounterApp() {
    val count = remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    Column {
        Text("Count: ${count.value}")
        Button(onClick = { count.value++ }) {
            Text("Increment")
        }
    }
}
```

### Integrating with Existing Codebases

Compose for Desktop can be integrated with existing Java and Kotlin codebases, allowing for a gradual transition to the new framework.

#### Interoperability with Java

Compose for Desktop supports interoperability with Java, enabling developers to leverage existing Java libraries and frameworks. Here's an example of calling a Java method from a Kotlin composable:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.material.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable

class JavaClass {
    fun getMessage(): String = "Hello from Java"
}

@Composable
fun JavaInteropExample() {
    val message = JavaClass().getMessage()
    Text(message)
}
```
