- **Coroutines**: Kotlin's coroutines are available in Kotlin/JS, enabling asynchronous programming with ease.

### Setting Up a Kotlin/JS Project

To get started with Kotlin/JS, you need to set up a project. Let's walk through the process of creating a basic Kotlin/JS project using Gradle.

#### Step-by-Step Project Setup

1. **Install Kotlin and Gradle**: Ensure you have Kotlin and Gradle installed on your machine. You can download them from their respective official websites.

2. **Create a New Project**: Use the following command to create a new Kotlin/JS project:

   ```bash
   gradle init --type kotlin-js
   ```

3. **Configure the `build.gradle.kts` File**: Open the `build.gradle.kts` file and configure it for Kotlin/JS:

   ```kotlin
   plugins {
       kotlin("js") version "1.8.0"
   }

   repositories {
       mavenCentral()
   }

   kotlin {
       js {
           browser {
               binaries.executable()
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Add Dependencies**: Add any necessary dependencies to your project. For example, to use React, you can add:

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react:17.0.2-pre.148-kotlin-1.8.0")
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react-dom:17.0.2-pre.148-kotlin-1.8.0")
   }
   ```

5. **Run the Project**: Use the following command to build and run your Kotlin/JS project:

   ```bash
   gradle browserDevelopmentRun
   ```

### Interoperability with JavaScript

Kotlin/JS offers seamless interoperability with JavaScript, allowing you to call JavaScript functions and use JavaScript libraries in your Kotlin code.

#### Calling JavaScript from Kotlin

To call a JavaScript function from Kotlin, you can use the `@JsName` annotation. Here's an example:

```kotlin
@JsName("alert")
external fun showAlert(message: String)

fun main() {
    showAlert("Hello from Kotlin/JS!")
}
```

#### Using JavaScript Libraries

You can use existing JavaScript libraries in your Kotlin/JS project by adding them as dependencies. For instance, to use Lodash, you can add:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(npm("lodash", "4.17.21"))
}
```

### Frontend Development with Kotlin/JS

Kotlin/JS is particularly powerful for frontend development, allowing you to build rich web applications with frameworks like React.

#### Using React with Kotlin/JS

Kotlin/JS provides wrappers for React, enabling you to build React components using Kotlin. This allows you to take advantage of Kotlin's type safety and concise syntax while working with React.

##### Creating a Simple React Component

Let's create a simple React component using Kotlin/JS:

```kotlin
import react.*
import react.dom.*

external interface AppProps : RProps {
    var name: String
}

val App = functionalComponent<AppProps> { props ->
    h1 {
        +"Hello, ${props.name}!"
    }
}

fun main() {
    render(document.getElementById("root")) {
        child(App) {
            attrs.name = "Kotlin/JS"
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a functional component `App` that takes a `name` prop and renders a greeting message. We then render this component to the DOM.

#### State Management in Kotlin/JS

State management is a crucial aspect of frontend development. Kotlin/JS supports React's state management capabilities, allowing you to manage component state effectively.

##### Using Hooks for State Management

Kotlin/JS supports React hooks, enabling you to manage state in functional components. Here's an example using the `useState` hook:

```kotlin
import react.*
import react.dom.*

val Counter = functionalComponent<RProps> {
    val (count, setCount) = useState(0)

    div {
        h1 {
            +"Count: $count"
        }
        button {
            +"Increment"
            attrs.onClickFunction = {
                setCount(count + 1)
            }
        }
    }
}

fun main() {
    render(document.getElementById("root")) {
        child(Counter)
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Counter` component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the count state. Clicking the button increments the count.

### Advanced Concepts in Kotlin/JS

Kotlin/JS offers advanced features that allow you to build complex and efficient web applications.

#### Coroutines in Kotlin/JS

Kotlin's coroutines are available in Kotlin/JS, enabling you to perform asynchronous operations efficiently.

##### Using Coroutines for Asynchronous Operations

Here's an example of using coroutines in Kotlin/JS to fetch data from an API:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlinx.browser.window

fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch {
        val response = window.fetch("https://api.example.com/data").await()
        val data = response.json().await()
        console.log(data)
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `fetch` API to retrieve data asynchronously and log it to the console.

#### Building a Full-Stack Application with Kotlin/JS

Kotlin/JS can be used to build full-stack applications by sharing code between the frontend and backend.

##### Sharing Code Between Frontend and Backend

You can share common code between the frontend and backend by using Kotlin's multiplatform capabilities. This allows you to define shared data models and business logic in a common module.

```kotlin
// commonMain module
data class User(val id: Int, val name: String)

// frontendMain module
fun displayUser(user: User) {
    console.log("User: ${user.name}")
}

// backendMain module
fun getUserById(id: Int): User {
    // Retrieve user from database
}
```

In this example, we define a `User` data class in the common module and use it in both the frontend and backend modules.

### Visualizing Kotlin/JS Architecture

To better understand the architecture of a Kotlin/JS application, let's visualize the interaction between Kotlin, JavaScript, and the web browser.

```mermaid

    A[Kotlin Code] -->|Compiles to| B[JavaScript Code]
    B -->|Runs in| C[Web Browser]
    C --> D[DOM Manipulation]
    C --> E[API Calls]
    B --> F[JavaScript Libraries]
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the flow of a Kotlin/JS application. Kotlin code is compiled to JavaScript, which runs in the web browser. The JavaScript code interacts with the DOM for UI updates and makes API calls for data retrieval. It can also utilize existing JavaScript libraries.

### Best Practices for Kotlin/JS Development
