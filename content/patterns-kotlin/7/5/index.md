## 7.5 Partial Application and Currying

In the realm of functional programming, **Partial Application** and **Currying** are two powerful concepts that allow us to create more flexible and reusable code. By understanding and implementing these patterns in Kotlin, we can enhance our ability to write concise and expressive functions. Let's dive into these concepts and explore how they can be applied in Kotlin.

### Understanding Partial Application

**Partial Application** refers to the process of fixing a few arguments of a function, producing another function of smaller arity. This means that you can take a function that requires multiple arguments and create a new function that requires fewer arguments by pre-filling some of the arguments.

#### Key Concepts

- **Arity**: The number of arguments a function takes.
- **Partially Applied Function**: A function that has some of its arguments fixed.

#### Example of Partial Application

Consider a simple function that adds three numbers:

```kotlin
fun addThreeNumbers(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int): Int {
    return a + b + c
}
```

Using partial application, we can create a new function that fixes the first argument:

```kotlin
fun addTwoNumbers(b: Int, c: Int): Int {
    return addThreeNumbers(5, b, c)
}
```

Here, `addTwoNumbers` is a partially applied version of `addThreeNumbers` with the first argument set to `5`.

#### Implementing Partial Application in Kotlin

To implement partial application in Kotlin, we can use higher-order functions. Let's create a generic function that allows partial application:

```kotlin
fun <A, B, C> partialApplication(a: A, function: (A, B) -> C): (B) -> C {
    return { b: B -> function(a, b) }
}
```

Now, let's see how we can use this function:

```kotlin
fun multiply(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x * y

val multiplyBy2 = partialApplication(2, ::multiply)

fun main() {
    println(multiplyBy2(5)) // Output: 10
}
```

In this example, `multiplyBy2` is a partially applied function that multiplies any given number by `2`.

### Visualizing Partial Application

To better understand how partial application works, let's visualize it using a diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Function: addThreeNumbers(a, b, c)] --> B[Partially Applied Function: addTwoNumbers(b, c)]
    B --> C[Result: a + b + c]
    A --> D[Fixed Argument: a = 5]
```

This diagram illustrates how the original function `addThreeNumbers` is transformed into a partially applied function `addTwoNumbers` by fixing the first argument.

### Exploring Currying

**Currying** is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This technique allows us to break down a function into smaller, more manageable pieces.

#### Key Concepts

- **Curried Function**: A function that returns another function as its result.
- **Sequential Application**: Applying arguments one at a time.

#### Example of Currying

Let's revisit the `addThreeNumbers` function and transform it into a curried version:

```kotlin
fun curriedAdd(a: Int): (Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
    return { b: Int -> { c: Int -> a + b + c } }
}
```

Now, we can use this curried function as follows:

```kotlin
val addFive = curriedAdd(5)
val addFiveAndTwo = addFive(2)
val result = addFiveAndTwo(3)

fun main() {
    println(result) // Output: 10
}
```

In this example, `curriedAdd` returns a series of functions, each taking one argument.

#### Implementing Currying in Kotlin

To implement currying in Kotlin, we can create a utility function that transforms a regular function into a curried function:

```kotlin
fun <A, B, C> curry(function: (A, B) -> C): (A) -> (B) -> C {
    return { a: A -> { b: B -> function(a, b) } }
}
```

Let's see how this utility function can be used:

```kotlin
fun subtract(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x - y

val curriedSubtract = curry(::subtract)

fun main() {
    val subtractFrom10 = curriedSubtract(10)
    println(subtractFrom10(3)) // Output: 7
}
```

In this example, `curriedSubtract` is a curried version of the `subtract` function.

### Visualizing Currying

To visualize currying, let's use a diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Function: subtract(x, y)] --> B[Curried Function: curriedSubtract(x)]
    B --> C[Function: subtractFrom10(y)]
    C --> D[Result: x - y]
    A --> E[Sequential Application: x = 10, y = 3]
```

This diagram shows how the original function `subtract` is transformed into a curried function `curriedSubtract`, allowing sequential application of arguments.

### Differences Between Partial Application and Currying

While both partial application and currying involve transforming functions, they serve different purposes:

- **Partial Application**: Fixes some arguments, creating a new function with fewer arguments.
- **Currying**: Transforms a function into a series of functions, each taking one argument.

### Practical Applications

Partial application and currying can be used in various scenarios to improve code reusability and readability:

- **Configuration**: Create functions with default configurations that can be overridden.
- **Event Handling**: Partially apply event handlers with specific contexts.
- **Pipelines**: Build data processing pipelines with curried functions.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following exercises to deepen your understanding:

1. **Modify the `partialApplication` function** to support functions with three arguments.
2. **Create a curried version** of a function that calculates the volume of a box given its length, width, and height.
3. **Use partial application** to create a function that formats strings with a specific prefix.

### Design Considerations

When using partial application and currying, consider the following:

- **Readability**: Ensure that the resulting functions are easy to understand.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the overhead introduced by creating additional functions.
- **Kotlin Features**: Leverage Kotlin's higher-order functions and lambda expressions to simplify implementation.

### Differences and Similarities

Partial application and currying are often confused, but they have distinct characteristics:

- **Partial Application**: Focuses on fixing arguments.
- **Currying**: Focuses on transforming functions into a series of unary functions.

### Conclusion

Partial application and currying are powerful techniques in functional programming that can greatly enhance the flexibility and expressiveness of your code. By mastering these concepts in Kotlin, you can create more modular and reusable functions, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll discover new ways to apply these techniques in your projects. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!
