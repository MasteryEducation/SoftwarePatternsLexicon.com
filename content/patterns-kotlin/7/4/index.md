## 7.4 Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas

In the realm of functional programming, higher-order functions and lambdas are powerful constructs that enable developers to write more expressive, concise, and flexible code. Kotlin, being a modern programming language, embraces these concepts wholeheartedly and provides robust support for them. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of higher-order functions and lambdas, explore function composition and currying, and provide practical examples to illustrate their use.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

**Higher-order functions** are functions that can take other functions as parameters or return them as results. This capability allows for a high degree of abstraction and code reuse, making it easier to build complex functionalities from simpler ones.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Function Parameters**: Higher-order functions can accept functions as arguments, allowing you to pass behavior into functions.
- **Function Return Types**: They can return functions, enabling the creation of function factories or generators.
- **Abstraction**: They abstract common patterns of code, reducing duplication and enhancing readability.

#### Example: A Simple Higher-Order Function

Let's start with a simple example of a higher-order function in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun <T> List<T>.customFilter(predicate: (T) -> Boolean): List<T> {
    val result = mutableListOf<T>()
    for (item in this) {
        if (predicate(item)) {
            result.add(item)
        }
    }
    return result
}

fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val evenNumbers = numbers.customFilter { it % 2 == 0 }
    println(evenNumbers) // Output: [2, 4]
}
```

In this example, `customFilter` is a higher-order function that takes a predicate function as a parameter. This predicate is applied to each element in the list to filter out the elements that do not satisfy the condition.

### Embracing Lambdas

**Lambdas** are anonymous functions that can be defined within expressions. They are a key feature in Kotlin, providing a concise way to represent functions.

#### Syntax and Usage

- **Basic Syntax**: `{ parameter(s) -> expression }`
- **Type Inference**: Kotlin often infers the types of parameters and return types, making lambdas even more succinct.
- **It Keyword**: When a lambda has a single parameter, you can use `it` to refer to the parameter.

#### Example: Using Lambdas

Consider the following example that demonstrates the use of lambdas:

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val doubledNumbers = numbers.map { it * 2 }
println(doubledNumbers) // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Here, the `map` function takes a lambda that doubles each element in the list. The lambda expression `{ it * 2 }` is concise and expressive.

### Function Composition

**Function composition** is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. This is a powerful technique in functional programming that allows you to build complex operations from simpler ones.

#### Composing Functions in Kotlin

In Kotlin, you can compose functions using extension functions. Here's an example:

```kotlin
fun <A, B, C> ((B) -> C).compose(other: (A) -> B): (A) -> C {
    return { a: A -> this(other(a)) }
}

fun main() {
    val multiplyBy2: (Int) -> Int = { it * 2 }
    val add3: (Int) -> Int = { it + 3 }

    val multiplyAndAdd = multiplyBy2.compose(add3)
    println(multiplyAndAdd(5)) // Output: 16
}
```

In this example, `compose` is an extension function that combines two functions: `multiplyBy2` and `add3`. The resulting function first applies `add3` and then `multiplyBy2`.

### Currying

**Currying** is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This technique is useful for creating partially applied functions.

#### Currying in Kotlin

Kotlin does not have built-in support for currying, but you can achieve it using higher-order functions. Here's how you can implement currying:

```kotlin
fun <A, B, C> ((A, B) -> C).curry(): (A) -> (B) -> C {
    return { a: A -> { b: B -> this(a, b) } }
}

fun main() {
    val sum: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b }
    val curriedSum = sum.curry()

    val add5 = curriedSum(5)
    println(add5(10)) // Output: 15
}
```

In this example, the `curry` extension function transforms a two-argument function into a curried version. The `curriedSum` function can then be partially applied with a single argument.

### Practical Applications

Higher-order functions and lambdas are not just theoretical concepts; they have practical applications in real-world programming. Let's explore some scenarios where they shine.

#### Event Handling

In UI programming, higher-order functions and lambdas are often used for event handling. Consider an Android application where you need to handle button clicks:

```kotlin
button.setOnClickListener { view ->
    // Handle button click
    println("Button clicked!")
}
```

Here, the lambda is used to define the behavior that should occur when the button is clicked.

#### Functional Collections

Kotlin's standard library provides a rich set of higher-order functions for collections, such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `fold`. These functions enable you to perform complex operations on collections with ease.

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val sumOfSquares = numbers.map { it * it }.sum()
println(sumOfSquares) // Output: 55
```

In this example, `map` is used to square each element, and `sum` calculates the total.

#### Custom Control Structures

You can create custom control structures using higher-order functions. For instance, you can define a `repeat` function that executes a block of code multiple times:

```kotlin
fun repeat(times: Int, action: (Int) -> Unit) {
    for (i in 0 until times) {
        action(i)
    }
}

fun main() {
    repeat(3) { index ->
        println("Iteration $index")
    }
}
```

The `repeat` function takes an integer and a lambda, executing the lambda for each iteration.

### Visualizing Function Composition and Currying

To better understand how function composition and currying work, let's visualize these concepts using diagrams.

#### Function Composition Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input] --> B[Function f: (B) -> C];
    B --> C[Function g: (A) -> B];
    C --> D[Output];
```

In function composition, the output of one function becomes the input of another, creating a pipeline of transformations.

#### Currying Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Function f: (A, B) -> C] --> B[Curried Function];
    B --> C[Function g: (A) -> (B) -> C];
    C --> D[Partial Application];
    D --> E[Result];
```

Currying transforms a multi-argument function into a series of single-argument functions, allowing for partial application.
