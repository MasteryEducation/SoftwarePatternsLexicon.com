## 14.11 Contract Testing with Pact

In the world of microservices, ensuring that services can communicate reliably is crucial. As systems grow in complexity, traditional integration tests can become cumbersome and brittle. This is where contract testing, and specifically Pact, comes into play. In this section, we will delve into the concept of contract testing with Pact, focusing on consumer-driven contract tests, and how they can be effectively implemented in Kotlin.

### Understanding Contract Testing

**Contract testing** is a method of testing interactions between services by verifying that they adhere to a contract. This contract defines the expected interactions between a consumer (the service making the request) and a provider (the service fulfilling the request). By ensuring that both parties adhere to this contract, we can confidently deploy services independently without fear of breaking integrations.

#### Key Concepts

- **Consumer-Driven Contracts**: The consumer defines the contract, specifying the interactions it expects from the provider. This approach ensures that the provider's API evolves in a way that continues to meet the consumer's needs.
- **Provider States**: These are predefined states that the provider must be in to satisfy the contract. They ensure that the provider can handle the consumer's requests under various conditions.
- **Pact Files**: These are JSON files that store the contracts. They are generated by the consumer tests and used by the provider tests to verify compliance.

### Why Use Pact for Contract Testing?

Pact is a widely-used tool for implementing consumer-driven contract testing. It provides a framework for defining, verifying, and maintaining contracts between microservices. Here are some reasons to consider using Pact:

- **Language Support**: Pact supports multiple languages, including Kotlin, making it a versatile choice for diverse tech stacks.
- **Decoupled Testing**: Pact allows for testing interactions without needing both services to be running simultaneously, reducing the complexity of integration testing.
- **Feedback Loop**: By focusing on consumer-driven contracts, Pact ensures that changes to the provider's API do not break existing consumers, fostering a more collaborative development process.

### Setting Up Pact in a Kotlin Project

To use Pact in a Kotlin project, we need to set up both the consumer and provider tests. Let's walk through the setup process.

#### Adding Dependencies

First, add the necessary dependencies to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    testImplementation("au.com.dius.pact.consumer:junit5:4.3.0")
    testImplementation("au.com.dius.pact.provider:junit5:4.3.0")
}
```

These dependencies include the Pact libraries for both consumer and provider testing, leveraging JUnit 5 for test execution.

### Writing Consumer Tests

Consumer tests are written to define the expected interactions with the provider. These tests generate the Pact files that describe the contract.

#### Example Consumer Test

Let's consider a simple example where our consumer service needs to fetch user data from a provider service.

```kotlin
import au.com.dius.pact.consumer.dsl.PactDslWithProvider
import au.com.dius.pact.consumer.junit5.PactConsumerTestExt
import au.com.dius.pact.consumer.junit5.PactTestFor
import au.com.dius.pact.core.model.RequestResponsePact
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith
import kotlin.test.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

@ExtendWith(PactConsumerTestExt::class)
@PactTestFor(providerName = "UserProvider")
class UserConsumerPactTest {

    @Pact(consumer = "UserConsumer")
    fun createPact(builder: PactDslWithProvider): RequestResponsePact {
        return builder
            .given("User with ID 1 exists")
            .uponReceiving("A request for user data")
            .path("/user/1")
            .method("GET")
            .willRespondWith()
            .status(200)
            .body("""{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe"}""")
            .toPact()
    }

    @Test
    fun testUserData(mockServer: MockServer) {
        val response = khttp.get("${mockServer.getUrl()}/user/1")
        assertEquals(200, response.statusCode)
        assertEquals("John Doe", response.jsonObject.getString("name"))
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a contract for a GET request to `/user/1`, expecting a 200 response with a JSON body. The test verifies that the consumer can handle this response correctly.

### Writing Provider Tests

Provider tests verify that the provider service adheres to the contract defined by the consumer.

#### Example Provider Test

Continuing with our user data example, let's write a provider test to ensure compliance with the contract.

```kotlin
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.PactVerificationContext
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.PactVerificationExtension
import au.com.dius.pact.provider.junit5.PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider
import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestTemplate
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith

@ExtendWith(PactVerificationExtension::class)
class UserProviderPactTest {

    @TestTemplate
    @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider::class)
    fun verifyPact(context: PactVerificationContext) {
        context.verifyInteraction()
    }
}
```

This test uses the PactVerificationExtension to verify that the provider's implementation satisfies the contract. The `verifyInteraction` method checks the provider's response against the expectations defined in the Pact file.

### Visualizing Contract Testing Workflow

To better understand the workflow of contract testing with Pact, let's visualize the process using a Mermaid.js sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Consumer
    participant PactFile
    participant Provider

    Consumer->>PactFile: Generate contract
    Provider->>PactFile: Read contract
    Provider->>Provider: Verify contract
    Consumer->>Provider: Interact based on contract
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the contract testing workflow. The consumer generates a contract, which is stored in a Pact file. The provider reads this contract and verifies its implementation against it. The consumer then interacts with the provider based on the verified contract.

### Best Practices for Contract Testing with Pact

- **Version Control**: Store Pact files in version control to track changes over time and ensure consistency across environments.
- **Automate Verification**: Integrate contract verification into your CI/CD pipeline to catch breaking changes early.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration between consumer and provider teams to ensure that contracts accurately reflect business requirements.

### Common Challenges and Solutions

- **Evolving APIs**: As APIs evolve, contracts must be updated. Use versioning strategies to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility.
- **Complex Interactions**: For complex interactions, break down contracts into smaller, manageable pieces to simplify testing and verification.
- **Environment Parity**: Ensure that test environments closely mirror production to avoid discrepancies in contract verification.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with contract testing using Pact, try modifying the consumer and provider tests to handle additional scenarios, such as:

- Testing error responses, such as 404 or 500 status codes.
- Adding additional fields to the response body and updating the contract accordingly.
- Implementing provider states to test different conditions.
