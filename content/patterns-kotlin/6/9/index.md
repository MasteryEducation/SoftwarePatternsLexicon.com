## 6.9 Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. In Kotlin, the Strategy Pattern can be elegantly implemented using function types and lambdas, making the code more concise and expressive.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Strategy Pattern is to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the client to choose an algorithm at runtime, providing flexibility and promoting the open/closed principle by enabling the addition of new strategies without altering existing code.

### Key Participants

1. **Strategy**: An interface common to all supported algorithms. Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy.
2. **ConcreteStrategy**: Classes that implement the Strategy interface, each providing a different implementation of the algorithm.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object. Context interacts with the Strategy interface to execute the algorithm.

### Applicability

Use the Strategy Pattern when:

- You have multiple related classes that differ only in their behavior.
- You need different variants of an algorithm.
- You want to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures.
- A class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations.

### Implementing Strategy Pattern in Kotlin

Kotlin's support for higher-order functions and lambdas makes it particularly well-suited for implementing the Strategy Pattern. Let's explore how to implement this pattern using Kotlin's features.

#### Traditional Implementation with Interfaces

First, let's look at a traditional implementation using interfaces:

```kotlin
// Strategy interface
interface PaymentStrategy {
    fun pay(amount: Double)
}

// ConcreteStrategy A
class CreditCardStrategy(private val cardNumber: String) : PaymentStrategy {
    override fun pay(amount: Double) {
        println("Paid $$amount using Credit Card ending with ${cardNumber.takeLast(4)}")
    }
}

// ConcreteStrategy B
class PayPalStrategy(private val email: String) : PaymentStrategy {
    override fun pay(amount: Double) {
        println("Paid $$amount using PayPal account $email")
    }
}

// Context
class ShoppingCart {
    private var paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy? = null

    fun setPaymentStrategy(strategy: PaymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = strategy
    }

    fun checkout(amount: Double) {
        paymentStrategy?.pay(amount) ?: println("Payment strategy not set!")
    }
}

// Usage
fun main() {
    val cart = ShoppingCart()
    cart.setPaymentStrategy(CreditCardStrategy("1234-5678-9012-3456"))
    cart.checkout(100.0)

    cart.setPaymentStrategy(PayPalStrategy("user@example.com"))
    cart.checkout(200.0)
}
```

In this example, `PaymentStrategy` is the Strategy interface, `CreditCardStrategy` and `PayPalStrategy` are ConcreteStrategies, and `ShoppingCart` is the Context.

#### Using Function Types and Lambdas

Kotlin allows us to simplify the Strategy Pattern using function types and lambdas, eliminating the need for explicit strategy classes:

```kotlin
// Define a function type for the strategy
typealias PaymentStrategy = (Double) -> Unit

// Context
class ShoppingCart {
    private var paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy? = null

    fun setPaymentStrategy(strategy: PaymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = strategy
    }

    fun checkout(amount: Double) {
        paymentStrategy?.invoke(amount) ?: println("Payment strategy not set!")
    }
}

// Usage
fun main() {
    val cart = ShoppingCart()

    // Using lambdas as strategies
    cart.setPaymentStrategy { amount ->
        println("Paid $$amount using Credit Card")
    }
    cart.checkout(100.0)

    cart.setPaymentStrategy { amount ->
        println("Paid $$amount using PayPal")
    }
    cart.checkout(200.0)
}
```

Here, we define `PaymentStrategy` as a function type `(Double) -> Unit`, and use lambdas to implement different payment strategies. This approach reduces boilerplate code and leverages Kotlin's expressive syntax.

### Design Considerations

When using the Strategy Pattern in Kotlin, consider the following:

- **Flexibility**: The Strategy Pattern provides flexibility by allowing the algorithm to be selected at runtime. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the algorithm needs to change dynamically based on user input or other runtime conditions.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating algorithms in separate classes or functions promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
- **Performance**: Using function types and lambdas can lead to more efficient code, as it reduces the overhead associated with creating and managing multiple concrete strategy classes.
- **Readability**: While using lambdas can make the code more concise, it is essential to ensure that the code remains readable and maintainable. Clear naming conventions and documentation can help achieve this.

### Differences and Similarities

The Strategy Pattern is often confused with the State Pattern. Both patterns involve changing behavior at runtime, but they differ in their intent and implementation:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Focuses on defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable. The client chooses the algorithm to use.
- **State Pattern**: Focuses on allowing an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object itself manages state transitions.

### Visualizing the Strategy Pattern

Let's visualize the Strategy Pattern using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ShoppingCart {
        - PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy
        + setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy)
        + checkout(Double)
    }
    class PaymentStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        + pay(Double)
    }
    class CreditCardStrategy {
        + pay(Double)
    }
    class PayPalStrategy {
        + pay(Double)
    }
    ShoppingCart --> PaymentStrategy
    PaymentStrategy <|-- CreditCardStrategy
    PaymentStrategy <|-- PayPalStrategy
```

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the `ShoppingCart` (Context), `PaymentStrategy` (Strategy), and its concrete implementations (`CreditCardStrategy` and `PayPalStrategy`).

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Strategy Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- **Add a new payment strategy**: Implement a new strategy, such as `BitcoinStrategy`, and integrate it into the `ShoppingCart`.
- **Use a different context**: Create a new context, such as an `OrderProcessor`, that uses the Strategy Pattern to handle different order processing algorithms.
- **Experiment with lambdas**: Try using different lambda expressions as strategies, and observe how they affect the behavior of the `ShoppingCart`.
