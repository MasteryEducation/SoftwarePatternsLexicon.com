## 6.3 Interpreter Pattern

The Interpreter Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate sentences in a language. It is particularly useful for defining a grammar for a language and interpreting sentences in that language. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Interpreter Pattern in Kotlin, leveraging Kotlin's unique features such as sealed classes and pattern matching.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Interpreter Pattern is to define a representation for a grammar of a language and provide an interpreter to evaluate sentences in that language. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a simple language or a set of commands that need to be interpreted.

### Key Participants

1. **Abstract Expression**: Declares an abstract `interpret` operation that is common to all nodes in the abstract syntax tree.
2. **Terminal Expression**: Implements an `interpret` operation associated with terminal symbols in the grammar.
3. **Nonterminal Expression**: Represents rules in the grammar. It maintains references to other expressions and implements the `interpret` operation for nonterminal symbols.
4. **Context**: Contains information that is global to the interpreter.
5. **Client**: Builds the abstract syntax tree representing a particular sentence in the language defined by the grammar.

### Applicability

Use the Interpreter Pattern when:

- You have a simple language or grammar that needs to be interpreted.
- The grammar is simple and can be represented using a class hierarchy.
- You need to evaluate expressions in a language frequently.

### Building Parsers with Recursive Descent

Recursive descent parsing is a top-down parsing technique that uses a set of recursive procedures to process the input. Each procedure corresponds to a nonterminal in the grammar. Let's explore how to build a parser using recursive descent in Kotlin.

#### Example: Arithmetic Expression Interpreter

Consider a simple arithmetic expression language with the following grammar:

```
Expression ::= Term ('+' Term)*
Term       ::= Factor ('*' Factor)*
Factor     ::= Number | '(' Expression ')'
Number     ::= [0-9]+
```

We will build an interpreter for this language using recursive descent parsing.

#### Step 1: Define the Abstract Expression

First, define an abstract class `Expression` with an `interpret` method:

```kotlin
abstract class Expression {
    abstract fun interpret(): Int
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Terminal Expressions

Implement terminal expressions for numbers:

```kotlin
class NumberExpression(private val number: Int) : Expression() {
    override fun interpret(): Int = number
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement Nonterminal Expressions

Implement nonterminal expressions for addition and multiplication:

```kotlin
class AddExpression(private val left: Expression, private val right: Expression) : Expression() {
    override fun interpret(): Int = left.interpret() + right.interpret()
}

class MultiplyExpression(private val left: Expression, private val right: Expression) : Expression() {
    override fun interpret(): Int = left.interpret() * right.interpret()
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement the Parser

Implement a parser using recursive descent:

```kotlin
class Parser(private val tokens: List<String>) {
    private var currentPosition = 0

    fun parse(): Expression {
        return parseExpression()
    }

    private fun parseExpression(): Expression {
        var result = parseTerm()
        while (currentToken() == "+") {
            consumeToken("+")
            result = AddExpression(result, parseTerm())
        }
        return result
    }

    private fun parseTerm(): Expression {
        var result = parseFactor()
        while (currentToken() == "*") {
            consumeToken("*")
            result = MultiplyExpression(result, parseFactor())
        }
        return result
    }

    private fun parseFactor(): Expression {
        val token = currentToken()
        return when {
            token.matches(Regex("\\d+")) -> {
                consumeToken(token)
                NumberExpression(token.toInt())
            }
            token == "(" -> {
                consumeToken("(")
                val expression = parseExpression()
                consumeToken(")")
                expression
            }
            else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Unexpected token: $token")
        }
    }

    private fun currentToken(): String = tokens[currentPosition]

    private fun consumeToken(expected: String) {
        if (currentToken() == expected) {
            currentPosition++
        } else {
            throw IllegalArgumentException("Expected $expected but found ${currentToken()}")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Test the Interpreter

Finally, test the interpreter:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val expression = "(3 + 5) * 2"
    val tokens = expression.replace("(", " ( ").replace(")", " ) ").split("\\s+".toRegex()).filter { it.isNotEmpty() }
    val parser = Parser(tokens)
    val result = parser.parse().interpret()
    println("Result: $result") // Output: Result: 16
}
```

### Using Sealed Classes and Pattern Matching

Kotlin's sealed classes and pattern matching provide a powerful way to implement the Interpreter Pattern. Sealed classes allow you to define a restricted class hierarchy, which is perfect for representing grammar rules.

#### Example: Boolean Expression Interpreter

Consider a simple boolean expression language with the following grammar:

```
Expression ::= Term ('OR' Term)*
Term       ::= Factor ('AND' Factor)*
Factor     ::= 'TRUE' | 'FALSE' | '(' Expression ')'
```

#### Step 1: Define Sealed Classes

Define sealed classes for expressions:

```kotlin
sealed class BooleanExpression {
    abstract fun interpret(): Boolean
}

data class TrueExpression(val value: Boolean = true) : BooleanExpression() {
    override fun interpret(): Boolean = value
}

data class FalseExpression(val value: Boolean = false) : BooleanExpression() {
    override fun interpret(): Boolean = value
}

data class OrExpression(val left: BooleanExpression, val right: BooleanExpression) : BooleanExpression() {
    override fun interpret(): Boolean = left.interpret() || right.interpret()
}

data class AndExpression(val left: BooleanExpression, val right: BooleanExpression) : BooleanExpression() {
    override fun interpret(): Boolean = left.interpret() && right.interpret()
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Parser

Implement a parser using sealed classes:

```kotlin
class BooleanParser(private val tokens: List<String>) {
    private var currentPosition = 0

    fun parse(): BooleanExpression {
        return parseExpression()
    }

    private fun parseExpression(): BooleanExpression {
        var result = parseTerm()
        while (currentToken() == "OR") {
            consumeToken("OR")
            result = OrExpression(result, parseTerm())
        }
        return result
    }

    private fun parseTerm(): BooleanExpression {
        var result = parseFactor()
        while (currentToken() == "AND") {
            consumeToken("AND")
            result = AndExpression(result, parseFactor())
        }
        return result
    }

    private fun parseFactor(): BooleanExpression {
        val token = currentToken()
        return when (token) {
            "TRUE" -> {
                consumeToken("TRUE")
                TrueExpression()
            }
            "FALSE" -> {
                consumeToken("FALSE")
                FalseExpression()
            }
            "(" -> {
                consumeToken("(")
                val expression = parseExpression()
                consumeToken(")")
                expression
            }
            else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Unexpected token: $token")
        }
    }

    private fun currentToken(): String = tokens[currentPosition]

    private fun consumeToken(expected: String) {
        if (currentToken() == expected) {
            currentPosition++
        } else {
            throw IllegalArgumentException("Expected $expected but found ${currentToken()}")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Test the Interpreter

Test the boolean expression interpreter:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val expression = "(TRUE AND FALSE) OR TRUE"
    val tokens = expression.replace("(", " ( ").replace(")", " ) ").split("\\s+".toRegex()).filter { it.isNotEmpty() }
    val parser = BooleanParser(tokens)
    val result = parser.parse().interpret()
    println("Result: $result") // Output: Result: true
}
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing the Interpreter Pattern, consider the following:

- **Complexity**: The Interpreter Pattern can lead to a large number of classes for complex grammars. Consider using other parsing techniques for more complex languages.
- **Performance**: Recursive descent parsing can be inefficient for large inputs. Consider optimizing the parser or using a different parsing strategy if performance is a concern.
- **Kotlin Features**: Leverage Kotlin's sealed classes and pattern matching to simplify the implementation and improve type safety.

### Differences and Similarities

The Interpreter Pattern is often confused with the Visitor Pattern. While both patterns involve traversing a structure, the Interpreter Pattern focuses on evaluating expressions, whereas the Visitor Pattern is used to perform operations on elements of an object structure.

### Visualizing the Interpreter Pattern

Below is a class diagram illustrating the structure of the Interpreter Pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Expression {
        <<abstract>>
        +interpret(): Int
    }
    class NumberExpression {
        +interpret(): Int
    }
    class AddExpression {
        +interpret(): Int
    }
    class MultiplyExpression {
        +interpret(): Int
    }
    Expression <|-- NumberExpression
    Expression <|-- AddExpression
    Expression <|-- MultiplyExpression
```
