## 6.6 Memento Pattern

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and restore the state of an object without violating its encapsulation. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to provide undo functionality or save the state of an object at a particular point in time. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Memento Pattern in Kotlin, leveraging Kotlin's powerful features such as data classes and serialization.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Memento Pattern is to capture the internal state of an object so that it can be restored to that state later. This is achieved without exposing the object's internal structure or implementation details. The pattern is composed of three main participants:

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. **Memento**: A representation of the saved state.
3. **Caretaker**: Manages the mementos and is responsible for storing and restoring the state.

### Key Participants

- **Originator**: This is the object whose state you want to save. It creates a memento containing a snapshot of its current state and uses the memento to restore its state.
- **Memento**: This is a value object that acts as a snapshot of the originator's state. It is immutable and only accessible by the originator.
- **Caretaker**: This is responsible for keeping track of mementos. It requests a memento from the originator, stores it, and later provides it back to the originator when needed.

### Applicability

Use the Memento Pattern when:

- You need to save and restore the state of an object.
- You want to implement undo functionality.
- You want to maintain encapsulation boundaries by not exposing the internal state of an object.

### Implementing Mementos with Data Classes

Kotlin's data classes are a perfect fit for implementing mementos due to their concise syntax and built-in support for copying and equality checking. Let's walk through an example of implementing the Memento Pattern in Kotlin.

#### Example: Text Editor with Undo Functionality

Imagine a simple text editor where you want to implement undo functionality. The editor will be our originator, and we will use a data class to represent the memento.

```kotlin
// Originator
class TextEditor {
    private var text: String = ""

    fun write(newText: String) {
        text += newText
    }

    fun getText(): String = text

    fun save(): Memento = Memento(text)

    fun restore(memento: Memento) {
        text = memento.state
    }

    // Memento
    data class Memento(val state: String)
}

// Caretaker
class Caretaker {
    private val mementos: MutableList<TextEditor.Memento> = mutableListOf()

    fun addMemento(memento: TextEditor.Memento) {
        mementos.add(memento)
    }

    fun getMemento(index: Int): TextEditor.Memento? {
        return if (index in mementos.indices) mementos[index] else null
    }
}

fun main() {
    val editor = TextEditor()
    val caretaker = Caretaker()

    editor.write("Hello, ")
    caretaker.addMemento(editor.save())

    editor.write("World!")
    caretaker.addMemento(editor.save())

    println("Current Text: ${editor.getText()}") // Output: Hello, World!

    editor.restore(caretaker.getMemento(0)!!)
    println("After Undo: ${editor.getText()}") // Output: Hello, 
}
```

### Caretaker Management of Mementos

The caretaker is responsible for managing the mementos. It stores the mementos and provides them back to the originator when needed. In the above example, the `Caretaker` class uses a list to store mementos. This allows us to implement undo functionality by restoring the previous state of the text editor.

### Serialization Considerations

When implementing the Memento Pattern, especially in distributed systems or applications that require persistence, serialization becomes an important consideration. Kotlin provides several options for serialization, including the kotlinx.serialization library.

#### Example: Serializing Mementos

Let's extend our text editor example to include serialization of mementos.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*
import kotlinx.serialization.json.*

// Memento with Serialization
@Serializable
data class SerializableMemento(val state: String)

class SerializableTextEditor {
    private var text: String = ""

    fun write(newText: String) {
        text += newText
    }

    fun getText(): String = text

    fun save(): SerializableMemento = SerializableMemento(text)

    fun restore(memento: SerializableMemento) {
        text = memento.state
    }
}

fun main() {
    val editor = SerializableTextEditor()
    editor.write("Hello, Kotlin!")

    // Serialize the memento
    val memento = editor.save()
    val json = Json.encodeToString(memento)
    println("Serialized Memento: $json")

    // Deserialize the memento
    val deserializedMemento = Json.decodeFromString<SerializableMemento>(json)
    editor.restore(deserializedMemento)
    println("Restored Text: ${editor.getText()}") // Output: Hello, Kotlin!
}
```

### Design Considerations

When using the Memento Pattern, consider the following:

- **Memory Usage**: Storing multiple mementos can consume significant memory, especially if the state is large. Consider using compression or limiting the number of stored mementos.
- **Serialization**: Ensure that the memento is serializable if you need to persist it. Use Kotlin's serialization library for efficient serialization and deserialization.
- **Immutability**: Mementos should be immutable to prevent accidental changes to the saved state.

### Differences and Similarities

The Memento Pattern is often compared with the Command Pattern, as both can be used to implement undo functionality. However, the Command Pattern focuses on encapsulating actions as objects, whereas the Memento Pattern focuses on capturing and restoring state. Use the Memento Pattern when you need to save the state of an object, and the Command Pattern when you need to encapsulate operations.

### Visualizing the Memento Pattern

To better understand the Memento Pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the originator, memento, and caretaker using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TextEditor {
        - String text
        + write(newText: String)
        + getText(): String
        + save(): Memento
        + restore(memento: Memento)
    }

    class Memento {
        - String state
    }

    class Caretaker {
        - List~Memento~ mementos
        + addMemento(memento: Memento)
        + getMemento(index: Int): Memento
    }

    TextEditor --> Memento
    Caretaker --> Memento
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Memento Pattern by modifying the code examples:

- **Add Redo Functionality**: Extend the caretaker to support redo operations by maintaining a separate stack for undone mementos.
- **Limit Memento Storage**: Implement a mechanism to limit the number of stored mementos, such as a fixed-size queue.
- **Enhance Serialization**: Explore different serialization formats, such as XML or ProtoBuf, and compare their performance.
