## 6.15 Event Sourcing Pattern

### Introduction to Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that captures all changes to the application state as a sequence of events. Instead of storing the current state of an object, Event Sourcing records every change as an event. This allows the system to reconstruct past states by replaying these events. Event Sourcing is particularly useful in systems where auditability, traceability, and the ability to reconstruct historical states are crucial.

### Intent

The primary intent of the Event Sourcing pattern is to ensure that every change to the state of an application is captured as an event object. These events are stored in an event store, which acts as the source of truth for the system's state. By replaying these events, you can reconstruct the state of the application at any point in time.

### Key Participants

- **Event**: Represents a change in the state of the application.
- **Event Store**: A storage mechanism for persisting events.
- **Aggregate**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
- **Command**: An instruction to perform an action that results in one or more events.
- **Event Handler**: A component that processes events and updates the read model.

### Applicability

Event Sourcing is applicable in scenarios where:

- **Auditability**: You need a complete audit trail of changes to the system.
- **Traceability**: You want to trace the origin of changes and understand the sequence of events.
- **Complex Business Logic**: The business logic involves complex state transitions that are better represented as events.
- **Reconstructing State**: You need to reconstruct past states of the application for debugging or analysis.

### Implementing Event Sourcing in Kotlin

Let's explore how to implement Event Sourcing in Kotlin by building a simple bank account application. We'll capture account transactions as events and use them to reconstruct the account's balance.

#### Step 1: Define Events

First, define the events that represent changes to the account state.

```kotlin
sealed class AccountEvent {
    data class AccountCreated(val accountId: String, val initialBalance: Double) : AccountEvent()
    data class MoneyDeposited(val accountId: String, val amount: Double) : AccountEvent()
    data class MoneyWithdrawn(val accountId: String, val amount: Double) : AccountEvent()
}
```

#### Step 2: Create an Event Store

Next, create an event store to persist events. For simplicity, we'll use an in-memory list.

```kotlin
class EventStore {
    private val events = mutableListOf<AccountEvent>()

    fun save(event: AccountEvent) {
        events.add(event)
    }

    fun getEvents(): List<AccountEvent> = events.toList()
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement Command Handling

Commands represent actions that result in events. Implement command handling to process these actions.

```kotlin
class AccountService(private val eventStore: EventStore) {

    fun createAccount(accountId: String, initialBalance: Double) {
        val event = AccountEvent.AccountCreated(accountId, initialBalance)
        eventStore.save(event)
    }

    fun depositMoney(accountId: String, amount: Double) {
        val event = AccountEvent.MoneyDeposited(accountId, amount)
        eventStore.save(event)
    }

    fun withdrawMoney(accountId: String, amount: Double) {
        val event = AccountEvent.MoneyWithdrawn(accountId, amount)
        eventStore.save(event)
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Reconstruct State from Events

To reconstruct the account's state, replay the events from the event store.

```kotlin
class AccountProjection(private val eventStore: EventStore) {

    fun getBalance(accountId: String): Double {
        return eventStore.getEvents()
            .filter { it is AccountEvent && it.accountId == accountId }
            .fold(0.0) { balance, event ->
                when (event) {
                    is AccountEvent.AccountCreated -> event.initialBalance
                    is AccountEvent.MoneyDeposited -> balance + event.amount
                    is AccountEvent.MoneyWithdrawn -> balance - event.amount
                }
            }
    }
}
```

### Visualizing Event Sourcing

Here is a visual representation of the Event Sourcing process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Command
    participant EventStore
    participant EventHandler
    participant ReadModel

    User ->> Command: Create Account
    Command ->> EventStore: Save AccountCreated Event
    EventStore ->> EventHandler: Notify Event
    EventHandler ->> ReadModel: Update Balance

    User ->> Command: Deposit Money
    Command ->> EventStore: Save MoneyDeposited Event
    EventStore ->> EventHandler: Notify Event
    EventHandler ->> ReadModel: Update Balance

    User ->> Command: Withdraw Money
    Command ->> EventStore: Save MoneyWithdrawn Event
    EventStore ->> EventHandler: Notify Event
    EventHandler ->> ReadModel: Update Balance
```

### Design Considerations

When implementing Event Sourcing, consider the following:

- **Event Versioning**: As your application evolves, events may change. Implement versioning to handle changes gracefully.
- **Event Consistency**: Ensure that events are consistent and accurately reflect the changes in the system.
- **Performance**: Replaying events can be resource-intensive. Consider using snapshots to optimize performance.
- **Scalability**: Design the event store to handle a large volume of events efficiently.

### Differences and Similarities

Event Sourcing is often confused with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern. While both patterns can be used together, they serve different purposes. Event Sourcing focuses on capturing changes as events, while CQRS separates the read and write models.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples by modifying the events or adding new command types. For instance, try implementing a transfer money command that involves two accounts.
