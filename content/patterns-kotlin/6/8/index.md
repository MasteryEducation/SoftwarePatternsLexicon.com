## 6.8 State Pattern

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on its state. By encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes, the State Pattern promotes cleaner, more maintainable code by avoiding complex conditional logic.

### Intent

The primary intent of the State Pattern is to allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is useful in scenarios where an object can be in one of several states, and the behavior of the object changes based on its current state.

### Key Participants

1. **Context**: Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
2. **State**: Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.
3. **ConcreteState**: Implements the behavior associated with a state of the Context.

### Applicability

Use the State Pattern when:

- An object’s behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
- Operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object’s state. The State Pattern puts each branch of the conditional in a separate class.

### Implementing the State Pattern in Kotlin

Kotlin provides powerful features such as sealed classes and enum classes that can be effectively used to implement the State Pattern. These features allow for a more idiomatic and concise implementation of the pattern.

#### Using Sealed Classes

Sealed classes in Kotlin are a great fit for implementing the State Pattern because they allow you to define a restricted class hierarchy. This means you can define a set of subclasses that are known at compile time, which makes it easier to handle state transitions and encapsulation.

```kotlin
// Define the State interface
sealed class State {
    abstract fun handle(context: Context)
}

// Concrete States
class StateA : State() {
    override fun handle(context: Context) {
        println("StateA handling request.")
        context.state = StateB() // Transition to StateB
    }
}

class StateB : State() {
    override fun handle(context: Context) {
        println("StateB handling request.")
        context.state = StateA() // Transition to StateA
    }
}

// Context class
class Context(var state: State) {
    fun request() {
        state.handle(this)
    }
}

// Usage
fun main() {
    val context = Context(StateA())
    context.request() // StateA handling request.
    context.request() // StateB handling request.
}
```

In this example, we define a `State` sealed class with two concrete states: `StateA` and `StateB`. The `Context` class maintains a reference to a `State` object and delegates state-specific behavior to this object. The `handle` method in each state class defines the behavior and transitions to the next state.

#### Using Enum Classes

Enum classes can also be used to implement the State Pattern, especially when the number of states is fixed and known at compile time. Enum classes provide a simple way to define a set of constants, each of which can have its own behavior.

```kotlin
// Define the State enum
enum class State {
    STATE_A {
        override fun handle(context: Context) {
            println("StateA handling request.")
            context.state = STATE_B // Transition to StateB
        }
    },
    STATE_B {
        override fun handle(context: Context) {
            println("StateB handling request.")
            context.state = STATE_A // Transition to StateA
        }
    };

    abstract fun handle(context: Context)
}

// Context class
class Context(var state: State) {
    fun request() {
        state.handle(this)
    }
}

// Usage
fun main() {
    val context = Context(State.STATE_A)
    context.request() // StateA handling request.
    context.request() // StateB handling request.
}
```

In this example, each constant in the `State` enum class overrides the `handle` method to define its behavior and transition logic. The `Context` class interacts with the current state in a similar manner as with sealed classes.

### State Transitions and Encapsulation

State transitions are a crucial aspect of the State Pattern. In the examples above, state transitions are handled within the `handle` method of each state. This encapsulates the logic for transitioning from one state to another within the state classes themselves, promoting a clean separation of concerns.

Encapsulation is achieved by keeping the state-specific behavior and transition logic within the state classes. The `Context` class is only responsible for maintaining the current state and delegating requests to the state object. This separation of responsibilities makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

### Design Considerations

When implementing the State Pattern, consider the following:

- **Complexity**: The State Pattern can introduce additional complexity by requiring a class for each state. However, this complexity is often offset by the clarity and maintainability it provides.
- **State Explosion**: If there are a large number of states, the number of classes can grow significantly. Consider using other patterns like the Strategy Pattern if the number of states becomes unwieldy.
- **State Transitions**: Ensure that state transitions are well-defined and that the system can handle unexpected transitions gracefully.

### Differences and Similarities

The State Pattern is often confused with the Strategy Pattern. While both patterns involve encapsulating behavior, they serve different purposes:

- **State Pattern**: Focuses on changing behavior based on the state of the object. The state itself can change over time.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Focuses on selecting an algorithm or behavior at runtime. The strategy is typically chosen at the start and does not change.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the State Pattern, try modifying the code examples above:

- Add a new state and define its behavior.
- Implement a more complex state transition logic.
- Use the State Pattern in a real-world scenario, such as a traffic light system or a vending machine.

### Visualizing State Transitions

To better understand how state transitions work in the State Pattern, consider the following state transition diagram for a simple traffic light system:

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Red
    Red --> Green: Timer expires
    Green --> Yellow: Timer expires
    Yellow --> Red: Timer expires
```

In this diagram, the traffic light system transitions between three states: Red, Green, and Yellow. Each state transition occurs when a timer expires, illustrating a simple yet effective use of the State Pattern.
