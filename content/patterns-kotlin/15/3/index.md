## 15.3 Data Encryption

In today's digital age, data security is paramount. As software engineers and architects, understanding how to encrypt sensitive data is crucial to protecting user information and maintaining trust. In this section, we'll delve into data encryption techniques using Kotlin, focusing on Kotlin Serialization with encryption. We'll explore concepts, provide code examples, and offer best practices for implementing secure data encryption in your Kotlin applications.

### Understanding Data Encryption

Data encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. This process ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains secure. Encryption can be applied to data at rest (stored data) and data in transit (data being transmitted over a network).

#### Key Concepts

- **Plaintext**: The original, readable data.
- **Ciphertext**: The encrypted, unreadable data.
- **Encryption Key**: A string of bits used by an encryption algorithm to transform plaintext into ciphertext.
- **Decryption**: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a decryption key.

### Types of Encryption

There are two primary types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric.

#### Symmetric Encryption

In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This method is fast and efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. However, key management can be challenging since the same key must be securely shared between parties.

**Example Algorithms**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This method is more secure for key distribution but is slower than symmetric encryption.

**Example Algorithms**: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

### Implementing Encryption in Kotlin

Kotlin provides robust support for encryption through its interoperability with Java's security libraries. Let's explore how to implement both symmetric and asymmetric encryption in Kotlin.

#### Symmetric Encryption with AES

AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm. Here's how you can implement AES encryption in Kotlin:

```kotlin
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator
import javax.crypto.SecretKey
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec
import java.util.Base64

fun generateAESKey(): SecretKey {
    val keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")
    keyGen.init(256) // Key size: 128, 192, or 256 bits
    return keyGen.generateKey()
}

fun encryptAES(plainText: String, secretKey: SecretKey): String {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES")
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
    val encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(plainText.toByteArray())
    return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes)
}

fun decryptAES(cipherText: String, secretKey: SecretKey): String {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES")
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
    val decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(cipherText))
    return String(decryptedBytes)
}

fun main() {
    val secretKey = generateAESKey()
    val originalText = "Sensitive Data"
    val encryptedText = encryptAES(originalText, secretKey)
    val decryptedText = decryptAES(encryptedText, secretKey)

    println("Original: $originalText")
    println("Encrypted: $encryptedText")
    println("Decrypted: $decryptedText")
}
```

**Key Points**:
- We use `KeyGenerator` to generate a secure AES key.
- The `Cipher` class is used to perform encryption and decryption.
- Base64 encoding is applied to the ciphertext for safe storage and transmission.

#### Asymmetric Encryption with RSA

RSA is a popular asymmetric encryption algorithm. Here's how you can implement RSA encryption in Kotlin:

```kotlin
import java.security.KeyPair
import java.security.KeyPairGenerator
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import java.util.Base64

fun generateRSAKeyPair(): KeyPair {
    val keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA")
    keyGen.initialize(2048) // Key size
    return keyGen.generateKeyPair()
}

fun encryptRSA(plainText: String, publicKey: java.security.PublicKey): String {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA")
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey)
    val encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(plainText.toByteArray())
    return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes)
}

fun decryptRSA(cipherText: String, privateKey: java.security.PrivateKey): String {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA")
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey)
    val decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(cipherText))
    return String(decryptedBytes)
}

fun main() {
    val keyPair = generateRSAKeyPair()
    val originalText = "Sensitive Data"
    val encryptedText = encryptRSA(originalText, keyPair.public)
    val decryptedText = decryptRSA(encryptedText, keyPair.private)

    println("Original: $originalText")
    println("Encrypted: $encryptedText")
    println("Decrypted: $decryptedText")
}
```

**Key Points**:
- `KeyPairGenerator` is used to generate RSA key pairs.
- RSA keys are typically larger (2048 bits or more) to ensure security.
- The public key encrypts data, while the private key decrypts it.

### Using Kotlin Serialization with Encryption

Kotlin Serialization is a powerful library for converting Kotlin objects to and from various formats like JSON, ProtoBuf, etc. By integrating encryption, we can ensure that serialized data remains secure.

#### Setting Up Kotlin Serialization

First, add the Kotlin Serialization library to your project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.3.0")
}
```

#### Encrypting Serialized Data

Let's encrypt serialized JSON data using AES:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*
import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator
import javax.crypto.SecretKey
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec
import java.util.Base64

@Serializable
data class UserData(val username: String, val password: String)

fun encryptSerializedData(data: UserData, secretKey: SecretKey): String {
    val jsonData = Json.encodeToString(data)
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES")
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
    val encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(jsonData.toByteArray())
    return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes)
}

fun decryptSerializedData(encryptedData: String, secretKey: SecretKey): UserData {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES")
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
    val decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encryptedData))
    val jsonData = String(decryptedBytes)
    return Json.decodeFromString(jsonData)
}

fun main() {
    val secretKey = generateAESKey()
    val userData = UserData("user123", "securePassword")
    val encryptedData = encryptSerializedData(userData, secretKey)
    val decryptedData = decryptSerializedData(encryptedData, secretKey)

    println("Original: $userData")
    println("Encrypted: $encryptedData")
    println("Decrypted: $decryptedData")
}
```

**Key Points**:
- We serialize the `UserData` object to JSON using Kotlin Serialization.
- The JSON string is then encrypted using AES.
- The encrypted data is Base64 encoded for safe storage or transmission.

### Best Practices for Data Encryption

When implementing data encryption, consider the following best practices:

1. **Use Strong Keys**: Ensure encryption keys are of sufficient length and complexity.
2. **Secure Key Management**: Store keys securely, using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services.
3. **Encrypt Sensitive Data Only**: Avoid encrypting non-sensitive data to minimize performance overhead.
4. **Regularly Rotate Keys**: Change encryption keys periodically to enhance security.
5. **Use Established Libraries**: Rely on well-tested libraries and avoid implementing encryption algorithms from scratch.
6. **Consider Performance**: Balance security with performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.

### Visualizing Encryption Process

Let's visualize the encryption process using a flowchart:

```mermaid
